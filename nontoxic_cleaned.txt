australian federal election 1901 i thought you might like to know that the pendulum you added has had removal attempted you may wish to contribute to talkpage discussion jackie trad errr well it might be kind of skating close to original research use of unreliable social media etc but she mentioned it was her birthday on 25 april twice on twitter and the courier mail said she was 40 on 7 april so i kind of worked it out from that i will remove it if you are not comfortable with it i am happy to wait for a firm independent source such as a parliamentary bio wow you have done all the federal by elections love your work i honestly never thought australian politics on wikipedia would develop to what it is today it is now done federally i wonder if wikipedia will ever reach the point of having an article for every state election every state by election and every state mp a barnstar for you the original barnstar for your work on australian politicians melbourne state by election 2012 and australian christians i do not suppose you would like to do the honours i will try to get something of value on these guys together this weekend i remember having an attempt back when they were first registered with the aec but i had a lot of difficulty working out exactly what their relationship with the cdp was they seem to be what used to be the victorian branch of the cdp with possibly several others still affiliated with them somehow hopefully there some more info around now especially with this by election in the works i had a look at the by election page and fixed up the candidates table a little it was listing candidates of the democrats secular party and sep none of which are registered in victoria i have noticed though that antony has started listing unregistered parties in much the same way as registered ones so this will be worth keeping an eye on in the future thanks colours and images in member list pages what is the logic behind adding these looks like a lot of work for something that well hurts my eyes talkback sutherland shire careful you are reverting vandalism back into the article presumably unintentional 60 241 63 163 note yes i was mistakenly division of boothby a why put the parentheses around sir b with john mcleay sr and john mcleay jr it was clear they were two different people and clear they were related with your changes this is no longer clear your thoughts cheers hi after a brief note at wt aup where i hardly ever get responses any more so i did not wait that long i have been implementing these sirs in the member lists with regards to boothby i am glad you brought that up it was one of the only ones i trouble with if you would prefer

i question why he would need protection when he is erasing his talk page unethically a discssion was occuring between mutiple people sinebot was activated and elkevbo erased the information is it not proper protocol to have a discussion on talk pages about disagreements and to erase the discussion both bad form and unbecoming of an editor i urge that elkevbo not receive protection for his user page based on his troublesome erasing of his talk page as can be viewed in his user history
okay i see you accused me of being one of them
the aim is not to delist the article but to fix it

more npov issues this article is pretty sloppy as i think most people can tell i took out the section on first cause as revised by nodem which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious which is not really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic maybe i went a bit far i just object to statements like the entirety of space time came into existence at some point unless you define this point embedded in a larger space time outside of our own the fallacy comes from implying that both the statements space time is everything and something exists outside of space time are true however i work in computer software and do not do physics although this is really about philosophy so maybe i am just using the the wrong kind of logic if time is finite then there must be a beginning which is what i think is meant by at some point i do not think the phrase came into existence at some point necessarily implies any metaphysical cause ie thing being outside the universe does it 06 59 22 dec 2004 utc i was not really comfortable with the version that came before it though first cause is a complex topic or at least a lot has been said about it and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy if someone could write a good article about the first cause debate and maybe link to it from this article that would be good i am not really qualified to do it also and i have not made an edit about this i am uncomfortable as a physicist with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism while many do and they may be right i can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one oops forgot to login i am misterbailey if anyone was wondering you are right to question the most astronomers biti will put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces i have been working on deterministic system philosophy where i put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism but it is a complex subject i agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes and i agree that this article is sort of sloppy perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up

i disagree 1 like all encyclopedias wikipedia has a good article on machiavellianism, i choose the word machiavellian because its accuracy and political connotation but also because it sounds far less melodramatic that the word evil which is the word used by some sources
the entire article though very exhaustive and informative is a bit biased one important point this the article fails to mention either deliberately or due to lack of knowledge is that hindus are also opposed to the ucc this is because once the ucc comes into force the tax benifits accuring due to the huf hindu undived family in the income tax acts will become untennabe constitutionaly another thing about the subsidies given to muslims for haj there are some hindu equivalents for instance hindu pilgrims to amarnath get subsidies amounting to rs 5000

romanticide live i have removed this sentence romanticide was only performed with anette olzon on vocals in 2008 romanticide premiered live in 2009 at brixton academy in london it featured marco and anette on vocals if someone wants to put a corrected sentence to this effect back into the article feel free however i do not think it worth it as that part of the article is detailing songs that have not been played live

i think we are all in general agreement with brian edits and comments we must try to find critical coverage of interesting information about more of his roles if not i say we remove most of them or briefly mention a minor film and not his costars if it is not that notable above all we want the article to read as a biography not a filmography recital but i am also keen to make it pretty comprehensive and certainly not ignoring his more notable roles dr blofeld

proposed changes to the article so as to avoid reversion struggles 1 that possible vowel inventories be exanded to 10 distinct vowels after vance 2 that discussion of diphthongs be expanded after vance 3 that discussion of j r be exanded to include the possibility of 1 two r phonemes and 2 more allophones than the ones described in the article source would be trubetskoi book and labrune article i would point out that vance is about the only english language book we have that is devoted to the topic of japanese phonology and it is a standard source on the topic even it is limited in its approach by traditional phonemic description and does not make use of alternatives such as natural phonology and articulatory phonology speak now if you cannot live with these 133 7 7 240

i do not understand how you can claim that other uses 4 or otherwise has any kind of meaning to anyone other than the one that wrote it and possibly you it seems if the templates are changed then that either means that the display should also be changed or that it is the reason they are changing the template either way the change itself would likely nullify this argument i agree with magio above this seems to be nothing more than a subtle way at irritating other editors by somehow logically trying to argue nonsense

re silent films by some virtue i have been addressing errors in the historical record and submitting corrections to different venues for all matter of silent film works i am liking how later productions by most companies have plenty of images and background works to go by as long as errors like this exist i will have to be on my toes i am sure you know the whole verifiability not truth and no original research but some original research quickly clears up such errors and shows how prevalent they are in almost all topics so much of that film still is totally wrong it is robert mcwade in the 1912 vitagraph production zoom in if you do not believe me i have actually submitted several other film still identifications but i do not want to be a pain most people know wikipedia is not infallible but most people do not understand that so many books and other sources are also very flawed only 1000 thanhouser films left to go oh yes you have to be very careful even otherwise reliable sources get it wrong

peter birks peter birks dear legis i have had to revert most of the edits made to the article peter birks because they were virtually indistinguishable from jack beatson peter birks obituary the guardian 16 july 2004 accessed 18 august 2009 you appear to be the editor who was responsible for reproducing a large quantity of copyright material in this article i am surprised to find this kind of editing being done by a lawyer with a first class degree just to show to what an extent you had plagiarised the material compare he became regius professor of civil law at oxford university and a fellow of all souls college in 1989 having held chairs at edinburgh 1981 87 and briefly at southampton before that he was a tutorial fellow of brasenose college oxford 1971 81 a strong law college to which he remained very close and taught at university college london he was elected a fellow of the british academy in 1989 and an honorary fellow of trinity college oxford his undergraduate college in 1994 he was made an honorary queen counsel in 1995 and served as president of the society of legal scholars in 2002 03 he lectured and taught throughout the commonwealth and in europe the guardian he became regius professor of civil law at oxford university and a fellow of all souls college in 1989 having held chairs at edinburgh 1981 87 and briefly at southampton before that he was a tutorial fellow of brasenose college oxford 1971 81 a strong law college to which he remained very close and taught at university college london he was elected a fellow of the british academy in 1989 and an honorary fellow of trinity college oxford his undergraduate college in 1994 he was made an honorary queen counsel in 1995 and served as president of the society of legal scholars in 2002 03 he lectured and taught throughout the commonwealth and in europe your edit birks with robert goff and gareth jones was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years the guardian birks together with robert goff and gareth jones was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years your edit and so it continues including the lifting almost wholesale of this paragraph one example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in woolwich building society v inland revenue this held for the first time that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities are not entitled to them the reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a birks essay but possibly because the lawyers had adopted his arguments without attribution the judgments do not refer to the essay this was put right in the house of lords where lord goff described the essay as powerful the guardian one example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in woolwich building society v inland revenue in that case the courts synonymous with the guardian original this held for the first time in english law you add in english law that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities had no legal right to levy them again synonymous with the original the reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a birks essay but the judgments did not refer to his writing some critics suggest this was because the lawyers adopted his arguments without attribution you move a subordinate clause from the middle of the sentence to the end varying the wording just slightly this was put right in the house of lords where lord goff described his writings the essay as powerful your edit you copy a bit more copyright material and at the end of the article even clumsily leave in peter brian herrenden birks academic lawyer born october 3 1941 died july 6 2004 disappointing editing from a highly educated member of the legal profession best wishes

it problematic using voisin memoirs as a source there are so many ludicrous and self contradictory statements there but charles voisin instructed a sign painter to put in large letters the names of our clientson the empennages of their aeroplanes our trade mark printed belowthis emblem was sufficiently modest in size not to be legible on the photographs of our machines it was a measure to get people to buy their aircraft in the hope that any glory gained by winning prizes would be gained by them not by voisin freeres it workrd only two well voisin is very bitter about the reception accorded farman what i cannot quite figure out is what to do with the wheeled undercarriage roll control sections which at present swamp the article and also repeat matter found in many other places

motive i just heard olly steeds quote some line of bull about these people all having been sacrificed to the gods i am not an expert but i think that ritual is a catch all for unimaginative archaeologists i have no doubt that one researching modern america would say coming uncommonly close to the truth that the gas chamber and the electric chair were also elaborate religious rituals but it would be interesting to hear more about whether anything is known here my bet would be that if you wanted to kill someone you would drop him in the bog and these people are just murder victims i wonder if there any way anyone will ever know more than that
what is that why this list or grid or anything is in article namespace it seems that it is not an article
what do you mean andreafox2 tito was not important how could you say such a thing do you know how many important people came to his funeral do you know that all of yugoslavia cried when tito croaked hahahaha it great that you have noticed that no in fact tito is nobody and nothing but a democidal totalitarian communist dictator to top it off he was a locksmith by trade probably learned to read shortly after the war he was a a puppet in regards to geopolitical relations between the east and west during the cold war years his legacy and his psychopathic bloodthirsty trail ended with his sick national experiment which will never ever ever ever return ever in the end if people did care they would realize that this entire article which direktor has a wn own on is a disgrace to the western world freedom and democracy

i agree with jaakobu i replaced the lead because i could not find one article where someone tried to hide another transliteration later in the article and after reviewing the page history i can only conclude that there is some goal to create a weight in one direction or the other by those seeking the removal of the transliteration i too would like to see some sourcing for the hand waving claim that it is an arabic word over and over again just because you repeat a claim over and over does not make it so that is merely proof by assertion
please see in regards to this incident unblock should be denied talk contribs
thank you again the passport picture had no problem in regards to the concern you raised above why delete that also the 22 sheduled languages have also been decided by earlier governments by the way india did not choose a national language in order to not piss off the 23 muslims that live here but that can not be proved however i since bharat ganrajya is a hindi word why is it even mentioned it then why not simply republic of india because hindi is important is many way official language used in govt ids and documents so if one has to write bharat ganrajya why not write it in its indigenous script too do not write it then bharat ganrajya has different names in the 800 languages spoken in india why write bharat ganrajya the hindi version only i hope you try to understand cheers to you too

well the accusation of vandalism remains unsupported by any attempt to justify it and the accusation that i said anything about sorting him out what does he think i am a 14 year old in the playground can be seen from the talk history to be pure fanciful invention if you believe that this editor has anything positive to add to the project perhaps you would like to steer him towards the straight and narrow

wikipedia miscellany for deletion user propaniac su hi i have just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at mfd a couple months ago and it was deleted tbh i do not remember what was there and i was just curious if you remembered the topic or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place i am not objecting to the deletion although i am kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting and to find out that wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace i mean that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in article space that i have tried to delete but that been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile but again i am not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place just wondering how it happened thanks for any light you can shed

hi i noticed you had changed section headings and such on talk gene wilder there really is no valid reason i could think of that would necessitate this in some cases certain sections of talk pages may be linked from another page for some reason and when the section titles are changed those links would no longer be helpful also many editors express concern when others refactor talk page content as discussed at wp tpoc thank you

i did not make a threat i said i am not going to block you and you do not need to apologize to me i was suggesting you apologize to the user whose edit you reverted in the link i gave you above that user asked me to block you since i am not going to do that because after talking it over i can see that your intentions are good it would not kill you to drop them a line to apologize for your mistake it does not cost you anything you will gain a lot more respect for apologizing than you will for refusing to i have taken more time with you than any editor has since you have been on wikipedia and certainly more time than you took with any of the ip addresses whose contributions you reverted but i do have other things to do like blocking actual vandals and i need you to understand that you cannot just remove the contributions of others without a solid reason i direct you once again to checkuser if you do not want to use it and insist on reverting valid edits your fate is in your hands talk
the original roc article this was written as such until the 1912 1949 article was created and everything pre 1949 was ported there without extreme controversy when this article was renamed as taiwan from are public of china the original stance by the admins was that this article was to talk about the republic of china as a whole with only the title to be renamed as taiwan however some people jumped ship and created the mainland roc article and ported everything there creating another roc as a whole article will be very controversial and to be honest people are tired of arguing for this and that you can try to write one but you will see a lot of hate coming from most of the community greens will argue roc taiwan reds will argue roc dead blues are just not there anymore to back you up 204 126 132 241

mass deletions and synopsis at this point i think it is important to discuss what constitutes excessive detail when it comes to a multi issue cross over event given that the storyline covers months of details and multiple points of view each seperate series we should come to a consensus on what should be included in the article and what should be left to the imagination or primary sources there also seems to be an effort on the parts of some editors to delete material without consensus so this is an attempt to find that consensus please chime in on your views of the organization structure and content of the article

attn editors i would like help reviewing this page for possible publication to wikipedia efforts were made towards neutrality by using only published citations particularly the first paragraph which was taken from allmusic guide and a list of other citations is below i am new to wiki so your assistance would be greatly appreciated
sure can say that again this is really smart there an entry saying someone blanked a page how clever but i am using this ip and i certainly did not blank any page wiki omniscient henchmen suggest registering an account it no longer a wiki then is it registering an account is not a good idea anyway far better is to stop blocking ips like this most people are on non static ips anyway so the idea is last millennium what you really need is to filter out the junk that gets people pissed off in the first place if wikipedia had any quality at all and not just a bunch of do nothings who patrol and feel tough about it and there would not be any vandalism at all people would be proud and respectful of the place but that not going to happen and we all know it the middle echelon at wikipedia have long ago taken it to the dogs how the new money raising campaign going
i happen to know about the character how is that vandalism

hi alphachimp i have a question for you i reverted some previous changes on some pictures of ff8 articles and that ticked off some people although i did not mean to i still want to keep them through what do i do eileen
sockpuppet or not which i do not see any sockpuppet tags on its still not an excuse for uncivil behaviour there is no excuse for uncivil behaviour of course it does not have sockpuppet tags on it brand new created for the sole purpose of vandalization it somebody breaking the rules and btw i was not being uncivil it was not a threat it was a very specific promise of how i would follow up with his continued disruption and i will you are being uncivil by continuing to harrass me and also unreasonable in thinking somehow a sockpuppet created for the sole intention of vandalization actually can have its feelings hurt this is what i would at this point consider the end of the discussion anything else would be a sign of uncivility i am not being remotely uncivil i left a message and asked you not to be you have now continued your uncivil behaviour by blanking warnings from your talk page promise or threat amounts to the same uncivil behaviour there was no reason to threaten them with an ip ban you are attacking me with warnings and attempting to set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner so you can complain about me probably to subvert the vote for deletion against the michael everson article you responded to my warning the vandal about his vandalism so quickly it raises my suspicion that it may be in retaliation for my very quick reversion of the vandalism that occured at the afd you are behaving in such a manner that seems to be attempting to troll me by continued action after being warned to leave me alone i disagree with you plainly that i behaved uncivily it is not required of me to agree with you i also consider your warning of me behaving uncivily a personal attack and am removing it if you want to find an arbitrator for arguing over nothing that is directly your next step as per the arbitration guidelines leaving a warning template for obviously uncivil behaviour is not uncivil otherwise no one could leave them retaliating with that template however is uncivil i have pointed out the issue with your behaviour you can correct it or not but launching a personal attack against me wo not help you as for the afd you are involved in i could care less i have no interest in it and again i will remind you you are in charge of how you behave and respond set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner if you behave uncivily its your fault no one else no one has held a gun to your head to force you to act in the manner you are

you have confused something here my only edit to the article was to remove the afd tag after closing its articles for deletion debate please see the edit history of the article when you look at such an edit history you can see exactly which actions were taken by different editors by comparing different versions of the article to see what my edit was you would check the box just prior to my edit as well as the box next to my edit and then click compare selected versions by doing so you would see the actual change i made to the article which you have not reverted i believe the edits you are referring to were made by on a separate note the current introduction is just about impenetrable and needs a substantial rewrite

cathel one thing you ignore and one night in hackney has never been able to explain is why bobby sands and other irish republicans are the only people with pages on wikipedia where this rule applies to they are the only pages where factual informaiton is being left out cathel you cannot deny that one night in hacknkey is targeting irish republican catholics you do not see him removing jewish categories from any other pages and there are many people in jewish categories who are not notable for being jewish so then why does this rule only apply to irish republican catholics and of course the church will condemn any form of violence mainstream muslims leaders also condemn terrorism does not mean islamic terrorists should not be in muslim categories by your logic yes so if i start removing terrorists from muslim categories i can count on you to back me up when a person readds the categories

you are referring to a book written 30 years ago after that i could not find anything else that qualifies as source in reality santilli went on to develop his own foundation and a publicly traded company while at the same time getting his work out there and published in peer reviewed journals and also self published this is the greatness of america there is room for everybody and his story is a good example in regard to kook ideas fringe ideas opposition from peers i suggest that you all wake up and follow the money trail on april 29 as they were getting ready to launch the space shuttle enedeavor national public radio had a piece about the alpha magnetic spectrometer or ams which was going to be carried into space by the shuttle this instrument that cost to you and me and to all taxpayers 2 billions of dollars is supposed to look for antimatter created in the big band this project was proposed by nobel prize physicist samuel ting many years ago it was controversial and several time congress tried to cancel the program but could not overcome the lobbying by all the scientists involved in the project in the same piece npr interviewed professor gregory tarle a physics professor who said this project was a tremendous expenditure of money that was not justified while the ams was originally planned to search for primordial antimatter recent research show that that there is no way that it will find any this physicist is from the university of michigan and i am sure people working with ting or other scientists who were on the salary to built the machine considered this man a kook a subversive and tried to discredit him in any way do you think that if he now goes to the lab where the machine is built he is going to get a job do you think that when you go to a professor who is the recipient of a grant on a specfic subject and you tell him that the subject he is studying has some alternatives and that he is basically studying an old theory and there are alternative ones that professor will just tell you that you are great and that you deserve a piece of the pie do not you admit the possibility that he is going to discredit you and send your work to a friend who is going to write a report and do you think that that report is going to be in support of the new alternative so his friend loses his grant i am not sourcing this since it is a discussion on a different subject and it is very easy to find on the npr site however it is very pertinent to the discussion about santilli saying that he was opposed that is a normal event and if santilli talked about this opposition is he a kook and a fringe and should he publicly disparaged forgot you may not like npr so my whole discussion is disqualified scuranova

strongly opposed merge as i explained above these are completely different subjects and the fact that the green transport is not well developed does not justified the merger the key difference is that green transport is a concept wording developed by the environmental groups while sustainable transport is a mainstream concept in transport engineering and economics and obviously they overlap as green transport is a subset of sustainable transport but some concepts are defined by the environmental ideology rather than pure economics and engineering and these not necessarily agree

some things i would like to mention the reason japan is not listed as a potential superpower is because they lack the ability to project military power throughout the world which is one of the key aspects of being a superpower they have no nuclear arsenal and according to their own constitution they are not allowed to use their military for anything other than defending their own country there is far more to being a superpower than having a strong economy but even then their economy has been seeing stagnation as of late whereas india china and russia have been seeing economic growth of 8 11 over the past few years as for russia and india being failed states that not true either just look at this list neither country is listed and perhaps you saw those other links i posted about poverty and education russia has far less poverty and is far better educated than china you grouping russia in with india in terms of poverty and education just makes no sense at all when you look at real world statistics and real facts so i hope you did not take my reverts the wrong way but as i have shown you your edits do not reflect common sense as you put it and they do not reflect the real world please in the future just use the discussion page before making controversial changes based on your point of view and we can avoid this whole mess force is usually not the best way to get what you want here on wikipedia

funny smashthestate was not one of them
no we only categorize standard biographical information year of birth death religious affiliation national identity etc and those things that are related to what makes the subject notable in graham case his masonic credentials are not what make him notable it does not really matter what graham may have valued or what he was proud of what matters is what sources such as historians think is of value if there are sources that discuss his masonic credentials and talk about how they affected graham life and his achievements then he would be categorized the truth is being a 32nd degree mason is not that noteworthy any 3rd degree mason can become one all it takes is paying an initiation fee and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play in fact you do not even have to take the 4th 31st degrees as a prerequisite you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd now if graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service as for being elected master of a lodge even that is not that notable most lodges elect a new master every year and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the us alone this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of past masters in the us in smaller lodges it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as master now if graham had been elected grand master of an entire masonic jurisdiction things would be different state or national level masonic office is somewhat notable there are only hundreds and not thousands each year and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization all that said both facts are interesting bits of biographical trivia and probably should be mentioned in passing the place to do so is in the main body of the text

vandalism by user sitush you have removed large chunks of materiel from the singahi article on spurious grounds as an independent wikepedia investigator i have historically examined several of your edits and there seems a certian lack of integrity to your character i use harsh words here take for instance and one can not hide anything in wikipedia the singhai article you said you did not believe the cited sources and removed large parts of the article well the article was cited with proper academic rigor and its up to you now to go into the sources i have done so and verified the sources of this article now the question remains why you chose to edit this article and what did you not like about it i suspect and i need to built a case via an investigation on all your wikipedia edits is that you are following a political agenda and would like to see a distortion of indian history the sang parivar or rss also follows this agenda and several users and administrators have been banned from wikipedia after their peers investigated the guardians of the articles in wikipedia are the users themselves along with the transparency of all edits which undergo a peer review i am sorry sitush you have failed this peer review moreover i suspect the accolades and the praise on your user page is similariry manufactured by yourself and your friends that a serious case of not assuming wp goodfaith calling good faith edits vandalism is not appreciated around here let talk i think i am going to call myself a independent wikipedia investigator i like that title although guardians of the articles is also pretty sweet read talk thank you for the laugh whenever i see your name i will think guardian of the articles the original post has been added to the talk yes i have been also examining the work of sitush and he has been a great pain in the for those editors who are trying to do useful work writing well cited academic articles sitush the wikipedia community has lost patience in you i first felt sorry for you but after looking at your various edits i feel you have only brought this on yourself this public shaming and criticism please learn from your more academically experienced wikipedia peers preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs

sorry mate sorry about that should of thought about a few things than just place that bunch of information in
a few things i wanted to say i do not understand why everyone thinks cockney can only be spoken on the east end it seems to be much more of a working or lower class accent found all over london maybe not all over but certainly not just the east end if you listen to sound clip for example you will hear a man from peckham peckham is not in the east end instead it is in south london and yet he is more cockney than anyone i have heard in my life it says in this article as well that most characters on the sitcom only fools and horses are cockneys and yet that takes place where else but in peckham this article also says that snatch contains cockney accents and yet jason statham who plays one of the main characters in that film and seems to speak with one of those accents is actually from sydenham in south east london what are some differences between the so called south london south of the thames accent and north london accent i just find it annoying that locals claim to be able hear differences between the two and yet they never can describe those differences when asked it makes one doubt whether such differences even exist it kind of like how new yorkers claim to be able to distinguish between bronx accents and brooklyn accents irish new york accents and italian new york accents etc but when asked what those differences are they cannot give you an answer it all b s if you ask me

and you have a point in return and a dilemma with which to grapple but to my mind it still does not justify the excess length especially given the level of detail present in one section as opposed to the others i might also suggest that one newspaper article is proof of nothing despite some rather emphatic insistence it is newspapers have editorial standards and biases of their own consequently we are left to determine the veracity of individual quotes and have no way of knowing evidence was omitted from the article in order to paint a specific picture the implication i draw from earlier comments is that what irvine says is not true unless he admitting he lied and everyone else is truthful yet even a cursory glance through the comments accompanying the article and associated material in the same publication indicates one of the other major parties involved has a pretty dicey history herself i would say hanging the word proof on any of what you have is pretty questionable absent a second reliable source of evidence i e not another entity that has picked up and recycled the original source article

course i did then moments later notified you i still cant work out why you are so angry when this should be about doing whats best for wikipedia and the rfa is going really well and thats what really counts i have apologised and this isnt acceptable to you so as far as im concerned you can take your bad attitude elsewhere glen do not talk to me like that please i have made no personal attacks on you no profane language only made a very well put arguement indeed i am angry but i am not expressing it in my writings to you do angry uncivil people say indeed i doubt it i made abundantly clear i wanted to nom i thoguht you understood that as you did say on riana talk page that that was fine just because she asked you did not mean you had to do it but becasue you actually really wanted to you gave no thought to if it would hurt my feelings went ahead with the nomination make no mistake i am angry with riana as well as she also knew my intentions you posts on sarah talk was intriguing as well as you state that i created 2 more rfa pages for riana immediately after the declined one i only created one that was 2 months later so do not mistake internal anger external calmness with anthing else you both hurt my feelings as i made several posts about how i wanted to nom or at least co nom riana could have waited as i am not on here 24 7 as i too have a life to live i would have easily waited another day for someone who not only nominated me first but was also my friend before superimposing on the rfa page but again i think you riana have different standards to mine had no problem hurting another feelings ahem i have no problems letting you guys nominate her first this is what you call no problems glen yeah but you said after that that it was in fact fine besides i only said that because you were pushing that you wanted to nominate i never thought you would be so cruel as to not actually let me nominate but anyway it does not matter now i am trying to distance myself from the situation ouch mates i am sorry this is all my fault i forgot to include nomination statement as well i have been incredibly busy and not really giving my full attention to the rfa because i have a dad dying in hospital so if anything is amiss it all my fault please do not blame glen or sarah spawn man i have just had more important things on my mind than rfa i am trying to have a look from time to time though sorry about the trouble glen i will leave spawn man a message on his talk _dzasta do not bother riana i am not responding to anyone right now thanks for the thought glen do not worry i am not gonna make a fuss about it on wiki but i just thought you guys needed something to excuse my neglect anyway thanks again _dzasta

well then it asserts that they were all fake it is no more possible to provide evidence of a fake than it is of santa claus the saddam claim makes it clear what the problem is people make this stuff up any evidence that saddam son had one much less used it all sorts of bullshit claims have been made about saddam i notice few people have even tried to prove them how can i present evidence of a fake if they are all fake i cannot prove santa claus does not exist either the onus of proof in an encyclopedia ought to be on the people making a positive claim and if no one can find evidence of its existence it ought to go the same way there is no page on the existence of unicorns the spikes thing is clear an ex posto rationalisation as there are no existing models and probably never were and what evidence there is is that the spikes did not move people for some reason want to believe this is true and are very very resistent to the truth wikipedia should not be in the business of peddling half baked urban legends it ought to go entirely but failing that it ought to be modified until such time someone can provide evidence of its existence which i suspect no one will

in addition corwin claim that pershing was never really promoted to the rank of general of the armies is i hate to say it absolutely ludicrous every military text book in existence that mentions pershing speaks of him holding this rank his service record has documentation of this rank and check out this link with at least five separate statements that pershing was a general of the armies i can perhaps imagine that we cant find the actual paper wilson signed promoting pershing it might have been destroyed in the national personnel records center fire but pershing was obviously a general of the armies on that point there can be absolutely no doubt

singles sections hi i noticed you have been adding singles sections to album articles it may be better not to do this because the article is likely to mention the singles elsewhere for example you recently added a singles section to the music of the sun article which already stated music of the sun includes the singles pon de replay if it lovin that you want and let me another reason not to do this is that prose should be used instead of lists wherever possible also please remember to cite reliable verifiable sources for your edits particularly those involving the addition and changing of information about future events e g forthcoming single releases thanks

when i say insecurity i mean as a result of the prc continued emphasis on liberating taiwan and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in beijing today could afford to be seen as having lost taiwan the fact that taiwan has never been part of the prc not withstanding remember that taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the ccp and the kmt before world war ii with mao even being quoted in the 30 as supporting taiwan independence from japan why taiwan and not mongolia well politics basically the prc need to maintain good relations with the soviet union at the time and to drum up support against western imperialism and cks taipei regime cks of course also recognized mongolia in the 20 or 30 to try to woo soviet support but revoked it ha ha after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the soviets anymore today cks and mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain

disscussions with dmacks oth have understanding difficulty onemadscientist talk i am talking about your behavior we are all responsible for what we ourselves do even if we feel provoked by others it a great test of one strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations your edits were explicitly written to insult a person rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions and you even said you were trying to undo your previous steps towards repairing the destructive atmosphere here that all forbidden period no but he said or i am just proving i was right all along what are your personal intents for being a wikipedia editor if it to improve wikipedia articles then go do so now and stop wasting everyone time with discussions about your previous battles if it is anything else including trying to school others in morality or your sense of religious obligation no this website it not for you dmacks talk dmacks well i am talking about your and plasmic physics behavior and responsibility around here and maybe this website it not for you you would do well take your own advice dmacks is there not a word for describing the lack of following one own advice rules which i have been condemned for using oh yes now i remember it is hypocrite and i was beginning to think you had realized your errors in regards to your application of your obligations as a wikipedia morality code enforcer and understood my very significant and valid arguments specifically for now in regards to your choice and the actual definition of what exactly constitutes a personal attack around here and the objectivity by which it is applied and the selective abuse of its application by you in particular you are now bringing up the very important point that i would have very much desired to take up with you in your absence i am sorry i mistook your silence for understanding on your behalf i contend that you have failed miserably in the great test of one strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations and should have known better given your display of apparent authority i contend that in this issue with plasmic physics which you had been following from the start at least that after my initial transgressions and subsequent overly profuse apologies was being very polite and civil i was then was the subject of an obvious personal attack from plasmic physics who was my initial accuser in the very first instance again not taking ones own advice his remarks which obviously were explicitly written to insult a person me rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions and contained no factual justification my response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing with civil english words the facts in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me in my attempt to obtain an apology from him while lacking any support against his attack you decided to label me the transgressor but not him you appear to be very negligent and biased acting in your appointed role here to say the least if not totally malicious i contend that your obviously biased behavior should preclude you from further involvement in any moral code violation disciplinary action let alone this specific one this is for starters in addressing your negative comments about me i hope i have i made this point clear to you now onemadscientist talk i would appreciate and deserve an apology from both of you but i can see that is unlikely if not please do not waste my time any longer with your attempts at trying justify either your or plasma physics transgressions toward me or bother me any longer about this issue and i shall leave you alone and seek others here who deserve my considerate attention it appears that you two obviously should get along well together
5 october 2012 utc i first sent you message then after that created a section regarding my edit in the talk page and deleted the content once again after which i continued to receive warnings and reinstatements of the removed content at which point i decided to escalate the conversation to the specific user talk page if there is any issue related to the timestamp of the section i created in the article talk page i edited the post with the signature button at a later time because i had forgotten to when i initially created the section i was not intending to create any edit wars and my direct assertion to another user was only because my edit and talk page section were being overlooked

ok where are we 1 i have presented sourced evidence from official government websites mostly foreign ministries or equivalent that according to the governments of the uk france and italy the eu is a member 2 i have prsented sourced evidence from individual g8 websites created by respective governments that the eu is a member nowhere is there any official statement that the eu is not a member some people are arguing that when it says the eu joined the g8 the word join has some special meaning and they must therefore accept that canada is not a member becasue i have shown the sentence where it says that both canada and the eu joined 3 i have pointed out that most of the official g8 websites are quoting from the same source so the contentious phrasing recure 4 lucy marie quotes the sentence the european union is represented at the g8 by the president of the european commission and by the leader of the country that holds the eu presidency of course it is this sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their head of state government and is needed simply because the eu does not have a head of state government it does not mean anything else 5 lucy marie further quotes the eu does not take part in g8 political discussions of course it does not it would be quite wrong for the president of the commission to do this since the eu cannot have a single view on these issues being an association of many countries some of which are represented in the g8 anyway 6 nowhere is there a source saying that the eu is not a member i know you cannot prove a negative but more significantly there is no source to say that the eu has partial membership or restricted access or observer status or anything other than full membership if such exists it should have been presented by now

i can only apologise for my prior tone please accept my heartfelt apologies i am sure neither of us wants those discretionary sanctions slapped on me you seem to be under the impression i feel my actual purpose has been misunderstood for it was not my intention to claim it was your responsibility to make the corrections you deemed necessary if you do not want to make an edit do not wikipedia participation is entirely voluntary after all what i had meant to do as i thought was clear was infer incorrectly i am told the depth of your concern from your inaction i do not think 972mag is you are entitled to your opinion of 972 of course but the root source was the twitter feed of ofir gendelman i always try to learn from my mistakes and so i will make sure next time to put a url to the root source to save us both some typing y ou used ardonic where the source uses arcastic the source only one i see two the first of which describes it as a mocking letter i simply felt the word took into account the aggregate description of the letter content i felt this complaint was unwarranted but it was dutifully attended to without reflection by jabotito48 to his credit his actions indicate that he too disagrees with your implied view that someone only cedes responsibility for a section of an article when they have written strictly less than or equal to fifty percent of its content the source you used as a ref for the netanyahu statement indeed upon inspection it appears i cited the wrong times of israel article i thank you sincerely for bringing the mistake to my attention and it has been dealt with inn is generally an unacceptable source however for something so small i could not see the harm i am forced to concede one point it a simple matter of the article saying what the source says for some reason my instinctive reaction is to immediately attempt to contradict you on this occasion i should have agreed with you w e are at 3 0 at this point thus the tag may be there for quite a while
yeah i agree page removal its poor anyway

in the article pink colour they altered the sentence to say crying also known as sobbing wailing weeping bawling or blubbering is shedding tears as a response to an emotional state in humans they changed it from also called to known as to call attention to the word their personal talk page is covered with references to death and mentioned in context with colours they were warned prior to this about wp unbroken why did they specifically add europe to this article and remove australia star fox assault had other vandalism from different editors generally they are making a series of edits which is semi constructive trolling taking into account the death images and baiting combined with that and their identification of their personal talk page as an article a warning for disruptive editing was the most apt warning i could find

welcome to wikipedia thank you for your contributions you may benefit from following some of the links below which will help you get the most out of wikipedia
architects act 1977 thanks for your intervention on this page i agree you are probably right to remove the lengthy footnote but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse which is i imagine the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place i therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page for you never know a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there the very distinction i hope you will agree that marks an encyclopaedia which should be an extensive knowledge resource apart from a penny guide book a few points however you have left some external links blair kelly which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article there is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter the bullet point statements are accurate and in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages and as to technology if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages then you are a lot cleverer than i am your criticism is a little disparaging it may of course be both accurate and justified but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude perhaps it needs charity may i suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia which i admire but am no part of which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half baked detraction

wikipedia cannot interpret primary source material per wp rs if steorn really wants some mainstream media coverage that can be used in the article they could give a prototype of the machine to eric ash etc and ask for an independent test report anyone from steorn listening here talk to me
no the only thing bringing people to this wikipedia article was the conspiracy information and back story information the information which you just completely blanked which was already here you blanked the information i did not even add nothing on this article is even informative at all now if i wanted a poorly detailed episode list i could go to the youtube playlist and get an accurate and detailed description of every episode if the article is going to stay in the state that it is in then i am all for wp deletion in that case because the article now provides nothing useful at all also i just showed you how notable it is outside of primary sources if it was not then there would not be so many google results of people talking about it but by your standards nobody can even prove that and if you cannot look past that for a second and see why this information is useful to the article in order to help verify it in the process then i do not know how you call yourself a wikipedia contributor 72 72 240 141

i dont quite follow your point about transferring something to your sandbox as a reason for undoing my edit and i have to say i find it hard to believe that an editor with 17 000 edits would be unaware of how to easily revert an edit indeed that was one way or another exactly the action you performed to the article in question it can be disappointing when you have put work in that you were unaware ran contrary to a content policy but try not to get exasperated again kudos on your fine contributions to wikipedia thanks talk

oppose merging in great basin desert this is listed as one of the major deserts while the article is smallish at this point it is well enough developed to stand on its own however if some merging occurs i expect that there will be some movement of material if anything is merged the categories should probably remain on the redirects for accuracy in the titles as they appear in the categories

it was speedily deleted three times twice for not being notable which i do not think was really appropriate as a speedy deletion but whatever and the third time for being a copyright violation of this bachcell i would say a couple of things here 1 do not create articles by possibly violating copyrights from other web sites 2 cheeky comments like other terrorism er whatever cases are borderline disruptive you have made it crystal clear you think the fort hood shooting is terrorism and it terrific that you are a fan of the nine eleven finding answers foundation but neither of those things have anything to do with writing this encyclopedia article and this talk page is not remotely the place to tell editors about an article you wrote that needs watching to make sure nobody speedy delete or afd it for no reason talk contribs

03 15 utc 20 mar 08 can you elaborate squeak in your add of the blp you wrote tag for blp as this article has issues can you elaborate specifically what some of those issues are preferably without commentary in in a short concise bulleted list that way we can together address those concerns i agree that per the blp page this could fall under its purview to a small extent my concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes read deletions based on idontlikeit with the blp as their smokescreen justification i do not think that your intent but at some point it could happen from another i am hoping we all can mitigate that possibility now thanks in advance for clarifying
moreover i think that the majority of the introductory paragraphs can be put into a new section entitled history of composition similar to the one in the rigoletto article

huh are you saying not adding critiques which are opinions would make the article opinionated thus pov i do not get it also i said positive feedback as in positive critiques or evaluations a feedback is a critique his founding a nation is not an evaluation however it happened whether or not somebody had an opinion about it you cannot un critique that same goes for other things you mentioned as being positive they are not critiques or evaluations they happened the tree did fall in the forest even if nobody heard it for your critique and i can make counter critiques and claims that say there are kurds who love ataturk and that would undo your claims do you understand you are expressing the opinions of certain people that pov you can do that on a blog or something not here i know you understand so let move on and let stop wasting time on this it silly

this is the lead as it currently reads lance edward armstrong born lance edward gunderson september 18 1971 is an american former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete he won the tour de france seven consecutive times 1999 2005 but was stripped of those titles by the u s anti doping agency usada and banned from cycling in 2012 we have basically two things to consider whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis i would say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1 there is now a consensus in the world at large that armstrong did not properly win the tour de france ever and since 2 as far as official racing he is concerned he did not win the tour de france at all it would be far more accurate to say that armstrong was once considered to have won the tour de france seven times this state of affairs is very unlikely to change as for emphasis at this point armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else as time passes this is bound to intensify since it is now obvious that armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else

it might be useful for you to read this wp con note the following statement consensus is wikipedia fundamental model for editorial decision making what that means is that if several editors say they do not agree with something that carries weight three editors have expressed concerns about the material you are trying to add to the article they agree that there are problems with it you need to respect that consensus

nice additions to the instrument articles rackett is sure a weird beast i have played with one occasionally i do not do double reeds but i had to toy with it anyway by the way when modifying entries like sackbutt you should check first to see if it automatically goes to sackbut as it does in which case there not much reason to change the spelling considering how many spellings there are for sackbut i assume you are a double reed player with a fondness for renaissance horns
i did try to assume good faith to begin with here but the users history of wikilawyering as listed above culminating with the proof in the creation of m i a that their desperation to delete rename this album is purely rooted in the fact that the article could possibly be confused with an article they have an interest in caused me to lose it ironically changing the title of this article to mia will immediately cause separate confusion with another band called mia

it definitely is an interesting addition to the article the only question is whether you can really justify fair use in this case on the other hand i am not sure if you can really assert copyright over plain text pnas copyright policy on submissions suggests that unlike many other journals pnas does not demand that you sign over copyright the question then is whether the copyright belongs to fte or to nick matzke i would suggest sending nick and email and seeing if he will release the figure under a suitable copyleft license i clearly see it as a valuable addition to the article one that helps the reader appreciation of the topic

two birds one stone dear 206 186 8 130 i have been quite content to leave dyukov described as a historian novosti the state news agency trots out to dispute baltic lies about history one of several of my edits deleted each replaced by a more strident defense of dyukov credentials given dyukov command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film he already commands far too much space devoted to his views however since english speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see dyukov quite often on russia today novosti version of cnn or the bbc news i am supportive of leaving his commentary in other editors have mass deleted it dyukov spokesmanship as a historian specializing in soviet history and in debunking in particular baltic myths he uses stronger words in his novosti interviews is notable whether i like it or not however his pov and role in the official russian not independent media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended as for my principles they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately it obviously simpler to delete undiscussed pov anonymous ip edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality but whether you register or not whether you choose to reveal yourself or not any edit that portrays dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally pov your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt i will be happy to oblige writing that dyukov is a professional historian here and that he is not should be discussed elsewhere amounts to nothing but asking the editors here to ignore facts and to lie under the pretext of npov
that a big picture the giant picture should be sized down a bit

exactly right vandalism manifesto pass to all wikians vandalism is good vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm vandals do their thing all over wiki 24 7 from frustration and hatred because incompetent editors who have no skills no degrees no expertise usually no names have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others vandalism is a good and natural response to no lifers as in get a life who do 7000 edits 10 000 edits a year and who have actual watch lists of 1 300 or more and are proud of it these jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized over and over as long as they are in effect vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop vandals keep no life editors admins bureaucrats and stewards honest or at least busy reverting the reverts they get on their own pages vandalism is good it helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns the culture of wikipedia is very very sick and vandals are needed to cull the herd support your local vandal vandal god
thank you for your reply your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me perhaps users such as blixx are good friends of yours given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them i find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing all because i complained about my treatment lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen you just do not like it when i diagree with a point of view are you following the orders of blixx and co yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me they have called me a nasty piece of work an islamist haddad puppet etc have you even warned them i think not so its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when i criticise blixx and co i get punished one rule for one and one rule for another eh thank you for explaining what the word contraversial means to me maybe you can explain the meaning of another word for me hypocrite i want to end by apologising for any offence caused but you have to understand my frustation at being treated this way
oppose have not we been over this already
well first i reject the whole suitable for a general encyclopedia argument because it just not relevant wikipedia is more than that because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias size is irrelevant i have got a half terabyte external usb drive on the linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback well cryptonomicon at least assuming good bitonal tiff document images that will hold 5 million scanned pages assuming moderately compact text files palmos reader format that jumps to 250 million pages printing costs are also irrelevant since it not printed as are writing costs monetary and temporal as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size so it back to first principles the definition of encyclopedia is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics usually in alphabetical arrangement covering all branches of knowledge or less commonly all aspects of one subject dictionary com unabridged v 1 1 since wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas then i truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible as far as sysadmin topics go wikipedia failed me this week if the article on domain name system had even so much as a link to resolv conf i could have save myself a lot of digging when i set up that linux system in fact i will probably do just that along with showing the file format of resolv conf to that article now that i have figured it out why because it useful information that i needed and failed to find when i looked for it it not quite narrating the process but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the dns process to describe the steps taken by each part and one of those steps would be the client checks the list of dns servers see resolv conf etc to determine which name server to consult that all i would have needed to find the information i needed to solve my problem as jimmy wales said our goal is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions that my guiding principle when i work on wikipedia and i feel that the accurizing article fits that perfectly

never mond re the quotes you are correct in that it is better to move it into the body i have deleted the unreliable quote and moved the holocaust quote to the body of the text
again i feel obligated to remind people that things like countries or capital cities do not come into being solely upon declarations and recognitions this is only one aspect and not necessarily the most important the fact that countries tell israel we do not like the fact that you maintain your capital in jerusalem or move your capital to tel aviv does not make jerusalem less of an israeli capital from the factual point of view it is still where you would find the israeli center of government furthermore it is incorrect to say that most countries recognized jerusalem as a palestinian occupied territory the uk for example like many other countries maintains that jerusalem cannot be said to belong to any country for the time being the eu recently published a vision in which jerusalem is the capital of both israel and a future palestinian state the pa itself recently published a plan the fayyad plan in which it explicitly stated that east jerusalem and not all of the city should become the palestinian capital

from depleted uranium in urine of soldiers by the wise uranium project is du more hazardous than natural uranium since it contains contaminants such as uranium 236 plutonium 239 etc no depleted uranium used for bullets has been found to contain trace amounts of artificial radionuclides such as uranium 236 neptunium 237 and plutonium 239 the presence of these radionuclides can be explained by contamination from recycling of spent fuel introduced in the manufacturing process for details see diehl 2002 the radiation dose from exposure to such contaminated du is only a fraction of a percent higher than from pure du and thus still is lower than from natural uranium for details see diehl 2001

blp continues to tout the idea of using these hydrinos in products like super good anti corrosion coatings for ships great in 20 years have they supplied any of this hydrino product to coating manufacturing if i understand correctly mills did not publicize hydrino hydrides until spring of 2004 that is less than 9 years ago also consider that in addition to this discovery they are also touting the more recent solid fuel hydrino reactor as well as the ciht fuel cell before all that was the discovery of plasma based systems it is easy to see why this might 20 years or more to develop or more simply have they done an experiment where they recover the water from their experiments that allegedly recover energy from water and keep using that water and notice as the build up hydrinos increases the ability of the water to supply energy declines they do not try to reform the water after taking the hydrogen out of it in the ciht cell design once the hydrogen is used the oxygen is incorporated in other oxygen species which serve various functions in the fuel cell the ability for the water to supply energy declines the moment that energy is extracted from them rendering them as non water there are no indications in the paper that recombination of two hydrinos with one atom of oxygen will form water or that further energy would be extracted by catalytic reaction of such water nor is any importance placed upon trying to measure the amount of such water as a separate item from normal h20 the interest here primarily is not the notion of recycling water for further extraction of energy but rather the interest here is to allow the electron of hydrogen atoms to fall to lower fractional orbitals below ground state and allow that energy to be harness through an electrochemical fuel cell via absorption of energy by ions expert sectioneer of wikipedia86 19 9 14 karma 19 9 14 talk my objection to the characterization of rowan as an a source of independent research on blp theories was at least partially based on this issue where is it that rowan showed a hint of independent thought about the experiments they did did they ask questions like this and do independent testing to try to ferret out answers or did they work as paid technicians that did exactly the experiments that blp paid them to run and only report their results after blp had approved the reports has blp ever done an experiment which proved that they could distinguish between water with hydrinos and water that does not have hydrinos to my knowledge mills has not made it clear that two hydrinos could combine with an oxygen atom and this is perhaps because the nature of them would be rather unclear at this time thus not justifying and publication of claims regarding that issue any questions specifically about this probably have no solid answers at this time so it would not be surprising if no information could be gathered that rowan scientists asking these sorts of questions because that would probably not be available until the questions have good answers blp is not the type that publishes a question that it does not have an answer to so it keeps mention of such to a minimum until better data can be gathered so answers to your questions are as far as i know are not publicized not publicized yes no as far as my view about whether or not rowan constitute independent research it not expert sectioneer of wikipedia86 19 9 14 karma 19 9 14 talk

1 allow me to start with this one even at the time the zionist leadership denounced the massacre israel has a history of first saying sorry and later making a full investigation to add to this at the time there was no real intention at letting the arabs think that jews are cute and nice people to remind you jerusalem was under seige and convoys were being shot at repeatedly both sides were involved in spreading that 250 died this does not negate the current general belief to the event which is very controvercial 2 there allways been israeli counter opinions that what is so great in democracy however they do not constitude the israelis the same way that people like walid shoebat does not constitude the palestinians if it a matter of semantics than i suggest we say the villager palestinians and the etzel and some isareli historions or something close personally i preffer my previous phrasing 3 i would be happy to hear who are these many israelis prefferably with serious links their conducted research method and accounts of the battle to validate that they are not groups with mainly arab israeli supporters

ooh thanks i have been avoiding article work at the mo as i cannot entirely trust that my judgment is 100 sound and i am happier with making unholy messes in talk space than in article space heh i think the fact that alexander ba thesis is quoted by other rs so alexander himself is considered to be reliable as in expert on the subject by others of similar distinction bearing in mind that his ma or at least large chunks of it is available reliably at cited by others i would think that would give sufficient oomph to his standing i cannot imagine any but the most obsessively nit picking and counter productive editors would then question alexander reliability at least i sincerely hope they would not i still have not done that painting yet though it becoming clearer in my mind day on day talk

scheinwerfermann sources can be brought from anywhere i brought one from samuel auguste tissot i could also bring from maimonides or schroeder that you chose to ignore or downplay the vast majority of sources quoted on wikipedia are from websites that are sketchy at best all that matters is how many and how dedicated people are to have their beliefs heard looking at your history you are obviously more dedicated to this website than i am so this page will remain the way you like it good luck because beyond wikipedia you probably do not have much going for you and house md wo not be on tv forever

red line i retire from this mediation and anything in relation with the article i have been witch hunted impunely and got a probably very unjust block i just cannot discuss in such conditions i have tried to be constructive pedagogic dialogant but all is useless so guess that in the end after a couple more editors have been displaced thulean will write the article alone of course i guess someone will come later and just nuke it because it ultra pov but in any case it will be someone else i am done with defending npov and the spirit of wikipedia in this article

i agree that the 20th century section is one sided because it seems to blame the indigenous palestinians for the conflict between palestinian arabs and the zionists and jewish settlers the mandate of palestine is the last time the region of palestine was entire actually bigger than at any other time in it history so the comparison of palestine to its political reality is valid
watch your step although allmusic says that the song became a hit on british and u s r b charts there is no evidence that in fact it was a hit joel whitburn top r b singles 1942 1995 covering the billboard r b chart in detail does not mention it at all it may have been mentioned in cash box but their charts seem to be unobtainable and though there may have been some r b charts published in some uk music magazines i cannot track any down so at best we should downplay the fact that it was a hit when actually we do not have the evidence that it was good record though

hello bergerie i applied those tags to your article because of some concerns i had with the language not being written neutrally and the lack of sources i did actually read your article we are pretty fast here so do not worry that those edits were automated i added the disputed tag because claims were being made without references but really references is the problem rather than tags so i have removed that particular tag finding external links to verify what is said in this article would go a long way towards improving it please let me know if you need any help user_talk flyingtoaster toaster

i am writing you because you have been disrupting wikipedia for the past week i am not sure if you even understand how your edits are disruptive so i will try to explain wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view this means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views your edits seem to be pushing a christian pov by removing certain articles from category jesus while adding others to category god i think the two clearest example of this is in this and this where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with jesus than in category jesus there is no reason to remove article just because they come from a muslim or jw or jewish point of view normally if you make an edit and someone else reverts it that means there is no consensus for your edit and therefore you should not make it again excessively re adding controversial content is considered edit warring and you can be blocked for this see wp 3rr what you need to do in these situations is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles that is not how wikipedia works i will also note that because of our npov policy i see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category jesus if you want to know more about wikipedia or if you want to discuss your changes feel free to ask me or request help from another user thanks talk

most of my comments are to greekboy as i have never edited w you i understand what you are saying but if you read what i wrote you will see that obviously her sales began decreasing even before there was a major impact from piracy and at that time many other artists were outselling her 100k sales and this is a fact you can search yourself along w that there are many other factors indicating her decline unlike x and paraxenes nylon and apago are considered to be commercial failures everything i said above was from newspapers and sources but obviously i wouldnt waste time putting it on my talk page b c again my comments were more directed to greekboy if you look it up her 2008 tour and the fab show were not very successful vandi tour for one beat vissi and there was actually a direct comparisson made between the s club and fab saying that the former success was very impressive when even vissi highly promoted show was not doing well if you think about it why would she invite rouvas to perform at athinon with her if she had fully supported the show the year before athinon is a big club and she on average only filled half of it according to forbes vissi got 26k euros last year and is getting 22k euros this year whereas rouvas got 18k last year and 20k this year the only person to increase to vima among others have cited paparizou as replacing vissi and vandi in the late 2000s and avopolis said vissi was trying to catch up to her do not get me wrong a paparizou or vandi fan i am not but unless you are completely blinded by being a fan you can see that in the past half decade paparizou has been the most culturally relevant female contemporary artist

as somewhat of an aside perhaps do not get me wrong i fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a jewish community should become a part of that community adopting its minhagim as his own this is the ruling according to beth yosef so when ashkenazim have settled there they should have become an integral part of the bukharan community as bukharans the real aside is the egregious nature of the establishment of the rishon letziyon ashkenazic chief rabbi ba aretz in contravention of halakha the reason i ask is because there seems to be a concentration on these individuals with apparently russified names if not originally ashkenazim themselves and the native bukharans apparently warrant no mention did the russian jews that seriously dominate the locals economically or did the bukharans russify their surnames in order to ingratiate themselves to their russian domineers that is the question i am asking talk

commenting on the evidence i would like to assert which were done by me and which were not i do not really know what to do or what i can do in these sort of situations so this is all i can offer right now evidence 1 3 4 and 5 were done by me and evidence 2 6 and 7 were not evidence 1 was me making an edit logged in to the page aang as i often make small edits to pages i am familiar with evidence 2 was not me as i do not use profanity evidence 3 was me logged in following the guidelines given to me as i faced a block message and the aforementioned guidelines were to paste a link on my page to remove the block now this is where i am a bit confused evidence 4 was me not logged in removing the welcome template that was on my user page but i did this a few weeks ago i believe that date listed is july 25 i removed it because i felt i no longer needed it and generally dislike it when my page is not edited by me which i assume led to evidence 5 evidence 5 was me logged in removing the unblocked message from my page and although i do not know what snarky is i hope it is not an insult i removed the template again because i generally dislike it when other people edit my page i understand that in this situation the edit to my page was to alert me of the unblock but i was assuming that message would be sent via inbox rather than a direct edit as for evidence 6 and 7 i am not user hermanthegerman66 and i would guess that ip 24 7 247 203 is also hermanthegerman66 but not at the library this is all i know to do right now hope it helps again apologies for any inconveniences

i have have in the travels here on wikipedia stumbled across some accounts that had been banned and in each case the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect if not improper might i be told i edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because in the state it was in it was jumbled and confusing obviously such things are imo also part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article are that was sought by other before me to be protected and to remain unchanged and part of the hidden note s message was put behind the word are in what is a separate hidden note a factor i saw as being counter productive but concerning which i also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two but few words were best imo in the part before the word are editor escapeorbit the person i understand is claiming that he was threatened now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been there escapeorbit in his talk page comment of 14 42 8 february 2010 wrote the facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while i believe it is doing the job intended http en wikipedia org w index php title talk queen_ band diff next oldid 342616216 however the same escapeorbit on january 20 2010 on the talk page for queen said the were are please note this is the same are in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily and have done so for years please see the full entry in context in the footnotes where you can see escapeorbit is saying this in response to another reader s encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a good article candidate i have put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it in the next few days i intend to nominate this article as a good article candidate however i feel work still needs to be done i will be making major improvements to the history segment of the article i feel we also need to develop a further reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article any contributions no matter how small would be sincerely appreciated let do freddie proud and get this to featured article status thestig i fear you will not get very far with a ga nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether queen still exist or not the were are in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily and have done so for years is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this escape orbit emphasis added or the page itself if you prefer http en wikipedia org wiki talk queen_ band nationality the hidden message was by escapeorbit s own words having no good effect we had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a ga candidate see footnotes with my edit of 16 43 7 february 2010 i included this edit summary expand existing important note with new footnote both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few words http en wikipedia org w index php title queen_ band diff 342506929 oldid 342389811 the important note i addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the are the purpose intent and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message escapeorbit s reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having what are in his opinion and interestingly enough i don t disagree here british subject matters use british english he writes about this phrasing precious to him that it is it is similar to a note that i frequently attach to british musical band articles emphasis added he is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect the problem is that he has posted frequently and so like a beloved child even though he says it s not working he isn t about to have anyone change his baby my changes to the hidden message are those words in bold are do not change this to is or were are is the correct uk primary compulsory education reading level

the image falls into the fair use category of the copyright exceptions as much as you want to be a copyright cop i have explained this to the other guy please read the guidelines it says a photo from a press agency e g ap unless the photo itself is the subject of sourced commentary in the article is unacceptable this provides an exception to the copy restriction it makes sense because how we can discuss the photo without seeing it by spending so much effort to hide this very key controversial photo you make yourself look very suspicious either as the sympathizer of the terrorists or something worse
sorry the three revert thing was my mistake for the record the issue it not whether the hat section should be included on the frank rossitano but whether there should be a discussion about it first or at the very least whether jeffrey o gustafson should provide an explanation that is actually an explanation and not a sarcastic put down on the talk page he wrote we are an encyclopedia i have linked the word for people who seem to forget what that is which surpasses any of my comments in everything but cleverness the indiscriminate collection of information section of wp not does not explicitly cover the issue as jeffrey o gustafson seems to believe and i believe there is definitely room for some pov again this could have been settled in a debate but jeffrey o gustafson was just too good for that he went on repeatedly deleting the section even after i added a big honkin notice that said not to for the time being you tell me what i was supposed to do

the problem is this closure now applied to only one category fails npov since according to our current state of consensus we can now tag anti semites in the us but we cannot tag them in france or spain that is exactly why the unified approach was proposed and accepted that a small group of editors attempted to override that in one category is improper because it leads to inconsistency and violation of neutral treatment of subjects thus i think those who want to change the longstanding consensus should start and frame the rfc and i ask you again to reconsider your close which also fwiw does not deal with biographies of dead people it also does not give any hints besides burden on who should be added to the category how anti semitic must a person be to merit inclusion
since the 17th amendment senators have represented the inhabitants of states not state governments since senators currently represent people it seems that one justification for an equal suffrage senate has been lost hamilton called states artificial entities since senators are now elected just like congressmen it seems doubtful than anyone can claim that senators are inherently wiser than congressmen either if senators do consider wider interests than congressmen it would seem the reasons for that are that senators represent larger and more diverse districts than congressmen and have six year terms user dinopup
at last to a finality i thank you for inviting me to this msn session to discuss on placing this compromise i am rather satsified with it while the oppossition led by this australian wikipedian grant65 cannot make satisfactory cases to distinguish iraq relevance from this article and why issues on korea should be preserved afterall the japanese acts of brutality against koreans are no more war crimes as anglo australian brutality against aboriginal australians that continues to this day their earliest british ancestors have settled australia by vice of terra nullius by meaning to fail to recognise the humanity of the native residents and have long mistreated the natives beyond the time of japan tyrannical grip on korea for this i put it to you come off it the aboriginal people of australian did not want and do not want to be part of the commonwealth and subjects of the british crown then by all means admit these acts of oppression against the aborigines fit within the complete defintion of your so called war crimes user bison augustus bison augustus

whatever was claimed on the show has to be mentioned in the article under the conspiracy theories section it is another conspiracy theory and although whoever removed my edit probably does not like that theory it yet another theory presented in a tv show that was produced by a former governor a show with high viewing ratings highest ever in trutv even if the claims of the episode are totally flase that what the show claimed within the scope of a conspiracy theory and therefore my paragraph should be resored in that section

i doubt it that the wikipedia introductory sentence warning about damaging a living person refers solely to go ahead say what you want as long as you cannot be caught from the legal view point you can write everything you wish i think wikipedia refers to some honor and honesty in talking about a living person who can be damaged in his her reputation and can suffer financial damage as well in his business so it is a question of honor and good editorial behavior in keeping with the truth you are pointing out the fact that the wikipedia article on ruggero santilli talks about fringe the difference between what that article says and what the oxyhydrogen article says is the difference between being fair and being recklessly mean and damaging this is my example steve is a photographer and some of his work is considered unprofessional childish and fringe physicist ruggero santilli who is proponent of ideas some of which have been considered fringe theories as it is in the article about ruggero santilli steve is an unprofessional photographer and he is an unprofessional fringe photographer fringe physicist ruggero santilli as in the oxyhydrogen article you are saying that santilli is clueless about electrolysis and therefore all his work is fringe how about his books in other subjects published by plenum springer verlag nuovo cimento did you read the you say that you want sources peer reviewed article and yet you do not like the international journal of hydrogen energy and cite calo as having negative comments how about the positive comments on santilli work by cloonan and trell in the same journal they are university professors you also do not like their universities do they have a poor reputation in your view how about santilli article in the american institute of physics aip also has a poor reputation i added verbatim to the oxyhydrogen article only what wikipedia has in the other article about santilli you are confusing people who sell stuff on tv and defraud customers from the work of reputable scientist who publish and work and are seeking the truth as much as you do and because of this you call fraud bogus fringe nut job bunching these two categories the tv fraud and the researchers together is not seeking the truth but being reckless and damaging especially when it was pointed out to you without calling you bogus nut fringe which could be justified by par condicio but i am not doing it for respect toward the readers and especially myself please do not go back to ethics scuranova
pete i have discussed this change you are saying i have not discussed it simply because you do not agree with my reasoning but i am tired of your attempts at stalling progress you will be reported if you revert again you are out of line with wikipedia policyreverting is only to be used in cases of blatant vandalism this is a constructive edit i have made my points already on the talk page and you ignore the good points and spin the ones that are easily spun so what am i supposed to do besides i do not have to have your permission to edit
edit warring you are both getting exactly the same message here i have fully protected two pages for 3 days i expect to see you discussing the changes on the talk pages during this time and attempting to come to some sort of consensus you are both technically in breach of the 3rr but i feel that it is best for the project to try and get you both discussing the changes you are trying to make i have watchlisted both the articles and if i see edit warring when the protection expires i am going to start blocking talk

removal of relevant external links hi i am writing in reference to your deletion of the links i added to the muscadine article i know that they are commercial sites but i thought it would be informative to include links to wineries producing this varietal in order to give wikipedia users outlets by which to learn more about the wine they were not intended to be spami have no stake in the profits of either winery is there a wikipedia regulation barring any external links containing commercial information if not i would like to either re add the links or agree on a criteria by which to judge whether commercial sites are appropriate best
your views of the editor position are distorted i do not mind using beevor or any other of the saint trinity mentioned by you above as far as using them follows wikipedia guideline stay with the facts mostly relics is not fact it a personal assessment you seem to push on authority of the trinity and willing to put into article anything just coz they mere say so i appreciate your effort in trying to find the factual basis behind their statements but when you realized that there is none the next step became too hard to take the source with criticism of the saint trinity research obviously does not exist coz nobody knows cares about them outside of english world and inside they seem to be taken with religious zeal the systemic bias by it nature can not be countered by giving weights since this is exactly the way it introduced blindly following guideline this is verifiable so shall be in while ignoring other stay with the facts will mere make wikipedia a collection of cliches and stereotypes popular among the prevailing editors this is reflected in details on the systemic bias page according to the guideline they should seek to improve articles by removing any examples of cultural bias that they encounter or making readers aware of them i have put the warning tag 84 52 101 196
my tourettes i have a very debilitating form of tourettes that makes it virtually impossible for me to leave the house due to the strong taboo attatched to one of my main verbal tic which is to let out a shout of the n word particularly when i get anxious or stressed due to this being an extremely taboo racial slur i feel unable to risk causing the kind of offense that i would by going out particularly when i could come across black people in daily life does anyone else have a particularly bad manifestation that makes a social life almost impossible i read about a poor man whose tic was related to child rape even worse than my own probably the problem is that the more taboo a word or phrase is and the earlier you pick it up the more it feeds into the tourettes i hope there is one day a cure because my life is miserable

rereading the section literally everything that boyd deleted that includes google groups citations are quotes from boyd himself the stuff that boyd denied for example the comment about burton richie claiming that boyd had an offer to buy the software with enough money left over to pay the pokerspot players and several hundred thousand for himself but boyd turned it down because he did not want to sign a standard noncompete you wo not get me out of the industry this easily was removed because of the issues with google groups while i disagree with the removal of that information i understand why there no reason to remove quotes directly attributed to boyd 68 81 192 142

i know the elements articles are a pita and involve a lot of defense from vandals and wp nor failers it not something i want to do otoh it a hard length to defend based on my non elements experience at rfpp i will dial it back and post a note on the talk page but ultimately i wo not be watching it so feel free to change it back if it becomes necessary as far as amount of vandalism is concerned here are my top indications that protection is needed see also wp rough extreme vandalism compare to the daily featured article but generally 5 unique ips in 24 hours or 3 4 unique ips per day over a slightly longer period sockpuppetry if protecting the article is easier than an ip rangeblock see pioneer courthouse square for an extreme example of this blp this one is obvious especially for unsourced fancruft usually this is for articles that are continually getting edit warred about the genre of a band or the rumor that someone won the latest season of survivor or pretty much any article related to wrestling mma the squishy stuff if an article is super stable compare diffs to cur no productive changes over last 100 edits or n months and the ips never have anything to contribute the last one is really the sticking point in the recent history of vanadium just looking to the 20th or so i see two repeat offender ips and a couple of random ones the repeat offenders should be warned and blocked for a short time if they have not been blocked before if it were was me i would feel comfortable semi protecting the article for 3 days maybe a week if i was frustrated finally generally the semi protection ramps up in length so a common pattern i use is 3 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 12 months then indefinite each time it should come unprotected and show big problems with ips as an aside i did not mean for this to be so long and apologies if you know all of this i tried to cast it as a personal opinion because it somewhat is and i am being so verbose because you are a new admin congrats of course and i am hoping it helps without coming off condescending heh that was a lot of rambling my apologies
i did what i could 99 of my problem with eggs is that i could not find one simple article or article section that described old volcano areas in general each area like this seems to have its own description and the only specific area that i needed for the article was mount etna it is all about places that resemble those regions growing conditions short of writing that article as well which would be interesting but i have been trying to tackle senecio and the article about the alkaloids which can and should be greatly improved i would rather keep spitting out new species pages and i am also looking for information for an article about paul klee senecio painting which are all related to the article about the alkaloids even the geology and soil science pages that i looked at do not have general information which is specific to these regions all i know is that they probably all grow potatoes but i do not know why and do not want to until this alkaloid mess is settled which i am almost euphoric to write i found a paper that i had been citing a citation of a citation to in the mid nineties in the middle of hauling volumes of plated food out to families and truckers it is that kind of euphoria one of the closure of a large i read somewhere that they read somewhere that a paper was written that cited a paper and what they really said was open end from previous studies can i blame it on the soil scientists

historians are incapable of second guessing hitler inner thoughts there may be some who believe that historians are capable of deciphering hitler inner thoughts i e hitler religion this is ignorance and stupidity they write things such as while historians such as ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock agree that hitler was anti christian they do not even provide quotes of ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock saying that hitler was anti christian all they are saying is trust us in our opinion the opinion of ian kershaw joachim fest and alan bullock is that hitler was anti christian a far better procedure is to rely on the opinion of hitler himself as to his religion

26 june 2009 utc silvester stallone is not a good example people are born not designed the government of the uk is not the government of the uk it is technically her majesty government but few people would argue that to describe it as the government of the uk was not accurate in the same way the queen is not head of state because she is much more than that she is the embodiment of the state in 1985 the now defunct united nations think tank is an accurate description of the body we can re arrange the sentence if you like 09 25

state and local politics i do not think that this sentence kansas was also at the center of brown v board of education of topeka a 1954 supreme court decision that banned racially segregated schools throughout the u s belongs in a paragraph describing how progressive kansas was that sentence which is an important fact negates what is being claimed in that paragraph it belongs in a paragraph dealing with how un progressive kansas is preceding unsigned comment added by 68 103 98 200 kansas city msa the kansas city msa is not a part of the state of kansas while some suburbs do spill into the state of kansas kansas citians pride themselves as being culturally independent from the state of kansas 60 percent of the msa is located in missouri the airport is in mo the tall buildings downtown is in mo the sports stadiums are in mo and overall the entire metro is anchored in missouri it is the second largest msa in missouri and is not part of kansas really at all this needs to be deleted preceding unsigned comment added by 70 246 231 23 the above comment was made by me i forgot to log in kansas city is anchored in missouri actually wichita has a larger msa in the state of kansas than kansas city would even if you counted the numbers joco adds about 500 thousand and the dotte is about 100 thousand according to the article on wichita there are 680 000 in their metro therefore wichita is larger in terms of metro strictly in ks even though kansas city msa is four times larger kansas city is a missouri metro not a kansas one

limerick response from cobaltbluetony this is not a democracy this is a serious attempt at creating a respectable encyclopedia we want everyone to contribute positively but we wo not tolerate nonsense abuse etc your edit carlsberg do not do cities but if they did then limerick would probably makes no sense and does not contribute to the encyclopedia value of the limerick article you are welcome to argue your case but seeing as you do not actually have one it might not help you any please re read the message i first posted here it was friendly and even tempered your response to me was not this is a community effort so please try to act as you would with people in real life again please take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia thanks the insert i made those make sense to all who know anything about limerick city in ireland i am a native of the city as are my parents and grandparents i have lived there for 28 years how can an american like you presume to judge whether this insert makes no sense at all when you know little if anything about limerick city let me enlighten you by saying it is the most popular beer in the city and us natives of the city commonly use the carlsberg beer catchphrase in everyday conversation when making humourous comments you make another presumption that i can argue a case but i do not have one which is a quasi oxymoron i would of thought that a neutral encyclopedia community administrator like yourself would know better than to such skewed presumptions of positivity let me give you some advice do not presume about other people point of view or about their motives it is insulting and an insult to your duty to this community thank you for your time

you are welcome that is a stretch if the only reason the picture is featured is that it exists it should be removed how is the reader to know that we are showing this image because we think its existence somehow proves something about societal attitudes and we do not even indicate what it proves also we have no idea if that picture was hidden away for hundreds of years the fact that it exists does not really prove anything images in the societal attitudes article should be about societal attutudes
guido hello blueboy i had a feeling this would happened after i created the account i work as a publicist and vanessa deleon is one of my clients she hired me to write and maintain this article the one and only i would create which explains my choice of user name most of my information is directly from her site and her personally and if her name is searched on the web most of this information is readily availble from a variety of sources although i do know her personally i do not think it should be reason for her information to be delted from wikipedia all information in the article is factual and by no means did i try to make it bias i would like to keep this page and would love feedback on how i could do so thank you in advance for your help guido aka deleondesign
fine i will wait and watch for a while you can see why i might be skeptical having waited more than half a year with no progress despite all this having been discussed before and me suggesting that it would be best if others implement anyway if jayjg is going to remove the list properly let him remove the list if he is going to remove only selected items from the list let him tell us what the criteria is as an aside the only thing impeding progress is all these other voices trying to talk for jayjg perhaps if galassi and others had not supported jayjg attempt to subvert wp brd jayjg and i could have finished the d in brd and we would have been able to work this out for ourselves or perhaps you are both wrong about jayjg intentions it all remains to be seen i am on the edge of my seat

royall page uses the baroness ashton of upholland because it about the leader of the house of lords and the peerage is used here we are linking to the commissioner for trade which does not use the title and she is thusly catherine ashton this is akin to how mandelson is only linked as the lord mandelson after he gained peerage though in reverse she has not lost it but it is not used when referring to her role in the eu so we use her birth name should she re enter british politics and become secretary of state for energy and climate change the link would use her title in peerage

regarding the wikileaks allegations they were reported in other media including here here and here regarding the gaddafi book printing affair it was mentioned here in an article written for the middle east forum by daniel nassif who is now the head of the congress funded al hurra the context clearly shows the link between nabih berri and his sister in law which is common knowledge in lebanon and was intended to demonstrate that berri works for his own interests and not for any specific ideals another source mentioning berri proximity to samira assi can be found here berri corruption is mentioned in scholarly books and these sources cannot by any standard be considered as either poor or unreliable simply running nabih berri corruption through google books can show the extent to which his corruption is mentioned and recorded furthermore the article should include a criticism section as is the case in many other biographies of living persons lastly regarding the sockpuppet you have blocked him for a week and i believe that he should have been blocked for a longer period as one of his accounts had been blocked for edit warring and he immediately created another account to insert his edits and his demonstrated knowledge of wikipedia rules prove that he was aware of his violations be it edit warring or sockpuppetry

to believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today is ridiculous this ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups convergent divergent convergent the 2d group was fixed and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile furthermore the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non linear cam based group distance regulation mechanism was not needed the downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range the development of sophisticated complex non linearly driven four group based designs focusing variator compensator relay master is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques computation algorithms manufacturing e g lower cost aspherical lenses numerical control machines to manufacture precise non linear driving cams and material science e g glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics

the wp rs policy does not classify dictionaries as tertiary sources they are not in fact compendia encyclopedias textbooks and other summarizing source they are secondary sources because they are the results of scholars who research primary sources in order to determine the meanings of words in fact the oxford english dictionary is the most reliable secondary source for the meanings of words in the english language it is common sense that if one wants to know the meaning of a word that one consults a dictionary ironically the twelve sources presented in the footnotes do not support the interpretation that user collect has provided also could we all please assume good faith

transclusion i have set up pages for each season of the show and moved the episode list data there i have copied the transclusion system used at list of lost episodes to ensure the information on the season pages and the main list remains consistent i note that there is a perceived loss of functionality to the list from some anonymous editors i think having a shorter main list with more detail on the season pages is preferable and follows a precedent set by the lost episodes featured topic i would like to emphasise that no information has been removed and all of the short synopses i worked hard on are still available on the season pages however i am happy to change the transclusion if lots of people want the entirety of the information to be duplicated i have included main article links to each of the season pages under each season header in the main article and hope that readers interested in finding out more information will go on to the season pages from the main episode list

please do not add unsourced negative or controversial biographical material to pages as you did with this edit to stuart tyson smith if you continue to do so you will be blocked from editing 13
but you are predicating the above on a false assumption one i said was one of the things you are accusing me of that fact is i have dealt with the issues jdchamp raised and done so in the proper forums and intend to continue if i ever see a constructive argument come his way the only extent to which i have not has been me trying to do exactly the same step back and take a deep breath since monday thing that you are now arguing i should do i honestly started to wonder if this was my imagination so i just checked i have even had a healthy discussion on the poll area with strunke one in which jdchamp would have been welcome to join in had he had more to say than the i demand administrator intervention you two are working together type accusations he been making not that i would have stopped him but the point is that seems to be the level of discussion i am not going to pretend there are not comments i made very early on that were unhelpful though any reasonable person would have seen them for what they were how was i to know what i was dealing with but nothing i have done rose to the level that your insults against me suggested and absolutely nothing at all nothing period rose to the level that i deserved to have my page vandalized every day with bogus warnings and pseudo make ups you know i have been on wikipedia now for well i guess well over a year now i have never had anything like this happen to me i have had robust discussions before i have never ever had a situation where someone was so obsessed with a technical detail that they decided to come to my talk page and post warnings over and over and over and over again or refused to post in the correct place when asked perhaps you regularly deal with worse people than that i do not know but i did not deserve this i reverted something that at the time was against consensus and i did it a grand total of twice i explained my reasons the nearest thing i did at the time that came to being uncivil was pointing out that deliberately making changes against consensus can be seen by many of us as vandalism what is happened since is ridiculous i am bewildered it happened and i am saddened you still are making the accusations against me that are very obviously not true
fix i think much of the article here warrants the or tags and the writing is better off in the himym wiki i believe the current version of list of recurring entourage characters is a good template for converting this in a more out of universe model i have started with the work and unless some anon or new account troll here raises a stink here i intend to see this through

your kind two notes of thanks i share some interests with you especially a dislike for pr editors although my pet peeve is the medical pr types who are pushing a point of view that is protective of the medical industry which is not always honest or accurate that is a far tougher fight than ronan farrow i also noticed a couple of things on your talk page http www worldmilitarybands com sousas marches i dated kieth brion daughter for many years and marched with him in the yale band at the yale harvard game one year no one has done more for military music then he and his love was john philips souza do not have much rs for you as that was his passion not mine i also know quite a bit about north korea i would probably have thought the bias article you created was a candidate for deletion but i am not that interested in doing that kind of advocacy i am interested in why you believe that north korea is significantly more functional than the media impression having studied both in some detail i think much of the basic premise of their reputation is well founded but i do appreciate different opinions
please explain further the article has a neutral tone throughout and is mostly about the history and evolution of yoga what specifically is not being addressed please note that articles are not required to have a criticism section in fact such a practice is deprecated in favor of addressing criticism in the article body in context what in the article specifially is not being addressed what are the positive views in the article talk
i have deleted the image of shiva altogether for the reasons cited above a good illustration of dreadlocks in antiquity would be great again the samson image is only somewhat better because at least the beard appears to be in sort of shirley temple curls if not dreads i would have preferred to leave that image in place until a better image could be found but another contributor stubbornly insists on deleting it despite the fact that a photo related to dreadlocks in india is already part of the article unfortunate

opening paragraph i restructured the opening paragraph without making major content changes for oine major reason 1 the most recent version stated the heidegger name and birth and went right to influences covention suggests that when one is coming to an encyclopedia one wants to know first who this person is rather than who they influenced a brief description of who and and what heidgger did should come before anything else so i changed it no other substantial change

dear welcome to wikipedia unfortunately using your e mail address as your username is not a good idea wikipedia content is extensively copied and the site itself is one of the most visited sites in the world any edit you make on wikipedia will have your username attached to it and using your email address will make you a tempting target for spammers we recommend that you change your username at wikipedia changing username in order to prevent abuse however if you have very few or no edits it might just be easier to create a new account if you need any help simply contact me on my talk page or go to wikipedia help desk another option is to place on your own talk page and someone will come shortly to help remember to sign your posts on talk pages with four tildes again welcome
not really requesting an unblock because i am not sure there any point to continue editing wikipedia if the winners in disputes are the ones who are pushing a years long agenda and manipulating content so that it reads as defamatory as possible without any corroborating documentation besides archive org oregon website and the losers are those who do all the hard work to expose the manipulators who are themselves socking themselves lying i merely hope that one of the other editors operating in the right will bring this tag team to the administrators noticeboard because the chicanery needs to stop

olympic formation and early years the name was chosen by james edmondson the club first treasurer and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of olympia site of the ancient olympic games it referenced by phythian p 7 yes that right decline and colapse in 1886 the club committee was forced to reduce the players wages to a quarter of what was being offered by preston north end why it is comparing with the pne it because some players went to play there simply because pne were the top club in the area it shows how much worse olympic wages were compared to the top club in the area hope that makes sense rivalries the rivalry became especially fierce in september 1884 when amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to poach each others star players the rovers secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against olympic in the 1884 85 season it referenced by phythian pp 63 66 yes that right cheers

4 january 2012 utc if we were following best practices the secondary sources from both points of view would be fairly represented in the article at present that is not the case what makes your judgement superior to that of the scores of editorial boards and peer reviewers who have included lenr articles in dozens of unquestionably reputable journals or superior to that of the the nasa navy and army scientists who put their careers on the line to work on a controversial subject they say will have a larger impact than any other energy technology do you have some special expertise pertaining to electroweak interactions which allows you to absolutely rule out the hundreds of reports of anomalous effects or any evidence that the proponents are lying or deluded why are so many people on this issue unable to deal with the uncertainly inherent in the controversy we have some people trying to deny the controversy even exists while at the same time referring to its two sides and now these heavy duty personal attacks what is it about this subject that makes so many editors absolutist exclusionist and advocates of bias instead of npov adherents 18 35

this article which originally appeared in the london independent on august 13 2002 is i think excellent in both sensitively disputing the official account of flight 93 and highlighting the us media reluctance to do so i am unaware if the titular questions have been answered in the past three years or whether the journalist sources have since been discredited cberlet as you seem confident that they have been do please provide proof otherwise i maintain that parts of this wikipedia article is based on american public opinion rather than fact http www world action co uk independent html
in response to the message you left on my page it is not my fault that professor gubby just happens to have the exact same life history as this eric thomas who by the way i have never heard of before also calling peoples names illy nicknames is simply ignorant there are some names from various other cultures around the world that some narrow minded people may dismiss as illy but just because they sound unusual to you it makes them no less important i have also scanned through your discussion page and it seems i am not the only person annoyed by your trigger happy editing skills i thought wikipedia was a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit so called grammar nazis like yourself have no place anywhere free speech is allowed if my page is not undeleted soon i will consider further action

okay i do not necessarily understand nor agree however i do concede that it is a direct answer to part of my question i do object to the word personal regarding what it implies to how i would obtain it however you have implied a concession as to how i would gotten it therefore i do accept that the humor of your edit makes my comment appear as if a link to something like social insecurity i have got your number in bed get your number into bed if anyone ever produces that you i should share royalties although it does not comment on the element of my question regarding watchdog i do think contend that they are relevant as competition both are credible article subjects due to their dominance prevalence i do not necessarily endorse nor agree with either of these companies to what extent i would agree with various elements of what they actually do would be a very complex issue of its own thank you hopiakuta please do sign your signature on your message 7e 7e thank you

hindutva as defined by savarkar baguely means indian nationalism that draws its inspiration from hindu maratha culture it cant be called hindu extremism is broadest sense largely since hindu fundamentalism is an oxymoron moreover founding fathers of hindutva were agnostic hindus hindutva rose as a complementary movement to marathi cultural resurgence all founders were marathis specifically marathas and konkanastha brahmins and till 1970 most memebers of rss were marathis hindutva in these days is a vague ideology it differs from one propounded by savarkar to the one practised by parties like shiv sena and bajrang dal btw i was an active hss member till about 2003 before i left hindutva for good
problems on kurdish articles first of all the kurdish flag is allowed in iran but is not sanctioned publicly kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them it is certainly not criminal in iran for kurds to have the kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do so edit your statement about it being criminal in iran need i remind you all that kurds are ethnic iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination kurds face in syria iraq and turkey it is usually israeli sources with increasing american and british help and aid that intentionally falsely claim that the kurdish flag which fly the pan iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the azerbaijani people and the flag of tajikistan is prohibited in iran flying the kurdish flag in iran is not criminal as it is mentioned by israeli sources furthermore i go on to read that there was research done that basically proves kurds and jews are genetically the same it seems to me that certain individuals who i can see are israeli are following the israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the middle east kurds are iranians just as how russians serbs poles and bulgarians are all slavic peoples israel the usa and britain are trying to create conflict in iran as was done in the former yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines this is called balkanisation the israelis are doing this covertly through operations in iraqi kurdistan propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history i am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an iranian from a minority group that is neither persian nor kurdish i can tell you that kurds are definitely ethnic iranians in all senses from tradition to language history culture identity and genetics i am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the iranian identity of kurds as i was told by a kurdish professor mr eskandari in tehran kurds are iranian and the entity of iran as a state and nation was founded by the main ancestors of the kurds the mede who established iran as an empire one problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term persian and iranian persians are iranian but all iranians like the kurds and ossetians are not persians the mede and other similar iranian groups are the ancestors of the kurds but not the only group just like how the ancient persians are the main ancestors of the modern persians but not the only ancestors ancestors of persians and kurds also include arabs mongols and other iranian peoples i ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact there was a time when the turkish government tried to convince kurds that they were mountain turks and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the kurds from their iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young kurds forget or be unaware of their iranian ethnicity this is due to geo strategic schemes these forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely iranian the covert foreign policy of israel britain and america comes at the expense of the kurds and even their history and culture the enemies of science the arts and knowledge are the enemies of all mankind
sure if i have time and if you remain positive and constructive
interesting reference to this article i just finished listening to the audiobook of simple genius by david baldacci and in an authors note at the end he specifically mentions this wikipedia article as a reference for the beale cipher worth a mention
whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well many readers will come to this page read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section without differentiating in a small way my two points we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole it is a defect of this article that it talks too much about cures which indeed gives a biased view the controversy section is best kept short as there is a main article i agree the controversy section is best kept short not incorrectly biased and lacking information as it currently stands the controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise that is all there is to it your anaolgy is about as crass as saying oh look theres a dead body there lets use it for fertilizer after all its dead
siberian exploration section on the age of discovery page hi i looked through the section did a little copy editing etc it looks pretty accurate except for the demid pyanda part which i believe may be of a very dubious character i can add references later if you like does not look like it needs too much changing though
except this account was not advertising this account made a request on an article talk page that had it been made directly on the article page might have been problematic that exactly what we ask people with potential cois to do o

lol i am not sure anybody wants to get involved in that one the topic banned editor user andreasgde came up with a temp solution of avoiding the usage of the the beatles midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011 until i stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks it would seem the hundreds of articles concerning the beatles group the beatles members albums and compositions use the syntax i just used user gabemc wants to start changing all ocurrences to the beatles mid sentence with his straw poll when editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages his argument is that each article can ignore wp mostm on it own consensus and only war in two or three articles so far on this issue trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage old documents wp mos vs wp mostm english grammar or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not my concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesi have read the issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of arbitated policy continues the randon edits even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this when all the beatles played together the beatles made good music i am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions nobody seems to want to take them on some agreed that a shot across the bow may be in order funny thing all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but wo not muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention the mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to grow the fuck up and other less rude demands it would seem all five or six gabemc supporters consistently spell andreasegde name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections i have witnessed that and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental to me man i hate this stuff i just cannot believe this is happening on wp with all these rules and tough nuts 99 251 125 65

article issues this article has some issues that need to be addressed the first is that of notability as it is now the article fails to establish any notability it is merely a plot summary and as was explained numerous times at talk list of ncis episodes wikipedia is not for plot summaries it is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own as per wp plot a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work but on its own the plot does not establish notability as it says in the notability tag that kepps getting removed notability needs to be established by adding reliable secondary sources at the moment there are none more on this later the plot summary in this article is not concise by any means it needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning the reception impact and significance of the episode must be added a third issue is that of references i have already mentioned that reliable secondary sources do not exist in the article of the two references that do exist in the article one is a primary source the other cbsncis wetpaint com is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source open wikis such as cbsncis wetpaint com are questionable self published sources and are generally not acceptable the expansion of this article will require much better sources

having done some research on mend and other east african insurgent groups since my first edit in late april i would be happy to see legitimate counterarguments against mend activities unfortunately i have not been able to find any it really does look like this is a situation where they are the least bad of multiple organizations doing questionable things and i think the article should represent that we should not shy away from discussing what they do wrong armed insurrection for one kidnapping and holding of innocent hostages for another but the fact that shell is up against the alien tort law in us courts right now for the alleged despoiling of the niger delta might yield better information as to this issue as it wends its way through discovery and trial

it is not about dumbing down it about the use of unambiguous language the articles linked to by phenomena and artefact still leave the meanings of those words ambiguous we do not have to stick religiously to the words used in the literature particularly if like with these they are ambiguous in english we should paraphrase if we need to especially if it is a literal rather than a meaning translation from french as much of this appears to be i think we need to forge a compromise between what is there now and something easier to grasp the true meaning of i will offer the following as a starter in this spirit manufacturable and repeatable standards example physical standards of the base units used in the metric system capable of being accurately manufactured known as realisable by the bipm ideally with reference to naturally occurring stable physical constants or phenomena rather than to a single existing physical object or artefacts the bipm publish a set of instructions for how to manufacture a reference standard for each of the base units this is known as a mise en pratique in french the primary language of the bipm where practical at the time the definitions of the base units were developed so that a suitably equipped laboratory would be able to construct an acceptably accurate reference standard without the need to compare it with an existing physical object which may not be available locally in practice such such realisation is done under the auspices of what is known as a mutual acceptance arrangement maa please discuss
definition i am not happy with the definition as it stands and i would like to see a reference for the assertion that horslips were the first to name the genre celtic in modern usage means more than the ancient celts and much music that involves the lives of modern celts is considered celtic thus there no reason a band like the pogues who sung frequently about irish matters should be considered less celtic simply because they were focused on the present similarly i see no reason horslips driving hard rock is more suited towards being real celtic rock than the blues influenced music of l l era fairport

just because b and 8 are similar does not mean that they are same similarly love jihad and forced conversion may look similar to some but they are not same in love jihad one has a jihadist impulse which is far more fanatical and unscrupulous than the normal islamist impulse to convert resulting in forced conversion so they are at a totally different level and are distinct concepts there may be other differences too i myself am doing or here but my or gets no place in the article this source is being used on the strength of the or that love jihad is same similar to forced conversion and this is how it becomes a violation of wp or policy and that is why it should have no place in the article i am afraid using this source does involve synthesis here how the source is being used to convey the sense that love jihad is an imaginary baseless concept this is being done on the strength of the or that love jihad and forced conversion are same similar combining it with the source is being used to convey that the source is saying that love jihad is a baseless concept this is how it is synthesis actually we have no source except the opinion of wp eds which are inadmissible in article space that the two concepts are same similar this source does not say that the issue of love jihad is baseless it is only saying things about forced conversion etc so you see the synthesis part now the source is being made to say things it does not say i hope i have been able to convey myself clearly thanks arbitrary break

stereotypes are the way of thinking for ignorant and perfidious roastbeefs that never accepted to get their arse kicked by the french in the most important war ever the 100 hundred years war the rest is peanuts or maybe was it because the french humiliated them at yorktown and saved the ungrateful yanks or maybe was it because the french speaking normands defeated the roastbeefs and introduced the french language in this country of savages or maybe this is just because the french are catholics and the roastbeefs are protestants

vandalism on b theory of time it seems perhaps i have been going about this the wrong way so i will try to be helpful and explain why your last edit was vandalism first off the description intro the quality of the intro had been greatly increased naming mctaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section hence there is no need for it the description gave a better just of what b thoery of time is a whole undoing this completely is therefore vandalism especially if you don y first talk about it in the talk page before editing secondly you removed would escription you then deleted the description as in metaphysics changed the better updated version of the physics part then moved it in the origin section there really is nothing i can say about this i have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move thirdly you removed this section it is noted by dean zimmerman in presentism and the space time manifold that a theory is almost certainly a minority view among philosophers while b theory has achieved broad acceptance http fas philosophy rutgers edu zimmerman presentism 20and 20rel for web 2 pdf it seems you perhaps have a personal agenda favouring a theory therefore editing in favour of it this is not allowed on wikipedia and it is vital to keep a neutral point of view the above statement however is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it finally and on the most relevant side you craig information it is an improvement that you have put the craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section however a lot of it is not quoted rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact such as the b theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory namely that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance the buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality but this is not the case with temporal becoming you stated this outright this is an opinion of craig it should be demonstrated as such i also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion in fact you have stated all of craig opinions as fact if you want to make edits please first discuss them in the talk page and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not and how it should be worded docheuh

dbachmann i am not in the least surprised by your civil and composed response maybe decius english is no better than his ancient greek certainly his seething rage is unjistified and highly indicative of a person with an agenda and in denial i will read the rest of the talk page at my leisure because it is quite lengthy as for the katadesmos what is there to discuss i already provided a translation in english would you like me to expand on the grammar used it interesting that you ask that the slate be cleaned i see nothing on my slate if decius wishes to he can start by offering apologies for calling me all these horrible insults and most especially the weasel part which came even after his olive branch the hypocrisy of it he should apologize earnestly unreservedly and abjectly unless he does so i will have every right to be calling him the window urinator his words not mine in the meantime i would like to ask you to take a look at this article featured external link http www geocities com indoeurop project glossary mace html and comment on it i think it pathetically amateurish
peer review i have put in a request for peer review for the article i believe it would be good for getting some perspective outside of myself and others who have frequently edited this article and it the first step to getting the entry made a featured article on english wikipedia please feel free spread the word on related talk pages your help is greatly appreciated
at one time www adl org hate_symbols but this does not work now try the web archive people
the sources cited in the article are and always have been reliable abc news popular science esquire magazine and so on anyone who thinks that these sources are not legitimate by wikipedia standards has a severe reading comprehension problem you are vandalizing a legitimate wikipedia entry i am requesting that you desist by the way that non negotiable
the change is seamless all redirects are being fixed including quite a few that were missed by people when these were moved in the past we get these in dribs and drabs over at wp rm a few a week easier to just clean them up as for projects they do not overrule the policy of wp name and wikipedia manual of style infoboxes design and usage standardization is a good thing we will continue to grow these boxes will be used in the future and changing them means when we reach 6 million articles the future ones that would have used the prior name will use the proper name moreover when people seek to create new infoboxes just as often or maybe more often they do not learn what the title should be by going to the policy but by looking at where existing similarly situated templates reside and by standardizing we foster the creation of new templates at proper names please also see wikipedia do not worry about performance
your claim that the soldiers were on their own sovereign territory so they were not getting into anything is contested israel claims that hezbollah crossed into israel killing 8 soldiers and capturing 2 while the lebanese claim that the two soldiers were in lebanon and that israeli aircraft were flying over lebanese airspace when the soldiers were arrested by local police officials i agree with that the mere status of being a soldier makes you a legitimate target it seems that you think its okay for israel to capture and kill members of hezbollah even though they are civilians but are still a legitimate target but that when hezbollah captures two israeli soldiers that they are not a legitimate target in sum you claim when israel captures or kills civilian lebanese who belong to hezbollah they are killing or capturing a legitimate enemy target but when hezbollah captures or kills israeli soldiers they are not capturing or killing a legitimate enemy target again this is a false dichotomy and is a clear point of view violation you also seem to have a predilection towards claiming that your point of view is fact as if appealling to the authority of fact will grant your point of view a superior position

i agree with your quote windows needs constant user help to maintain itself people will only defrag scan for viruses un install programs and the list goes on and on and on when windows is playing up and or running slow i know some small businesses who make money out of fixing slow computers running windows i am sure linux can be defragmented and i reckon my own linux drive is fragmented but the performance is so fast that it not a problem if ubuntu linux ever started going slow i would need to worry about performing the necessary maintenance that windows users have to constantly battle with but so far ubuntu is running as fast as it did on day one with no constant maintenance so yes windows needs constant user help to maintain itself

april 2011 utc request for mediation in removing mclellan and the marine corps from manookian page armenian issues i have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on arman manookian to no avail as a matter of fact i requested mediation with no response moreover a consensus of assisting editors informed me when i tried to include arman manookian on the list of historically notable marines that arman manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of marine corps history based on that guidance i deleted references to mcclellan a marine corps historian on manookain page now i note the very same editors who opined that manookian did not warrant inclusion on the list of historically notable marines insist on including mcclellan name and the marine corps on manookian page for propaganda purposes i have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from manookian accomplishments independent of the united states marine corps history it appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to armenians moreover 3 linked references to mcclellan and the marine corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about is it about manookian or mclellan or the united states marine corps although i am assuming good faith several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of bias for a pov and propaganda i do not believe mediation is consistent with an editing war moreover as i stated before in assuming good faith it appears as though manookian page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the marine corps yet when simple solutions are offered such as including manookian and mcclellan on the list of historically notable marines it is ignored because his last name ends in ian and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr despite the fact that on the editor assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered i followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason manookian was taken off the list of historically notable marines was because he was a clerk and mcclellan only said nice things about his name and fame are intertwined with it marine corps history him because he felt sorry that manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first marine corps historical artist illustrator i followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well this type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized moreover there seems to be a concerted effort by so called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on marine corps history that have a problem with historically notable marines whose last names end in ian or who volunteered for suicide missions apparently it has something to do with recruitment of armenians for martyrdom during wwii and the marine corps subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same armenian american marines for political and financial reasons at this point i ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an armenian american marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers 00 44 10

zahn we have to cite sources in wikipedia simple as that that does not however mean that what it says in the article is not a bit presumptive it is obvious that we have a limited ability to monitor abortions in many poor or undemocratic countries who has cited it as approximately 50 million in 2001 and an estimated 40 50 million in 2003 http www who int reproductive health publications safe_abortion safe_abortion pdfan other sources have it as low as 20 million or as high as 88 million as far as i can see none of these estimations are as hihly regarded as the lancet however my point is that a number as exact as 42 million or 46 million should be regarded as estimations not approximations it is also called so in the lancet article this may be a small difference but still lets change it to the estimated number in stead of the approximate number
the new picture cinches itgood work the new picture of lee harvey oswald holding a rifle and other incriminating evidence is much better than the similar one that was in the article see exhibit 746 a from the warren commission the new picture is much darker and conceals the apparent fabrication of the photo as complained about by oswald before he was shot we have to keep in mind that the fabrication of photographs back in 1963 was still rather primitive the similar pictures that the warren commission had available are either blow ups of the picture which are too revealing or have disastrous results or the print is not dark enough to conceal the cut and paste job on the face of which oswald complained see for example warren commission ex 746 c with the face pasted on at the level of the chin it was also a wise choice not to use exhibit 749 because it has that embarrassing oversight where someone drew in what appeared to be the butt of the gun stock for another photograph and re used it with the triangular piece of gun stock still drawn in see third picket from oswald leg it actually might be better just to describe the pictures and not reproduce if the reader looks at one picture the reader might look at the rest

thanks for keeping an eye on just me neuro oh not sock puppetry but oh oops i meant reverts against consensus ok i got it made an error when he all of a sudden banned me for one week without warning it was originally for sock puppetry which was a false accusation in the first place but he really meant the ban because his reason should have been persistent rvs against consensus again where are these persistent reverts against consensus i tried to edit an article about a bridge awhile back got hammered by noclador gun powder ma for adding citations most people who actually looked at what i was trying to do stated i was editing very civil and that these two were out of line of how they attacked me this time i am trying to add back citations and including extra ones that show the use of adesc aut in ladin ok there is disagreement if it is proper usage or not what is new noclador says he knows ladin scholars who are adamant against its use ok get them to publish something and we can cite their opinions and add it to the article i do not care he has become utterly obsessed that i am part of some conspiracy it was originally a user from the netherlands who added the adesc aut because there are a few ladin websites that use the term i added the an official trilingual document from ortisei using that term are they wrong maybe maybe not whatever we simply cite references we do not cite what someone told us down at the local coffee shop but i dare edit any page in noclador gun powder ma domain and i must therefore be attacked if i am banned for a week those two should be banned for a month for their constant bashing of anyone who edits the pages against the way they feel things should be no compromise no sharing we are going back to the good ole days

call name it is not uncommon to give a child several vornamen particularly for girls and among catholics usually one of them is meant to be normally used and called the rufname call name this is often underlined on official documents as it is often the second or third name in a list even though it is the person main name the idea of first names being more important than middle names as is usually the case in anglo saxon cultures is unknown i think this section is quite dated my grandfather born in 1904 had a rufname which was actually his second vorname but nowadays this is rather uncommon in germany legally one can use any of the vornamen one was given as one preferred rufname and even change it without any prerequisite so if the current german minister for economics karl theodor zu guttenberg wanted to he could use any of his 10 vornamen as the name to be called with except for the maria i guess but in reality such things rarely happen btw the example shows not only girls can have many vornamen though 10 is a bit excessive such large numbers of names are mostly confined to former nobility there are even court decisions limiting the number of vornamen a mother was not allowed to give her child 12 vornamen but only 5

changes can not get slower than they are 1 you say there was only revert i think you mean that only involved using the undo button compare and with this latter being the last of a series starting here so you could say that in two edits causteau reverted 4 edits of mine of course this was only one recent example the same pattern continues over months 2 concerning the approach you suggest surely this is what i have been trying to do for some months now you insist on saying that if this is a problem then this must be because there are different opinions about specific facts and sources but this is not the case at all causteau own explanations to you above make his attitude clear which is that he will revert anything he can find a reason to revert and he finds people making lots of edits somehow against wikipedia policy if necessary he will keep looking for new reasons he can experiment with after others are knocked down and he is willing to revert before he has his argument together as well on the basis that people should not be edited until he has had his satisfaction

my 2 cents aaron claim y is true because if x then y mrvoluntarist argument if x then z z is false therefore not x thus aaron argument is invalid note that mrvoluntarist argument does not prove y is false it simply proves that y is true because if x then y is not a valid argument if mrvoluntarist had said that aaron claim was z that would have been a strawman but mrvoluntarist simply showed to aaron satisfaction that x was false that is not a strawman that simply pointing out a false premise x is if an action is violent then it is wrong y is the violent act of shooting trespassers is wrong z is the violent act of fighting in a war is wrong

an apt description no one is really arguing against the desirability of a citation in a biography article especially a blp confirming attendance at a particular educational institute however some myself included would disagree with the view that such citations are or should be mandatory for bluelinked names in the notable alumni section of the educational institute itself i think we might all be able to agree that any redlinked unlinked names should have a citation to at least demonstrate that that person is notable enough such that a wikipedia article about them should pass afd alas the relevant wp policies appear somewhat inconsistent and their interactions need clarification

i am trying to make it fair what is your problem
i did not hang around that site to long either but it clearly said it publishes a newpaper in 12 languages if he already publishes a newspaper in multiple languages presumably he has sufficient number of translators on board the site did mention that there were a number of translations of the poisonous mushroom were currently being worked on at the very least there is an english translation and obviously the original german version as there is an estonian translation then likely there would be a finnish one too and russian as well if this translator is over 40 being the usa i do not think a spanish version would be difficult to come by seems to me the reason that the estonian version is highlighted on this site was because of the fact that it had drawn the attention of the estonian police not because it was uniquely available in the estonian language as implied by the wikipedia article
jayjg is there any edit to this article you would accept what are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs religious definitions of jews the article is currently confusing as to which is which and it would help to clarify that jfj means ethnic jews i think in the case mackan points out many is appropriately used many jewish groups do see jfj that way but certainly not all i would imagine there are plenty of jewish groups without any official position on jfj also most religions are rather fluid and change over time and there is often debate over interpretation it is therefore not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact jews do not believe in jesus as messiah what about messianic judaism of course religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism my way is the correct one type of thinking so sometimes it difficult to see debates to that as valid wp weasel does not object to ever using many or most or the like as qualifiers it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing what we have here is a lot of sourcing which does not however show that all jews object to jfj as i explained above that would be effectively impossible it does of course show that many do i would not even object to almost all or most but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of wp npov jfj assertion that it is jewish must be treated as plausible it is impossible that all jewish organizations disagree as jfj does not

where are all the assumptions obviously this only holds true if the monkey lives for ever as t infty the support of the any probability distribution function does not decrease the length of time the type writer is broken is not above some limit the first point is obvious the second just means that say your a monkey and you you start pressing the buttons sooner or later you would expect the monkey to realize that the biggest event happens when you press the return carriage key and thus it is entirely plausible that the monkey would never press any of the other keys again in fact there are even similar reasons this could fail it could well be the case that the width of the finger of the monkey are such that it never hits only one key rather it hits two or more which in turn could cause this theorem to fail the last point is about what if the type writer broke surely the time between break downs would have to be strictly less that than the time necessary to type the number of characters in the text

why are there no images is it because this is madness it not like he saw flaming penises rape hell the visions in this book are visual picturesque photogenic popular with artists and not at all child disturbing they need to be seen even simple diagrams could help anyone studying this book to keep track of what ezekiel sees and conquer the poetry the symbolism should be analyzed organized compared to other instances and linked to relevant articles to better understand at least make a list of symbols used this is one of the most encyclopedia friendly books in the book and could shed light on topics such as cherub vision religion cubit c feel free to draw your own accurate version as images can bypass the no original research rule a beautiful picture could earn the article status such as cool with females or royal with england but it does not have to be national geographic quality if it too much it could be moved to another exegesis of the book of ezekiel page that analyzes the most important interpretations including things like suzanne haik vantoura decipher hurry before 90 of wikipedia material is about football

hey glad to hear from you this is jazzy admittedly i am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto and my actions have been less than perfect but i wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named cody hedman and dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted i felt i did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down i admit i made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto firstly i created cdub1985 a run off of the guy i wrote about and then jazzy 006 jazzy 007 and i got my friends to try and keep it on honestly my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but i do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about honestly what i wrote was not a vanity article and i just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way i was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and i retaliated you know i treated dcandeto bad but i feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work asap thanks jazzy

school location london or surrey there been an amusing tit for tat re edit of the location of whitgift school as a result of user samtheboy mistakenly believing that the school is in the county of surrey without wishing to sound like an anorak this greater london vs the old county boundaries around london is a bit of an old chestnut significant changes in local government in the 1960s and 70s the result of the inexorable spread of suburban london meant that towns like croydon kingston and bromley in the south were swallowed up by london becoming the london borough of croydon etc one old county middlesex disappeared altogether confusingly the post office retained the old names disregarding the new borough locations and to this day people in places like thornton heath believe they live in surrey a fact which could not be further from the truth the same is true of south croydon which is in the london borough of croydon and hence greater london the county of surrey begins further down the road and the local council taxpayers commercial ratepayers and other residents of south croydon pay their taxes have their roads repaired and their refuse collected by the local london borough i suppose the reaction is who cares but if wikipedia has pretentions to accuracy we should get these things right nowhere will samtheboy or anyone else find any accurate evidence that whitgift school is in surrey because the simple fact is that it is not end of sermon

no the schofield text rarely makes claims of the first sort that is one of its major problems actually it does not effectively place priestley in his historical milieu i had to rely on other sources such as tapper to do that most of the generalized statements about priestley importance do not come from schofield i would not rely on the jp a comet in the system book it is not the most reliable text we have see publication information and citing a dissertation is sad to say not the first line of defense i already listed that schofield quote above which shows priestley indebtedness to other eighteenth century thinkers that list is more reliable in my opinion i agree that schofield is partial to priestley it was kind of frustrating actually because it was the most complete account of priestley there was talk

i will say this again it says the spanish empire meet the criteria to be called a superpower if the term existed back then which it did not the term superpower was coined after wwii to refer to the u s soviet union and the u k not past superpowers the great powers page talks about past superpowers and it would be much better suited there that way the same thing is not talked about in the same articles and what is with you with the spanish empire the french empire at it height was just as powerful as the spanish empire so why is not it listed it meet all of the criteria for being a superpower but it is not here because there are too many former superpowers and listing just a select few is pov that is why the great powers page exists to talk about past and present great powers superpowers the spanish empire is not listed on the great powers page so why do not you add it instead of trying to add it to this page where it does not belong also just because you find a source for something it does not mean that it is encyclopedic just because something says if the term existed back them does not mean that it belongs here user daniel_chiswick 16 april 2007

removal of peg entwistle while i am aware that original research is frowned upon here in wiki world i do know that inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims are even more so having said that before anyone deletes my deletion please know that as peg entwistle biographer i have been scrutinizing every claim made regarding her i have also interviewed her family including her brother milton entwistle peg had a room at the family beachwood canyon drive house and stayed there whenever she was in town although milton is over 90 he is sharp as a tack and remembers as yesterday his sister living in the house and not at the hollywood studio club apartments also my search into the records receipts and rental agreements of hsc did not find a single item mentiong peg entwistle
well since tony the tiger i mean marine seems to be waffling and going back on his report of nyc being confirmed to him a friend or maybe his mother who really knows he seems to be self serving and desirious of changing the facts rules policies et al in order to gain favor from future voters for gov of pr when he runs he certainly has shown his true colors and how he ever became an administrator surely puts wiki at the forefront of the pandering and self serving purposes displayed here i think i know a way that those who support puerta rico as his pob tony should ask his friend the cop no doubt another greasy spic in florida to write an internet article about baez and include in it a reference to the tmz and other bogus unreliable references and the report that baez office personnel lied and that baez was indeed born in puerta rico while this would be a fabrication and in effect a lie we all know that cops are professional overpaid liars to begin with so this would not be a problem for his greasy cop spic friend then they would have the support of a confirmed verifiable and believable source to cite in place of the nationally televised television interview by bw subsequently the puerta rican loving dirtbags can invalidate any consensus and ignore everyone that is in search of the truth this entry has been archived and we shall see if this page remains or it disappears from view have a nice day 98 64 75 179

new age spiritual leader in the article about new age it is written that the new age movement is a western spiritual movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century blavatsky passed away much earlier in 1891 so it is not precise to categorize her in new age spiritual leaders i suggest to move her into a new category new age precursors or new age predecessors where swedenborg vivekananda and others can also be done other predecessors also included

npov i believe the following assertion belies a non neutral point of view two feminist historians elizabeth mason hohl and kate campbell hurd mead wrote about trotula in the 1930s 40s both women made false and unsupported elaborations about trotula s life leading to misconceptions that last to this day to call mason hohl and hurd mead claims false and elaborate is groundless especially given that hurd mead text is still today one of the most reliable sources for the study of the history of science moreover primary source evidence exists to prove that women graduated from the school of salerno i will add this information to the article presently but i do hope that the above quote can be removed

i am sorry but not bothering to provide an explanaition when editing coupled with the laundry list of prior warning and editing to slant of pov push reduces the likelyhood that but that what it says will excuse or justify the changes edit warring to keep your changes on three articles even if they are correct is not going to work more ove it is going to get you blocked for wp disruptive editing you have the option of explaining why your edits should stand on the article talk pages and let other editors decide if they should be made or not consider this a final warning on the matter
remove entire article is of questionable notability there also appears to be an agenda here being pushed often through tag team and uncivil retorts on this talk page wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of not censored rhetoric each day i am waiting for a photo of a sheep shagger to appear on welsh or scottish article under the guise of notability some editors here have serious pro gay coi pov issues and need to step back especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of homophobia out of turn why is the solo female fister a cartoon and the male fister a photo for a start not very neutral why does there even need to be a photo when all the article needs is a description i mean it hardly rocket science and that guy hardly has a rocket worth shouting about you do not need a photo on how to boil eggs so why one here again it anti wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids more agenda politically motivated more pornographic less educational detrimental to every other article contributor who wants to see wiki develop sadly it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites when they themselves use not censored as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination photos such as this are what lead to the foundation considering an image filter recently i am pro lgb t but i also believe in behind closed doors and i disagree with anyone who says kids wo not look it up when i was young kids looked dirty words up in the dictionary now the internet is here and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds let put it this way because of no legal threats no lgbt members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this coppa stands a better chance as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship where there is limited parental control wikikamasutra anyone chat rff

i agree that stevietheman suggestion is the most appropriate to implement jhp if you are talking about the 14 54 27 june 2007 24 209 30 113 edit 141014976 entry that i reverted it is because the content was taken directly from the incidents page without any regard for either a including the references themselves or b not following the wp blp policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident if you are talking about the 22 32 2 july 2007 realkyhick edit 142152748 entry that i reverted it because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the incidents page and the link to the incidents page was also removed by realkyhick at that time if you are talking about your edit 147620955 from the 29th that was just a copy of the same info from the incidents page poorly included and badly placed in the article while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident including it in the intro section is not really appropriate either especially as it in essence duplicated information that was posted further down the page yes i know that you will disagree with the in essence part but go with me on the concept as for an official wp policy there are guidelines listed in the help section on what makes a good article i like to think that the incidents articles fall under wp better articles_covering_subtopics

academic writings tend to offer a broad spectrum of views on any issue particularly when it comes to journals which are concerned with the quality of justification for a viewpoint rather than how correct it may be in practice in either case an academic critique of the law is not the law as it stands today and it is incorrect to state that duress is at this time although it may be reclassified so in the future a justification when plainly in jugements such as most recently in r v hasan and in r v wilson that duress is refered too expressly as an excuse in case it should interest you obiter statements in the recent case of r v wilson 2007 appear to be expressing the appeal court displeasure with the hard line taken in hasan and may well be the basis for some future appeal which might provide yet more clarity i remain resolute that the wording excuse as it is used in ratio decidendi should be correct term applied in the article rather than justification which while there may be an arguement for is not the terminology being applied in practiced law today

feb 2005 utc i would like to know how you earned the title to decide who is a serious conservative and who is not also how is that relavant to whether something is npov or not i do not think your comment has anything to do with what is npov but i am absolutely sure that your comment indicates that you are bias it does not matter if byrd was a kleagle 60 years ago or 50 years ago or if was a kleagle in 2001 when he was talking about white n the fact that he was a kleagle is the probably one of the most important aspects of his whole career he even admits that himself when he tells other potential kleagles not to become kleagles because the whole kleagle thingeven if you are like byrd and think the kleagle thing is coolwill hurt you because guys like me the supposedly unserious conservative will remind him of his kleagle days every chance that i get byrd was a kleagle and that is one of the most important aspects of his whole career he even admits the fact that his kleagle ness has held him back to bigger and better things and do not argue that he did not want bigger and better things than to be the head kleagle from west virginia he did run for the presidency and the whole kleagle surely could not have helped you like the guy so you want to minimize the kleagle thing but it would not be npov because that who byrd is the oldest highest ranking kleagle still in politics head kleagle grand kleagle of the senate el demo grande kleagle 03 24 16

oh i know vk was no angel i was there when the blue touchpaper was lit and i was there when the fireworks finally burned out he was argumentative arrogant prone to flare ups and would not let go on an issue once he had his ire up however he was also subject to a relentless campaign of harassment for years by people who should know better and there was a small group of the same few admins who had a dislike for him and would watch his contributions for a pretext to block him he had much the same role in 2007 as giano had in 2008 or malleus in 2009 however again like malleus and giano as you say when he was not involved in his scorpions in a bottle routine with kb and rp which was most of the time he was helpful productive hardworking and willing to get stuck into the boring minutiae which far too many of the grand actors of wikipedia think is beneath them there a qualitative difference between a dog which is repeatedly poked with a stick and eventually bites its pokers and a rabid dog who attacks people at random even if the net result of both is people get bitten and the dog gets shot in any case length of block log is generally an awful measure of problematicness a truly problematic user generally only has one entry in their block log scent

joshbuddy with due respect given your manifest ignorance lack on this subject then on what basis am i to accept your opinion of the verified lead in language rather than my own opinion that the verified lead in language is fine for goodness sake your previous edit asserted gross error on an extremely important subject one where continued health and or life have hung in the balance more than a few times as for the rest of the article i do plan on addressing some pure opinion therein and to add verification where it is needed along the way despite this future work and contrary to your opinion the current introduction does provide sufficient summarization for an encyclopaedic entry before you tinker anymore with this subject i recommend you read a wide range of peer reviewed literature on the same subject you ll find the current verified introductory language to be consistent that you have not applied yourself to this endeavour already is manifest so i am not making any assumptions on this point this is a very serious subject deserving of a very high standard of presentation and substantiation

destructuring of the article ladies and gentlemen apart from painful neutrality issue i am concerned with the growing deformation of the article structure and style i am talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors which i could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again two weeks ago i removed the duplicating and excessicely detailed sentences as well as irrelevant images from ukraine section and the other side seemed to agree non images edit now i find new duplicating passages in the first section although the intro looks better now editors who responsible for this did you care reading section in the whole and more new lenghty redundant subsection on vitebsk appeared not to mention the images which litter only ukraine section is this a permanent trollish attack on ukrainian editors why doing things like that i can understand pov pushing intentions of pro partisans users but we must first of all care about innocent readers not concerned with survival of either russia or ukraine otherwise the project would degrade and jimbo would run out of his budget distinctively on images issue i will put npov tag unless they will be removed in a week
other new post soviet states if there is this article comprising 2 mostly unrecognized states then i think it would make more sense either if each state had its own corresponding article or if all states would have the same article so far south ossetia abkhazia nagorno karabakh republic transnistria and more disputedly donetsk people republic and luhansk people republic this is not a political statement it just a question

i would say the toronto star article on mon july 12th would be the most accurate because their information would have come from the official police report about the incident correcting any mis information or initial errors about the incident snopes would most likely relied on the toronto star sat copy and not the monday edition for their source
fluence until you understand that your contributions are of an extremely low quality and learn how to fix them you will simply be an annoyance to wikipedia all of your updates and articles are useless fan cruft you waste time by nominating it all to be displayed on the front page and you are are abusive to people who offer criticism even of the polite constructive sort you should perhaps focus your attentions on making a keane fan site and stop trying to turn wikipedia into one nobody likes keane fluence they are terrible

i understand the fact that wikipedia is not a crystal ball however mathematical collingwood has won the minor premiership as they only lost one match to geelong three including today against sydney i does not matter if collingwood win lose or draw with geelong next week because collingwood has 80 points while geelong has 72 points as you know each win is worth 4 points so collingwood are definitively this year minor premiers so please do not remove collingwood as minor premiers from this year afl season many thanks mcausten

the alleged i 605 back in 2000 here what was reported about the possibility of an i 605 being built another wsdot released study in 2000 suggested an i 605 beltway that stretched roughly from tacoma through the snoqualmie valley and then to everett would pull an estimated 29 000 cars off of interstate 5 but the state never acted on the idea instead focusing on other ways to relieve congestion on i 5 the idea drew such opposition that the king county council eventually amended the county comprehensive plan to specifically forbid such a roadway from cutting through the area from http www king5 com topstories stories nw_071504wabi605jk 2ffde016b html in other words the possibility of i 605 ever being planned let alone built died about 8 years ago is it therefore accurate to portray the road is going to be built when it is obvious that it is not

interest in improving this article hi i am not sure if anyone is watching this page but i wanted to introduce myself here as a representative on wikipedia for the motion picture association of america i work for the mpaa and my colleagues and i have noticed that this article is in bad shape we would like to assist volunteer editors in making this a better article both under wikipedia guidelines and as an informative page about mpaa for example i think it important to replace the history text which borrows sometimes word for word from the mpaa website with help from someone knowledgeable about wikipedia i am working on a better version of this section and i will hopefully be able to share that here soon for questions or thoughts about this page you can reply here or on my user talk page
leaving aside the fact that it outrageous abuse from the likes of oneguy and ta bu shi da yu that drove me to make personal attacks against these characters back when i first started editing wikipedia and leaving aside oneguy lies about why i stopped using the pename account i simply lost the password the fact remains that whatever personal attacks i might have made in the past does not mean that oneguy is now free to engage in whatever personal attacks he can conjure and no matter how many of his sysop friends ta bu shi da yu brings around here to help him and oneguy with their gangster like behaviour and abuse against me it will not change the fact that personal attacks are against wikipedia policy and that this policy applies to everyone including oneguy pename

perhaps the way forward is to include both the raw figures and also the rate per 100 000 these figures represent as for the conclusion i went for the conclusion in the introductory synopsis as it was a clear statement of the outcome of the research i did not add this study to the article but when i read it it is clear that it is relevant to the discussion as it provides evidence of correlation between abortion and suicide but as we all know correlation does not prove causation cheers

i m not saying you have to include everything but the quote from the guardian was more so positive than neutral and no you don t have to include the full quote but if you are going to talk about that particular quote then you should at least get enough what it was saying cause they didn t say she wasn t duly stretched they said one can say she wasn t duly stretched they also added this part to it knightley brings to the role fine sculpted features palpable intelligence and a nice mix of faux innocence and flirtiness even if she does not always know what to do with her hands she gives a perfectly creditable performance if you want to go for neutrality then you should ve added that part as well i mean it s still a neutral opinion and it still reflects the whole generally positive part also in talks of contrasting that bit you should add more to the quote quinten letts made in the daily mail which stated that she had the charisma of a gold fish so you have the positive with the negative this doesn t take away from the neutrality if anything it shows just how neutral the opinions were 74 105 159 145

that quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision which is not what the article is about the sentence may use the word foreskin but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision rather than the foreskin thus it is off topic and does not belong in the article the only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is nerve endings in the foreskin and that section by itself does not add much to the article allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire sexual effects of circumcision and medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to foreskin when taken to this extreme it quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article if readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed there are plenty of circumcision related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia and we already link to them from the foreskin article it appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article if it was just one or two sentences i would not have a basis for making this accusation but as we can see from this diff your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits so i am using that rather than listing them individually the amount of off topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial by the way since we are discussing content again i am happy to go back to the foreskin talk page so that other editors can participate in the conversation thanks for continuing our discussion i think we are getting somewhere again however i also note that you have now been reverted by two other editors indicating a lack of consensus for including the material in question so i am not sure if further discussion is necessary but i am happy to continue the discussion if you wish

this article currently says mccain came into conflict with higher ranking personnel he did not always obey the rules and that contributed to a low class rank 894 of 899 that he did not aim to improve 10 12 13 he did well in academic subjects that interested him such as literature and history but studied only enough to pass subjects he disliked such as math 5 mccain graduated in 1958 10 saying 894 of 899 seems okay to me saying instead that he was fifth from the bottom could mean a lot of different things for example if there were six people in his class it could mean he was ranked number two it important also to keep in mind that class standing was not solely a function of academic performace timberg americam odyssey 2007 printing page 54 the class rank also reflects the number of demerits among other tbhings

oversourcing hi i thought i should explain why i reverted the edit you made to warwick castle especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references i understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs however per wp v material challenged or likely to be challenged and all quotations must be attributed therefore i think it better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph moreover if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources so i am sorry to revert your changes but i am quite happy to discuss it if you still believe the references should be trimmed
hi and welcome but a caution hi welcome to wikipedia but please read the editing guidelines before you dive in and make significant edits i had to revert your work because we do not create galleries in good quality wikipedia articles wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a scrapbook and because you need to read articles before editing them particularly when you say something that is already said in the very next paragraph i do not mean to sound as harsh as this comes across but just wanted to give you a heads up on why your edits were reverted oh and you can fix those images so they are kept if you license them as public domain or under the gdfl license cc 2 0 is good too please do not be discouraged and keep your chin up you will figure it out talk

a reference of jesus cloak quote from the insight book the color of the cloak with which jesus christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the bible record with reference to this garment matthew said that the soldiers draped him with a scarlet cloak mt 27 28 while mark and john say that it was purple mr 15 17 joh 19 2 however instead of being a discrepancy such a variation in describing the garment s color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him that is according to his evaluation of color and he emphasized the garment s red hue john and mark subdued the red tint calling it purple purple can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red so mark and john agree with matthew that the garment was red to some extent of course background and light reflection could have given it different casts a body of water varies in color at different times depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time so when such factors are considered it is seen that the gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking roman soldiers clothed christ with on the last day of his human life
soundtrack i do not know if the format of this article has followed a pre set template for movies it appears very similar to other articles about hindi films however as a user i would find it very useful to have the names of the songs included in the article after all most hindi movies live or die on the strength of their soundtracks and people consider the songs quite important but i did not want to add a soundtrack section if it would violate a pre authorized agreed upon template if that is not the case i would be happy to create the section with the appropriate links

the consensus agreed on earlier was that the ntsb briefings are an authoritative source and rightly so they do not need to be separately quoted by 3rd party media press refs let alone by questionable blog postings or other online media and yeah i would expect people to actually have seen all ntsb briefings otherwise they have really no reason whatsoever to bother reviewing stuff here if anybody cannot be bothered to watch the ntsb briefings then please just read the transcripts frankly it is beyond me how you guys are tolerating this type of workflow and behavior even perceiving me stating that as an attack how can it be an attack to expect people to be familiar with the topic they are contributing to honestly all this goes to show the weaknesses and shortcomings of crowd sourced encyclopedia writing there no proper hierarchy and if there one it one where seniority and stylistic aptitude count more than a factual background yeah this is kinda disappointing
2012 the end of human history on this day 12 21 2012 will be a momentus day in the history of our planet and our civilization we will finally learn that humans are not alone in this universe and it will be discovered in a tremendous fasion we will learn that this universe is much more than anyone ever imagined we will shed the god myths of this world and know for the first time that humans are one of many species in this universe not just our galaxy but the whole of the universe the hate and war and injustices created by mans religion will be over the discovery will transport humans to another level never before imagined technology will advance far beyond what we believed capable this will be a time of fear for many losing ones god and finding out that it was all man made will create those that refuse to move forward and experience the true meaning of our existance many will try to impede our elevation to join the community of the universe and will try to attempt to demonize the truth and stop all of us from the truth many of humanity will choose to leave this world behind and travel to the stars in search of science truth logic and reason leaving those to their fate on planet earth

edit warring in light of joydiamond latest revert and angry edit summary in this article i left the following on her talk page you stated less than 24 hours ago that you were not going to edit war at the bouley page yet you are edit warring in fact this is day two of you choosing to edit war there in case you are not familiar with what edit warring really is you might want to read wp article on edit warring reverting the same thing several times is edit warring it also puts you in danger of violating 3rr please rather than just reverting stuff you do not like or agree with talk about it first on the talk page please do not just blindly revert and plase do not shout in your edit summaries or use edit summaries to vent anger frustration if all of this unproductive and unhelpful behavior continues i will have no choice but to get an administrator involved again and you can believe that even though they have not made themselves known yet there are admins already watching what is going on at the bouley article please just stop this uncivil uncooperative behavior and work within wp policies and guidelines if you do not you are putting yourself in danger of being banned and having the article locked from editing once again

i do not think humus sapiens is assuming the worst about the motivations of others my sense of it is that he just sees things differently and is perhaps more passionate and yes a bit self righteous about it than some of us factual accuracy there are at least three ways to view these events let a persecution of christians by some jews a institutional persecution of christians by jews let b christian persecution of jews first the perspective that we all reject the jews persecuted the christians and this justifies 2000 years of christian anti semitism this is a happened and a justifies b second the perspective that is i believe the mainstream position some jews persecuted the christians enough so that the christians viewed this or at least cast this as an institutional rejection of christianity culminating the hypothesized council of jamnia the polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored christian attitudes policies and behavior towards jews for the next 2000 years this anti semitism is rooted in the original conflict between jews and christians during the formative years of early christianity however most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti semitism this is a happened a was used to justify b but many people argue a does not justify b third the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing the nt account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the new testament or the writings of the church fathers note forgive me if i am overstating the position according to this perspective the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the nt authors or later interpreters of the nt authors for example it is possible that the incidents in the nt represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy later events post bar kokhba may have led to a re interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy this is a never happened a happened a was used to justify b but many people argue a does not justify b i believe that all of these perspectives yes even the first one should be presented in the article we should give due weight to each perspective citing sources who support each view finally i think that we are agreed that we should not say jews persecuted the christians but rather according to the nt jews persecuted the christians if this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy

an event in this article is a april 30 selected anniversary may be in html comment a question has been bugging me from the time the first us military advisors stepped in to vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all us troops in 1973 the ussr and china repeatedly warned kennedy johnson and nixon not to cross the dmz and directly invade north vietnam that seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the north but my question is were the south vietnamese forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade north vietnam did ussr and china ever warn the south not to invade the north considering the u s coordination with and funding for arvn i am sure that they would take south vietnamese ground forces in north vietnam much the same way they would take marines the only crossing of the dmz that occurred was american bombing raids probably not but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off 23 july 2005 it hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade s v from doing anything but i agree with cjk the limited competence of the arvn in offensive operations seems well established in the historical record e g the offensive in laos talk 03 04 2005 july 24 utc the forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the south and its dissident south vietnamese were often the target of u s bombing keep in mind that the terms north and south were circumstantial and not actually representative of the demographic split north and south often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war which american soldiers for example found to be not the reality many perhaps most people in the democratic south were pro independence despite the western allied ethnic catholic elite hence any use of north and south carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts t i do not know what you are talking about we were discussing whether or not the soviets or chinese would react if south vietnam sent its forces to invade north vietnam 24 july 2005 i dont know what you are talking about well it would really help if you did wouldnt it t well maybe you should not bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion 25 july 2005 i would just like to commend the recent additions to the article actually to my understanding there were still many rescue raids of captured pows or commando attacks that were conducted by either u s commandos or the biet dong quan the arvn equivalent against the north during the war it an honour to meet celebrities like you trey and parker stone i appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the vietnam war page well others watching this page are quite capable of rving marxist language and pov it seems and would rving capitalist language and pov be ok with you t i do not know what capitalist language means but if it existed and was pov then i would have no problems with its reversion we were actually talking about a full scale attack by south vietnam not a raid 24 july 2005 let assume the south vietnamese army without us troop support did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the dmz in to the north would the chinese and or ussr intervene and play the defending an ally card for the north exactly like how we did for the south i know this is a hypothetical assumption but still it irrelevant because the arvn was never able to operate well without u s assistance so answering your hypothetical if that did happen active intervention in the form of chinese or soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the pavn superior capabilities if we had somehow managed to make the arvn into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over north vietnam then yes i would expect the pla army in china to intervene just like they had in north korea but american go

discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations hi i observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for japanese monarchs and royals it seems that these weeks there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots one example is whether to standardize thai royal persons of course thai and japanese are totally different for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc and should probably be as separate as eastern are in relation to european royalty naming i think japanese naming and thai naming could end up to different conventions and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that however discussions may give new ideas and or give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning would you see the arguments and votes at wikipedia talk manual of style thailand related articles and do you have any opinion

i understand your logic but i disagreed with your position for a different reason the point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view if we are to assume good faith here we should believe they did actually see the full texts cited them and provided the links to google books as the best available online target it better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all would not you agree however this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these cites what it does mean is that to be able to question them you will have to have something better than logically enhanced mind wanderings such as one above which brings me back to my original recommendation find the books read them and if they indeed are not acceptable as references remove the sentences in question if in turn anyone questions the results of your analysis well they will have to get their own copy of the books on their own after which you can go through the pleasure of discussing both sides interpretations of the sources on the article talk page instead of accusing the other party of what may or may not have been the case of or syn plain negligence to do a proper research yo 17 31 march 30 2009 utc

you foolishly defer to quantity rather than quality in your opening statement it is about the quality of the sources not how many there are and seeing as the most verifiable sources from your point of view have already been put forward here ad nauseum your case that there is widely accepted verifiable and neutrally based evidence of the late senator neo conservative legacy is seriously flawed the citations you highlight at the forefront of your case are agenda based so heaven knows how superfluously irrelevant the other sources are your very deference to the quantity of sources in your opening gambit reflects the tenuous nature of your argument i refer you back to my vegetarian analogy the tide of truth is flowing against you desist from your misinformed unreliable agenda based pigeon holing of the late senator or risk being swept away to the sea of ignorance i refuse to let the late senator name become besmirched and mislabelled by a case built on subjective sources those who propagate such skewed sources on wp some would suggest are merely the agents of ignorance

what the guy clearly has consistently destroyed your arguments why do you feel the need when presented with such a massive body of evidence pointing quite clearly towards to contrary concerning the phrase in question to argue against it and then when finally beaten claim that further debate would violate wikipedia policies you quite clearly are a militantly pro atheist pro nietzschean fool who cannot accept anyone challenging his and therefore irrefutable view of the world just goes to show though you are just as dogmatic as the priests from the pulpit you so deride

i am encouraged by your feedback let me clear it up a bit first my version is written basically with paul graham article on this topic in my mind i think that article is neither an undue appraisal nor an unfair dismissal of the term and i think it would be a good and neutral starting point for me when i re write the lead according to that article web 2 0 can be boiled down into three things democracy ajax and focus on user this is how i structure the lead sentence democracy ie architecture of participation in tim o are illy words and folksonomy in realisation and user focus in the first part and better ui powered with ajax in the second specific replies as follows lengthy list agree although the current version also features a long list as well perhaps we can break down that clause into two like this that put emphasis on allowing users to share and collaborate information online in new ways as part of the service presented in a user friendly interactive and often ajax enabled user interface collaborate information my wrong let preserve the order in the current version ie collaborate and share information folksonomy see my point re democracy and architecture of participation above i do believe that this is an important feature that distinguish web 2 0 from the old a platform built in as part of the service that allows users to actively contribute to the grouping and ranking of contents you wo not have that pre web 2 0 even the readers ranking at amazon com was initially a secondary feature cluttering the lead please see if the revised version above would make it better presented and as i have mentioned above the original version suffers from the same problem as well focus on what web 2 0 is i believe this is what i am doing with the revised version the current version simply mentions too much of o are illy media but the term has evolved far beyond their reach and control and i do believe the revised version does sufficiently address the fact that it has become a buzzword in the marketing sense

if i was a new reader and i read your version i would just end up being more confused and if we were doing reveal the details as they occur chronologically then the torch returning and throwing the vision origin in question would be written after the bit about the government dismantling him and not before was the idea of the vision body originally being the torch a retcon the only thing i would really consider to be a retcon was byrne trying to undo everything in the 1990s with west coast should we write something like byrne tried retconning the vision being the original human torch by bring the human torch back and byrne has stated on his forum how he never liked the idea of the two being the same should that be stated as well and then how busiek tried to unretcon it in avengers forever
the first example is not a fallacy because no wrong conclusions have been drawn and it is even questionably if it is an argumentum ad baculum since ehm no arguments have been made just simple statements the same goes for the second example it seems that all the presented supposed instances of argumentum ad baculum as being a logical fallacy are not valid because no one actually draws any wrong conclusions and only if this would happen one could speak of fallacy 62 226 12 183

this conflict is called civil war by some but officially it not yet everyone acknowledges it may become and this practically any moment imagine for example if the sunnis assassinated sistani the un people are neutral experts and they say it islamic extremism and they were actually hit in one of the insurgent attacks unrelated to the sectarian violence talking about being there you are just an amatour and the un would not even ask you for your opinion get over it problem is people can go here and think the so much talked for years now sliding towards escalating into civil war is declared and going on and get confused this is misleading to say it mildly if you are aware of that this is vandalising when i first came there it was even worse the insurgency including attacks against coalition forces was confused with the sectarian violence probably copy pasted without thinking oh and do not talk silly crazy about some flowers and music anyway i will answer seriously the main articles for you are iraq war iraqi insurgency sectarian violence in iraq as the articles titles alone say there is war insurgency and violence going on there each one connected to another well iraqi music is actually too there are also multiple sub articles plenty of these some with the names like massacre as for your bloodbath there even articles on the casualties here you can go back if the civil war officially started that is declared by the other side the shia militias the government of iraq or the un the media will start calling it by this name too

oppose again it inaccurate to say its tv channel when it a tv network furthermore abc may not be advertising or is being commonly referred to as the american broadcasting company in 2012 but that has not always been the case even sites like msnbc still have a american broadcasting company on msnbc page and it still is officially named as such so i would prefer to keep it as per option 1 of wp ncdab when there is another term or more complete name that is equally clear and is unambiguous that may be used

rotten tomatoes wp mosfilm and wp rtmc have several things to say about rotten tomatoes rotten tomatoes started roughly in 2000 for films before then the score from rotten tomatoes is often deemphasized and put at the end of the critical response section as it is done in the case of this article weasel words like mostly should be avoided when the wording can be specific and the wording should be improved to avoid this if you look at the reviews for goldfinger you will see they are all dated post 2000 this can be specifically stated and vague weasel words avoided an editor stated that the percentage given by rotten tomatoes is not the score and that the score was 8 4 but this was clearly an incorrect description rotten tomatoes describes 8 4 as the rating average it would probably be good to include the 8 4 rating average if editors feel the rotten tomatoes percentage is somehow dishonest keep comments on relevant article talk pages do not make comments personal talk pages if you want to start a discussion on the talk page then better to actually start it than telling someone else to start it 109 79 100 242

help sought hi there been going through some rough phase of a wiki career so a bit of guidance from you on the following would be of help i have a lingering doubt and i wish to be clear before i resume editing in case to avoid further disputes is it acceptable to cite references of a different language into en wiki i find it hard to get them the reliable references in english for some articles also when can we have videos into an article and does it matter from which site we take them from for instance i intended to add these youtube links as means of external links directing to the respective speeches but in the end i figure i had done something i had not supposed to it would help if you could clarify regarding both i find referencing kind of not uniform across wikipedia almost 70 80 of the blps are poorly sourced but yet i find it amusing to get involved in such disputes talk contr mail

most of the article is simply an exercise in editorial vanity by a few one in particular self centred and obsessive editors the result is a very low quality wikipedia article as you can see from the broken quality logo at the top of this talk page certainly one of the worst focused on a historical person 75 of it could be removed with no consequence except a vast improvement in encyclopedic usefulness
oh come on now how can you possibly justify this unsourced widly undue and total wp recentism i do not know how you can justify putting distribution in the article in the first place but even if it were included you have restricted it to the american comic book industry in 2016 ignoring non american comic books comic strips graphic novels webcomics etc etc etc as well as the history of the direct market and the system that preceded it can you please explain why you are so desperate to fiddle with the article it does not seem your motivation is to improve it or to find out even the basics of what you are adding gobble

if you were actually arguing the value judgement by providing alternative merc olc systems there would actually be a sound reason for compromise few some many most widely have common sense meanings and are not in general in any way harmful nor even contentious as would be first last notable nonnotable best worst and others no i see no reason to compromise unless the poster has an argument that the observation widely used is blatantly fallacious or harmful to the article

i think that we all have our point of view as far as any given subject is concerned the point is that we should try not to show it when we write an article but it impossible in my opinion to require that only people with absolutely no pov whatsoever can edit an article such people are merely not interested in the subject for instance i have no pov at all as far as jayant kaikini is concerned but that probably due to the fact that before i pressed the random article button i was totally unaware of his existence

the extent of your homophobic ignorance is genuinely startling it has been clear from the outset that you have no contact with the academic world but even informed laypersons are aware that queer studies is a standard term for scholarly programs at many universities and that queer is a term of choice by many individuals with same sex lifestyle preferences your preposterous statement that gay encyclopedias are not considered an authoritative source here is simply laughable your personal hatreds and phobias are your own problem jack and are not a basis for censoring this article if you have an issue with the encyclopedia gbltq as a source you should deal with it at the relevant wikipedia article glbtq com i have once again restored the sexuality section if you deface it again i will refer your homophobic vandalism to wikipedia lgbt project

e c in this case the discussion was inefficient because you failed to do even minimal due diligence and try to find the answer to what deletion discussion yourself which you could have trivially done avoiding a waste of both my time and yours after e c the answer is that this discussion is inefficient because of blind stubborness on your part you are wrong and yet incapable of backing off as for the a in agw read global warming global warming is the increase in the average temperature of earth near surface air and oceans since the mid 20th century and its projected continuation if you want it to mean something else you may be looking for climate change perhaps the question should be what exactly are you hoping to achieve here you are certainly going to have to actually understand the subject rather better than you are demonstrating if you want to make anything better

i am sorry you had to wait so long are so frustrated and feel that way the only reason why i decided to review the article was out of pity 2 months is a very long wait as far as i am concerned just for a ga review and btw i am well aware of how common law is taught but thank you for assuming otherwise it is not a matter of how it is taught but the failure to include the opinions of other reputed minds in the field whether it be in the form of lawyers judges or former judges all of whom are generally the only reputed authors in law as i would have expected you to know perhaps you are under the impression that no other textbook or essay refers to and discusses this case beyond merely reproducing it it is indeed a shame you are giving up so easily because unless you are suggesting common law by coincidence is somehow completely different for you in comparison to everyone else i see no basis for your decision again i apologise for the wait and frustration that you feel at this moment for seeing your article failed but i well understand how things are done good luck
you do realize the lists come from the same location and it has changed very slightly since i answered the above questions the point is still the same the picture is not a decoration talk if the book was not discussed in the article you would be right the image would just be a decoration that happens to show what she looks like the fact that the book is discussed in the article means including the image is fair use since the image can be used on the article it not merely decoration since it is useable in the article including it to also illustrate browne herself is a beneficial aspect of these circumstances

wikipedia is not a court hearing transcript well this directly contradicts wikipedia policy itself where when reputable sources contradict one another then you are required to present the differing viewpoints with clarity if this turns out to be like a court hearing transcript transcript so be it but you are misunderstanding my use of he says we do not need to specifically do that if the context makes it clear anyway npov weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence however when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence the core of the npov policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page work for balance that is describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources and give precedence to those sources that are most reliable and verifiable i have a suggestion i will write the ernst and al viewpoint and you do the other i can do mine first

july 2013 utc starcheers does not say anything about banning stylization he she says that the inclusion of the is not required allow me to explain why the inclusion of is different to the inclusion of a letter stands for one of two things its a symbolic representation of the word number or it is a social media mechanism hash tagging most prominently used on twitter if the name of the song was read and sung as hashtag that power but was written as thatpower then including the is detrimental to the name however the name of the song as per what is song and said outloud is that power therefore the inclusion of the is for the social media mechanism rather than to represent the word number as a result the reason to include the is stylistic i e its a stylistic choice for the copyright the copyright being legally registering the song is a recorded work but it is not pronounced in the work nor is it part of the title the inclusion of i in iphone is not stylistic it is part of the copyright and part of the name thus including the i is detrimental to the work in question as a phone and an iphone are two different things whereas thatpower and thatpower are one in the same as in this context the has no meaning talk 19 50 21

jack insistent plagiarism despite having been repeatedly cautioned against plagiarizing from the book mythological women jack seems hell bent on inserting his plagiarism into the article while simultaneously refusing to allow quotations from the same source that would cure the problem since the only rationale jack has offered for these actions is that he claims to be ignorant of both copyright law and plagiarism conventions it seems the only way to resolve the problem is to restore the article to the neutral stub first advanced as a solution by on may 17 2008 i have accordingly done so with a minor correction regarding the number of prof motz scholarly publications

yeah i take your silence as you saying that i am right but you are too afraid to admit it
hi other editors might see it differently for you are right there is a certain amount of subjectivity to this but you are best argument is on the first criteria you mention the co state championship i do not believe would qualify and i am not sure the grand master competition would either there not a lot of media about that either in addition that claim is uncited so if you hang your hat on his being a finalist in that you will need to provide proof oh and did he finish 2nd if not that would not qualify anyway the second criteria he clearly does not meet since he neither won nor was nominated the third criteria would have to be about a network television show or a show which was syndicated not some local show i did some quick searches and really could not find much about him the best article i found was this magnolia music studio but even that only mentions him in passing do you know of any articles about him in mainstream papers the denver post denver tribune rocky mountain news or one of the nashville papers that would really help i have to say the article is written not too badly there are some formatting issues section headings raw links in the text that a no no and some prose issues very short paragraphs but so much better than most first time efforts i wish i could have found more sources but sometimes when something is so specialized it difficult i hope i have helped

hungarian names for places before 1867 hi as the official language of the kingdom of hungary was latin until 1867 using hungarian names for cities etc before this date is anachronistic since the latin name that was used at the time can scarcely be found we should list all the places with their modern names thank you
my interpretation is what it is as is yours
i came here because the papers are full of the use of this word in the sense of terrorism of course the first paragraph should say its other usage exists but it should also mention that is is used in terrorism that is what the papers talk about when they talk about it readers like me come here to understand that context why would we censor that out of the first paragraph the readers want knowledge so what if editor x wants to deprive them of the knowledge this should not be about editor x hiding from me and other readers the very information we want to find out i was very disappointed to see that some people want to use this to hide that information of course it is important it is in the headlines for this reason even if mangy people used it this week to pray it was used instead in headlines because it was a battle cry
silent consensus about reality this phrase stopped me dead in my tracks silent consensus about reality perhaps the phrase silent consensus about reality has a clear meaning in the jargon of some school of thought but i have never encountered it before and have no idea what it refers to i would like to see this re written or expanded so that it comprehensible by the average person or removed altogether since i have no idea what it means i am not able to re write or expand it and i am loathe to just delete it since it has survived many other edits and therefore presumably means something to others the phrase was added by special contributions 85 127 205 253 85 127 205 253 at 2009 01 31t03 27 25 can that person clarify what they intended to say can anyone else offer an explanation
i am willing to take criticism for my edits and i am willing to back down if i am wrong my statement was in good faith but it also true that i made the statement on my own authority without citing a source however my statement was really no more weaselly than the statement it was intended to answer so i have reverted to my last version because i have criticisms of impumozhi edits that i think are valid but removed both of the weasel statements because i concede that your criticism of some of my wording is valid if you believe that i was impolite or uncivil to impumozhi or anyone else then please let me know what i did wrong so that i may tender my apology

you are mistaken the article was about the internet release of an episode of merlin the article purpose it to announce the release discuss its quality and discuss the episode itself you are mistaken in interpreting it as a links database again the link was not to a site hosting illegal content but to one featuring an article regarding an episode in the comments for the article links to content of questionable legal status were posted so at best there are two degrees of separation between what i wrote in the talk page for merlin and the content in question my intent was not to advertise i honestly wanted to illustrate what i meant by online excitement for the show the editor that has attempted to dispute this does not understand my intentions despite multiple attempts to explain it to him or her if you are in fact that same editor then i thank you for finally signing in again after reviewing the policy page you provided me with i can say again that what i have done is not a violation it is not a torrent site as you like to say regardless i think we have finally come to a compromise on the situation i would like the posts to remain unchanged as my inquiry into online viewership is a legitimate one and one that if answered could improve the quality of the article 6 million viewers does not do this show justice
just to say again that you have done a very good job on this bishonen as for the aftermath maybe we could tack on some of the more usable useful portions from the old version as an interim measure before you or a n other provide us with a possibly definitive account just thinking that the users of wikipedia would benefit from some info on monsieur hubert and the monument etc

the article itself says that is has not been concluded who built the mound you have already conceded middle east links to the region by admitting the x is found in the ancient americas which is already confirmed by bioarcheology the x came from n which came from west asia largely found around present day turkey and throughout the region one of the odin ancestors came from the area of modern day turkey and the x has been found in similarities to groups both in sweden and ancient america while the adena mound sites have been found to be similar to those found in sweden the high level of x found along the atlantic artic travel routes suggest it could have came to the continent that way but that is for archeologists to determine see who built the ancient stone architecture of canada and new england richard thornton august 22 2010

populism as a positive term and a critique of critics since i wrote last fall several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred the south african intellectual and scholar xolela mangcu has entered the global discussion building on a highly visible lecture he gave in cape town for the wolpe trust last june 18 jacob zuma on the politics of grievance http www wolpetrust org za dialogue2007 mangcupaper pdf in this lecture mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of populism that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites he developed this argument in his weekly column in business day december 7 2007 drawing on gianna pomata scholarship on the history of populism in europe and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of enlightenment rationalism and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures he also makes a number of parallels with south african journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book to the brink universityof kwa xulu natal 2008 sure to create a major discussion in african academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to steve biko the founder of the black consciousness movement for an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http book co za bookchat topic php id 2079 as far as mike huckabee populism is concerned the piece by david kirkpatrick in the new york times january 13 2008 young evangelicals embrace huckabee has a detailed discussion of why many catholics and evangelicals see him as populist the article among many in the american election season is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the us and europe in the us the term on balance clearly has positive associations otherwise major candidates like edwards and huckabee would not use it in self description this is a product most likely of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers cooperatives new deal reform and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist boyte 13 january

copyright violations lightbringer if you restore these copyright violations again i will block you freemasonrywatch org is quite clearly not a commercial content provider but a personal webpage blog therefore your justification is completely bogus in fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a wikipedia arbitrator in addition to the previous complaint i made against you about your anti catholic hate filled username the epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of hisuserame mason boyne presbyterian bigot and orange lodgemember says to his wife did you know morag that if you spell pope backwards you get epop which is a four letter word beginning with e like evil you see it all there in the bible if you just shoogle the letters around a bit the fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between pro occult and anti occult editors shows your complete disregard for wikipedia guidelines and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a wikipedia arbitrator letters on the masonic institution by president john quincy adams originally published 1847 t r marvin boston massachusetts preface it is now twenty years since there sprung up in the united states an earnest and at times a vehement discussion of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of free and accepted masons the excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made had the effect at least for a time if not permanently to check the farther spread of that association the legislative power of some of the states was invoked and at last actually interposed to prevent the administration of extra judicial oaths including of course all such as were constantly taken in the masonic order this was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached it did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the order or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system from the moment of the adoption of a penal law deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of the apprehension of further danger from masonry began to subside at this day the subject has ceased to be talked of the attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things until at last it may be said that few persons are aware of the fact provided it be not especially forced upon their notice that not only freemasonry continues to exist but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature if not of its unjustifiable obligations not merely live but greatly flourish in the midst of them fully aware of this state of things a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations without cherishing the remotest desire even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation of reviving an old excitement they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the freemason oath such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the honorable john quincy adams but although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination this great deficiency it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to a desirable object to supply they accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume not as a matter of sale but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution and first of all they deemed

unblock i am not vandalizing i was merely deleting a trivial and unnoteworthy piece of information it is trivial and unnoteworthy because as is explained in wikipedia manual of style writing about fiction it explicitly says that throwaway comments and jokes are not to be used in articles the creationist thing is clearly a throwaway joke as it makes no other appearances in the same context anywhere else in the series not only that but it is not even spoken orally just written down on a piece of cardboard on the talk page someone said that it would be easier to believe me if i were deleting the entire iq statement but the retardation itself is not trivial or throwaway it returns in to live and die in dixie this makes it a recurring theme a la brian novel and ernie the giant chicken if the creationist joke were to return in the same context elsewhere in the show then it would be noteworthy wikipedia is not an indiscriminate source of information just because something is true does not mean it belongs this whole block is founded of the misconception that i am only deleting it because i am offended by it supposedly this is because i called the term offensive but i will have you know that i am actually a creationary evolutionist which is different from a creationist when i said it was offensive i merely meant that creationists would be offended by it besides even if i am offended by it i gave a good compelling reason for why it should be deleted anyway it seems to me that ctjf83 merely wants to be a bully

why compare only to windows 2000 features as this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion i have decided to address it here windows xp is in the unique position compared to all other windows releases i can think of of being at the convergence point of two separate windows product lines that of windows nt and the old ms dos based windows 9x however the core code in xp is based on the former and not the latter hence xp has an internal version number of 5 1 while windows 2000 has one of 5 0 among numerous other things a list of every single feature included in windows me the last of the ms dos based versions but not in xp would be quite long indeed and also quite pointless because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures there also the fact that comparisons between the other list of features removed in windows articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult

hi wally not sure if you are picking things up on my talk page so talking with you here thanks for your rapid response proper thanks given on my talk page where you left feedback the user astrotrain is still vandalising my work to try and shake him off my tail i have given him notice that he is violating trade marks the word astrotrain is a trade mark of katara in japan but that user still persists in attacking my work using that illegal user name i think agreement has been reached with other users by removing all personal links from my image pages pending a decision from wikipedia image licencing specialists and you as a mediator even though i have not mentioned your user name one user alr has been very good in tidying up the presentation of one of my images after initally attacking me but astrotrain is just deleting my work anyway i do not know how to proceed with recommending the blocking of astrotrain but that user is violating international law on the use of trade marks and possibly exposing wikipedia to legal action from katara lawers astrotrain needs to be blocked for legal reasons but it would probably also be useful for that user to go through the process of starting again that user has a documented history of destroying other peoples work and holding back the development of wikipedia on several articles there is a need for that user to re evaluate its contribution to wikipedia and personal agenda i wish astrotrain well with a new user name anyway it occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographers in the world many many much more competent than me who would be willing to release their prized pictures to wikipedia for free wikipedia use only much of the world is lacking in education and information the world poorest only hope in the short term is technology leap e g skipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the internet with wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information but not making pictures and information available from the professionals ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information this will not help them and on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information photographers often appear an arrogant breed but deep down they are artists caring people perhaps wikipedia should be calling on photographers around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and wikipedia hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful des

scientific creationism in the opening sentence i am a bit confused regarding the opening sentence and why it uses both creation science and scientific creationism i wanted to bring it up here first before editing in case there was some sort of debate or discussion that already happened in the hopes i could get clarification on why we use the phrase scientific creationism at all aside from a few books with that title it clearly not a commonly used synonym for creation science check the google test after you remove any references to scientific creationism book titles additionally scientific creation as a unique term does not seem to have any sort of definition and as such just seems pointless and redundant to use in the opener

i do not consider it ridiculous to support wikipedia policy against original research as such i do not consider it ridiculous to ask for a source to be provided for unsourced information regardless of how reasonable it may seem to you or others i am not claiming that she is not iranian or that she is a slave but merely raising the possibility to you so that you realize that we need to use sources on wikipedia so how about you just find a source that explicitly describes the woman pictured as persian it as simple as that assuming that you derived your statement from sources but forgot to note them this will however be much more difficult if your claim is indeed original research as i suspect if this is the case then for the future please do not add original research to wikipedia zereshk thanks in advance for compliance

introduction the article hi new poster here ive been following the article for a few weeks i have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas the controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu in japan and sgi international with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from after looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that most likely will be a cite war the benefit is two fold first the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about that buddhism what they do where they came from etc etc and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them similar to the anti christianity criticism article and others this is the most npov solution i can up with also having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace i have seen some demonstrations nothing on a global scale or read about the political party has anyone btw secondly in the split article section the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect its an article about how the sect is impacting the world it just seems a bit more accurate hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc thoughts

you see the problem arrisses in that most people dont see how just something else is a fact when you give no reasoning just like you made a comment about my statement its only fair that i ask how are they not nu metal when they share the same musical propertys how are they omething else when they fit the description of nu metal wesley already knows that the genre needs a description otherwise its violating the policy about drawing a distinction without drawing a distinction alls i ask for as so the article isnt deleted is that it has a defination otherwise its effectivly just a list that goes on about the progenitorial history of nu metal

user bryce_carmony you blocked this guy for edit warring his response has been to resume the war except that instead of adding the word originally all over the same article he now removing it and arguing consensus
there is one other thing that just occured to me an encyclopedia deals in facts not in speculation about what a given person may or may not be i doubt you would find a list like this in any other encyclopedia not necessarily a reason to remove it wikipedia has lots of good stuff not in other encyclopedias and it would be inappropriate to have a list like warning signs your neighbor may be a serial killer or how to tell if your best friend is gay it may be better to find a site that has a list like this you could probably find something like it on the apa web site a good source and provide a link at the bottom of the page i also am not comfortable replacing factual with common sense thank you by the way for avoiding an edit war i generally think it best to move stuff like this to talk pages until resolved because it promotes action and it moves possibly false information out of the article 05 36 aug 29 2004 utc

hermetic qabbalah your edits to the hermetic qabbalah page are really quite over the top firstly it is policy not to make a whole series of small edits but to make as few as possible it makes it very hard to follow the changes when you make a lot of small edits one after the other please try to abide by this in the future while i will agree that this article needs more referencing most of the things which you have added fact tags to are so well known as to be beyond dispute having said this i will be adding some appropriate references in the next day or so however some things e g hermetic qabbalah being a precursor to wicca etc are not as you say bold statements but rather established fact also removing all the categories is not fixing overcategorization i will agree that one or two of them were a bit spurious but certainly not all of them please take a couple of deep breaths and think carefully before editing pages when you are obviously not well versed in the topic
