i prefer to let the guy ask me.
i suffer through verbal abuse from my wife.
you will have more friends than you want.
it's nice that you get to see pictures of who you are talking to.
i need to know what to do.
love me, love me. oh dear god love me!
it would not be a word. it would be a singing opera.
i like my life with the exception of her yelling and using swear words.
i know how it is.
does he have a favorite sports team?
while you are away, he will do it again and again.
i suggest saying "look, this is not working out for me anymore".
no sister, i do not think so.
then kiss her, brother; that works every time.
women mature faster than men and some men never mature.
after that i never bought her another gift.
you can attend you class with her if you would like.
it will happen when you choose to be wealthy and powerful.
please don't beg for love, money or respect.
you will definitely know when you are in love.
do not base your relationship on money or material items.
what if someone asked this question: "how can i get my boyfriend to notice me?"
i am unable to sign in at the chat room.
if you just live with a friend, i call that friend with rights.
it is hard to tell from this question, but it seems like you are trying to change yourself, and that is a bad idea.
i don't know what he is thinking, sometimes we just sit and watch.
go to france and see for yourself.
she was aware i was previously dating someone that was married.
you should not let what other people say bother you.
i wish you good fortune no matter what course you take.
the caveat is that you and i are not married, and this is acceptable to me.
i recommend that high school students do not date anyone who is still in middle school.
if this tactic is not successful with one person, then just keep trying with others.
you may want to inform this man that if he makes one more phone call to you, it will result in the loss of his job.
after that, a gentleman got involved who changed everything!
i am willing to do so, as long as the four of you are as well!
contrary to what other say, they are not born that way.
i think you should try a different kind of female.
she and tend to cross paths every now and then.
you should say yes, if you love him.
it would be wise to separate from him as soon as possible.
i have learned to love myself which is something i was unable to do in the past.
i have trouble meeting girls because i attend a school with only boys.
please talk and do not rush your words
you should go and play with your dolls
do you talk to that person often?
with no level of committment, is that concidered double dating?
it is not the size of the breast that is attractive, but how well one carries herself.
you simply have to do that which makes her happy.
yes, though i suppose it depends on the vows.
perhaps you should be asking where the sexually transmitted diseases are in kay's.
that means you do not have to antagonize her any longer.
in that case, ask her to accompany you to the next school dance or to see a movie.
is something happening with your friend, or with hers?
but, do not mistake my meaning, do not give way and become submissive. find a compromise.
it may not succeed if you are truly cowardly, and therefore become more fearful than the woman is.
i believe that wound depend on whether her and her husband have an open marriage.
she wishes to enjoy herself, and that is why she has entered into an affair with you. do not take this relationship too seriously.
just say that for the moment you just want to be friends.
that is because they are just not doing their job!
it would be good to get out of there now while it is possible.
yes, that is true if they are addicted sexually to it, but that would mean they need to see a sex therapist.
personally, i think young men are sexy, as long as they are more than 25 years old.
it is because boys are not mature enough yet to know what they want or what they have.
five feet tall and 135 pounds sounds very good to me.
please seek mental help from a professional.
if that is true i would not be surprised if he is unfaithful again.
if he went after another womant he obviously did not care, it is not all her fault.
if she has yet to bring it up, then it does not need to be talked about.
perhaps you could check there first.
if you are desiring one of your own, you should try yahoo personals. don't you agree?
first, you need to be nice and wait on them.
go on. talk to him and do not hide anything.
the same qualities you look for in a gentleman.
young women who ask young men out are ten times more successful than girls who do not.
so the simple man fell in love one time with his wife and claims it was real love.
do not retaliate, you should not devalue yourself to her level.
cafes, coffeehouses, malls are all places you could find a girl, depending on what type you are are interested in.
if he loves you, he'll appreciate whatever you give him.
since i'm a prude, i'll say marriage.
i, for one, am nothing like that.
you should love them the way they are.
i married too many times for love before. now it depends upon how much money we are speaking about!
nicely done, i know she'll definitely love it.
his father, meanwhile, is obsessing over his new love interest.
firstly, that's not a friend.
i hope you'll answer me.
my friends agree with me as well.
i say love who you love, race shouldn't be an issue.
you shouldn't go any further with this man, please?
utilize terminology that reminds him of better times in the past.
do you have any idea where i should go meet them?
if you really like her, go as a group at first.
"closer" performed by nine inch nails is the most sexually relevant song ever to exist.
they are committing the very actions they accuse you of.
besides the previously mentioned advice, merely act as you normally would.
be amusing and slightly arrogant.
merely inform him of your feelings of not liking him in the manner he desires and tell him not to revisit the subject.
see it like that and forget about him or her.
women want a man who will never cheat on them.
something to look at or play with.
my dress was long wit ha fifteen foot train!
you will be happy when you communicate and be yourself.
you still got the wrong answer, even though you thought that you had the right answer.
last time i was injured, so it's just me this time.
call him and talk with him about the matter.
most likely, you'll never find a significant other that likes you for your personality, or even if you like him.
just explain to them that you love them very much.
it would have to be someone that i'm familiar with.
do you even know her? she doesn't feel the same way about you. you should talk with her.
now, do not let the other person read it.
obviously, you should make sure that the best friend wouldn't have a problem with it.
i heard that it doesn't really matter. what does matter, however, is how you use it.
you should date for someone you find is attractive as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
it is not as bad as everyone makes it sound.
you will like each other better if you sleep together.
also, you probably should not have a girlfriend.
both, i am just guessing that it matters because of the levels of comfort and perhaps psychological reasons for men.
maybe you can relive that, then make it even better.
being in love never hurts, but losing love does.
my best friend had many reasons why she didn't approve of my boyfriend.
if i were in your shoes i would buy him something he enjoys, like a sweatshirt or something of the sort.
get together with your friends and have a great time!
yes, the reason why you proposed is because she would be worth the new thought.
if you need help ask just ask him for it. i think he would rather help than get yelled at and stuff.
the best way to handle something like this is to just say it.
we need someone who can take care of us in the long run. men are big babies.
girls like it when you compliment their breasts.
guys just do not notice that girls have bowel movements.
i do not like the thought of something that untraditional, but, of course, it is okay.
i can only speak for myself, a fun-loving guy.
think about what it is you want from a wife.
maybe you should try it.
you can find people online or where you live.
get it out in the open!
she might be more shy than you know because that is nonthreatening.
i love jesse, too, even though he is dating katie cassidy.
you can buy a nice blanket to keep you warm.
a good friend will be a good listener who will not hurt your feelings.
if he is a great person, his skin color should not matter.
on the other hand, it is possible to find a new best friend- there is an abundance out there.
i am unaware if it is possible.
there is no difference between ages if the intellect is similar.
please come and assist me girls.
i do hope you enjoy my ideas!
message me and if you have any trouble contacting me, try the number five.
if you are attracted to him, i think the best plan of action is to ask him out on a date and attempt to spend some more time with him.
ultimately, it is important to trust yourself and plan your actions accordingly.
you might want to go over to her house and explain that you have more things to discuss with her.
husbands can be just as quick to erection as men much younger than them.
god has all power, why not love him?
the age is not an issue, we are from different races.
actions speak louder than words.
i have to follow my instinct.
you give me reason and power. will you love me?
in addition to skin color difference, we have an age issue.
there is more to love than just saying "i love you".
what do you do if you are in love with a girl on the internet?
that is my personal opinion.
if she is happy, you shouldn't let your jealousy get in the way.
i always get stuck with someone who resembles a lumberjack!
they do it because they love each other.
it's too bad you aren't aware of how he ended his relationship with his daughter's mother.
you can meet another girl since there are so many available!
do you believe i should believe this individual, or leave him?
for what reason would you purchase the cow if the milk itself is free?
given the game is serious, however, do not get pregnant.
nonetheless, you are a kind individual to be around.
whether it is the first time or the hundredth time, please use protection.
as i have said before, finding that special person just happens; you cannot plan it.
if there is one think girls like, it is a man who smells nice.
look at my question - i posted that i need help as well.
mature men could not care less whether or not their girlfriend is a virgin.
it could be a trust thing as my mother is like that when my step dad goes away.
he has a family so allow him to reconcile with his lady.
all is well, god already has the right person for you.
i am undecided.
some guys do not care about females.
he has a baby. let him work things out with his girlfriend.
your situation is fine. you are waiting for the right person or you tend not to trust people.
first, please explain how it is possible that he had no choice.
i am somewhat stuck in the middle.
the reason is that a man will lie, cheat, and steal to get you into bed.
that is if you still care about me.
i really enjoy gotham city.
i question whether or not i should just cut girls out of my life.
you are not in love with me, you just needed a friend at the time.
if she tells you that you should know that she does then disregard her statement.
he had an extroverted personality, while i have an introverted personality.
you have nothing to lose because the formulation of this plan already ensures your doom.
the right person for you is out there.
you are in the right place at this moment.
i love derrieres, so please dance to your heart's content!
he is outgoing and i am quiet.
you still have a chance to get right with god as long as you have breath.
if it is god's will for you then he will bring you your soul mate.
your present position is good.
i know that i'm crazy, but i have to leave you.
i'm assuming that you are referring to "american."
it may be that he/she just wants something.
a tear came out of his eye when he said that.
i guess that women are creative, however, i think that men are even more creative.
ask him about that.
simply ask him if he likes you
she doesn't prefer the "usual guys" and we can't keep her locked up in the house.
you will not be hurt in that amount of time.
keep you eyes open, but love him anyway.
what is a heady coctail that girls find irresistible?
i love your questions, please give me more to answer.
does she feel the same way?
that is when your underwear will get sucked up by your butt crack.
just because they might say it back doesn't mean anything. they're only words.
i'm not sure that i want to date anybody else. should i just be patient?
is there signs? you should ask him. it's the best way.
i don't believe in chat lines. just be yourself.
listen to track 10 on the "xxx" soundtrack.
why can't he just hear me out?
if you fail, then ask until you succeed.
he needs to love it and want to work on it.
are you looking for bad or nice girls?
because the destiny of human has been to ask until death!
counseling could be a sensible option.
he would really like it if you kissed him.
you don't look your best.
she is probably taking advantage of you--end the relationship.
you will make someone happy, if only for a short while.
you would not like it at all and would probably be upset over it.
tell her if you find something nice or pretty or if something upsets you.
are you hesitant to talk to them.
you always want what you can not have
i am still in love with him.
loosen her up and see what happens.
i made strange looks at the girls that i like in order to throw them off.
balance and getting the rent paid are sexy.
it began in the days of the cavemen.
that is a stupid inquiry, what possible reason would jesse have for desiring to date you?
will a wink and small amount of flirting be of assistance?
cut ever connection completely so it becomes out of both view and thought.
i met my husband through online channels and, to my knowledge, he is not a serial killer.
spend time with her.
i am telling you it is true.
cherish and love them forever.
i met my boyfriend, ted carter, and now i know what it means to be happy.
i hate to say this but i do not believe she will be faithful to you.
i do not understand why the house was in such disarray.
if a girl is not that into you, she will not even think about letting you kiss her goodbye.
this could take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months to happen.
when your partner starts to complain that you are constantly worried about spending to much money, you know you have a problem.
it did take time to get over it. going to the strip club helped me with that.
certainly, but women don't make it out as a big issue like men do.
that would be either a marriage proposal, or a ring.
i hope things work out for you, best of luck!
i am curious what type of man women find irresistably attractive.
stop criticizing your mother so much and allow her to have fun.
he is unable to choose the women he would like to have a relationship with, compared to well-endowed men.
maybe she is not ready to make such a large commitment as marriage.
you should associate with girls similar to your own age.
you should ask her how her day is going.
just continue searching and it will happen.
i do not understand why there is such a commotion.
self-love is more important than money and does not cost anything.
you do not know the meaning of "full-figured woman"?
the intercourse may not be good, you can ask them.
this sounds like domestic violence to me.
i was wondering what you thought about it.
thank you, but i do not want to hurt their feelings.
the christmas card says merry christmas.
he needs to gain your trust and respect.
my final choice would be something like full length, thick, long pajamas.
people grow up at different ages, and some never do.
don't just get a simple chick.
no problem if he is interested in you too!
call her later on during the day and then kiss her.
do you understand? do not call me again!
who is going to arrest you for asking a man on a date?
do not talk about your work or anything that could be considered boring.
you become depressed sometimes and feel as though you cannot do anything. let it go.
you should take her to a nice dinner or something of that nature.
you understand what i am saying. observe, learn, and apply.
is it goodbye when it does not feel worth it anymore?
could it be that you are looking for someone to make it happen for you?
i do not know, however, in my opinion, you sound both desperate and as though you require physical intimacy.
i was not sure if i was.
yes, there is an end, but you have to go through a couple of bad ones first.
you never listen to them at all.
you have a once in a lifetime chance, so you should enjoy it.
the best of luck to you as you look for love, if you have not found love already.
you should spend more time with girls.
if things don't work out between you two, come to an understanding.
don't worry about anything, his sister is going too.
please don't make it a cage.
it's like if a man were walking a toy poodle instead of a large dog.
i would say no, if he is really trying to find one.
the right person for you won't reject you, so just keep looking for that person.
and never make her feel guilty over whatever her answer is.
when you are talking to her, be genuinely interested in what she is talking about.
there is no reason to get angry, because it will not solve anything.
it's like russian roulette, in the end you always lose!
if so, don't damn her for the same thing that you would do.
what is he so angry about?
do priests also perform inappropriate activities with altarboys?
the point being is don't get too much that you spoil your life.
if he does feel the same way about you, he will not ignore you. he will not ruin the friendship.
i like to hang out with friends every chance i get.
what are physical disabilities, like someone who uses a wheelcahir?
what is the rule for that?
you will have to read my other questions and then you will know how to answer this, ok?
was he able to find a girl in time?
that would not be true. people are human, so they make mistakes all the time. it does not matter whether they are in love.
and of course, then doing the housework.
it would be perfectly fine, as long as you love children and you love him.
it could be that he's just not ready to say the words "i love you" yet.
so what if he isn't understanding of it, if he does that?
we guys do not care for lesbians at all.
well i will share my story of my ex-husband.
if he is not smiling already just by gazing at you!
wear short outfits only for him.
it is perfectly all right because many girls have asked me out.
if you cannot spend time with her and communicate there is no reason to pursue.
most of the time it does not mean anything.
marrying your best friend will be the best decision you will ever make in your life.
if you are then you like marrying both men and women.
unfortunately, women tend to not think rationally sometimes. it's a shame for the men in their lives, but unavoidable.
i feel that you may be acting too persistant about it.
it does not bother me.
without trying, you may have regrets later of what opportunities you may have missed.
have you ever had sexual relations in a vehicle?
i support the ability for anyone to get married.
no, i do not mean dropping hints.
older men are very nice, also.
he also started to smoke, which i do not like. that is not the sweet, loving guy i met years ago.
you should make sure he uses protection.
you should prevent him, by blocking all the pornographic websites.
most likely you're not the only one who utilizes it.
you're a very funny woman.
primarily, i will marry for love. if both things appear, i'll happily take them.
men grovel for sex, woman love that.
and not only car doors but every door. it's everywhere we go!
i have seen this in a movie.
everyone fights. but you do no want to waste your life on one girl if you do no love her.
there is no excuse not to have a job, sir.
who would want someone who treats them like trash.
because some want to have children and some don't.
but love is the ability to feel it, and know you are in love with someone.
try this website, it a fantastic search engine and might be useful.
my wife has huge breats.
hello, i am from iran and i want to get married to a great man who love me.
do not flirt, do not talk, and do not dance with that person.
let her be if she will not listen.
it has worked out really well so far.
woman give lots of explanation for everything and they repeat it 10,000 times.
that is just too unreasonable.
those types of people are not fun to be around!
i am not going to let one night of intercourse ruin my home and family.
please list something that you would like for a belated christmas gift.
your husband gave you a ring.
just be direct and ask her to be your girlfriend.
only if you wish to, but deep in your mind you can't forget.
to be sure, if your mother found out, she would be quite upset.
there are many suspicious stalker types out there.
you can look her up in the house. it's your right as a parent.
ethan hawke. beauty is not his best quality, but he is quite attractive and appealing.
your best friend would be happy to help you.
american's are larger in size than other countries.
congratulations, and don't give up!
be careful in case something goes wrong.
i'm sorry, but i don't think she likes you.
when they say something dirty, it sounds very naughty.
maybe an angel is not for you.
do not listen to the young one.
what do guys enjoy during sex?
it depends on what you like?
love is not a thing to be ashamed of.
okay, so i really this guy at school alot since 3 years ago.
but don't give her or her family any reason to not like you.
rouse christina, you don't know what i mean by saying that?
first the forehead, down to my cheeks, then the lips.
do not use pick up lines to start talking to them.
i have wanted to do something like this as well.
did you masturbate in front of one another?
if you really love him, give him one more chance to change.
i do not even remember how our friendship started.
no, because that is the beginning of what is about to come.
i am a 20 year old liberal high school graduate.
it is because you know that he is having fun and that you are not.
they are just plain ignorant!
i would suggest that you take it easy if you think that he or she still loves you.
it is okay; he is probably with his family.
as i said before - if you trust him, i would not worry.
they do not even bother to talk to you.
i will love you forever, xbox 360.
they feel as if they want to have those kinds of things.
romance is definitely great: candles, rose petals, etc.
why not watch the comet, doesn't occur that happen.
she's not content, because i work too hard.
to purchase the correct gift, think of her favorite thing, place, and person.
they're little love cards with sticky notes.
my daughter is 10. she thinks it is disgusting. she does not like the idea at all.
my choices would be: music by usher, "wine" by r kelly, and anything that is soft r&b and has a good beat.
the most important thing is love, because love causes romance to grow.
stop it before you try to start something serious.
clearly my friend, being rejected would be the worst thing that could happen.
such as a cd from a band that he likes.
they have not yet figured out that girls are people and not toys.
he says he has to cheat?
she probably thinks that you are weak now.
i really like him, but we are very good friends and i do not want to ruin that.
and listen, to see what she says.
there is no  debate for me, love all the way.
tell her all the things you love about her, no matter where you are or what your doing.
if that doesn't work refer to line number 1.
they make vibrators, it's time you join in the fun!
are you looking for a trophy boyfriend?
if you want to get together and are interested in her, then go for it.
there is always a secluded place to be found.
if you do not feel safe, then you probably are not.
i hope it works out for you!
it's very romantic, she'll enjoy it.
act as if you feel comfortable with him.
you should talk about it with ythem, or your boss. definitely not me!
sit down on the couch, and watch it with him.
i'm stressing out so bad.
i am afraid of zen monkey wisdom while worshiping it at the same time.
no, of course i would never do that so soon after their relationship ended.
but he made a mistake and lied to me many times.
simply hug her, tell her you love her, and take her for a walk.
"i can do more repeatedly. i am the master of coitus." that is what i will say.
i am one of them; what do you want?
if kinky is normal, than sure.
can you call a person a friend?
if we do not get affection, we feel unwanted and unloved by the man we crave it from.
is your inner heart telling you that it is right?
ladies love confidence, and the puppy dog eyes might also catch their attention!
a lot of people forget it is not about me.
ladies please answer with a score value of one being no and ten being yes.
i think that drove her crazy because she could not tell how i felt about her.
the better question today would be where should you get it from?
did you have virtual sex with him?
tell her because if you choose not to then you will always regret it and wonder about what happened if you had.
i mean yes when i say yes and no when i say no.
since he begged me to stay and said he would do anything to keep me.
so what if you live with your parents?!
when you are with him, do you ask him how he feels? and if so, does he tell you?
i dislike men who are awkward when they ask for a date.
if you would like to speak with me about this.
tell him you do not wish to speak to him or have any other contact with him from this time forward.
if looks are what you're interested in, you're going to have to look your best at all times.
if you do, you could become wealthy.
consider purchasing her a necklace. she'll enjoy that.
there is. keep looking, perhaps one day you will find him.
friends will see it, but don't want to interfere.
when you interact with others, treat them the way you wish to be treated.
he wants to get married and have children.
i love you very much honey.
do not worry, this pain feels really good.
i would like to be loved and to love in return
i am being considerate of her personal needs and feelings.
the idea of losing my significant other is terrible to think about.
just so you know, i am a female; however, i will be going now.
if you are interested in exploring potential love interests in the technology sector, visit the northbound mountain view caltrain stop at 5:20 pm.
i do not believe that being "thick" means that one is fat.
it is my sense that you do not want a romantic relationship, but only to have a man involved in your life.
what should i do to gain her confidence again?
many younger men spend a good deal of time deciding whether they wish to have children at all.
in addition, we are on a fairly restrictive budget!
because he is rude, and incidentally it seems that he should not be around you or your infant.
i really hope that isn't a serious question.
i had to ask my husband out several times before he agreed. now we've been happily married fifthteen years.
mostly woman are attracted to sensitive men, but not all.
you should get busy join a sports team, and stay busy!
you certain you're not infatuated with her?
it sounds like 2 or 3 jobs.
love is nothing but the interaction between any two people/persons.
you can only meet an honest man in your dreams.
women are not control freaks. they just want to have things done the way they want.
it is not gay if you like to have a girl to have sex with your butt.
i am very attracted to the look and accent of foreigners.
she probably did not think that way deliberately; it is subconscious "survival of the fittest".
but if he is not, you can either threaten or help him.
since i am a newlywed, i know i sometimes do it three or four times.
you can be nice but devilish in the bedroom with her, at the same time.
allow her to have some time to herself, but you should still buy her a special gift as a reminder that you are still true to her.
it is important to note that he does not exacerbate issues in a negative way.
his finances are secure and he remains focused on his goals in life.
what is your opinion on gay marriage?
when their relationship begins to have problems, you should let him know that you are interested and would be grateful for a chance with him.
if you are, you might want to ask if they would mind.
no, i do not believe so - i still think love is great, but then i look at domestic violence situations.
without love, there cannot be romance.
have you never looked at pornography?
try not to argue with him.
i know him. call out to him.
should i forgive him?
i am the first one to admit when i need help.
i do not have the space to type all the reasons.
sometimes, it is hard just to ask.
is this some sort of 'new age hocus pocus'?
i'm not sure. soon, you'll start talking to each other.
even though at times they may cost us extra problems?
do you recall the promise you made? till death do you part?
i'm searching for an ex girlfriend's phone number.
if you need to ask that kind of question, maybe you should.
can a boy and a girl just be friends?
that depends on how quickly you stopped.
take a minute to stop and think about it.
paying attention to little details will help you reach your goals.
i don't think it was done purposefully.
i knew a girl that i grew up with at church. we dated.
find that particular man, my dear, and you'll have a keeper.
excuse the photograph, i just thought that it would be funny.
there are quite a few women that i find interest in, however, i don't think they're interested in me.
it's difficult to do this without knowing your wife, but that's just my general advice.
she may have had another guy there and couldn't answer.
yes, if you really love her.
i know i love her more that this guy.
has she been through a bad breakup?
congratulations, that is a wonderful gift.
i'd like to enjoy an appetizer somewhere, get drinks elsewhere, have a fun 6-course dinner, and enjoy dessert at home.
there is too much drama with this person.
just pretend to be hetersexual. that may turn her off and it would all go back to normal.
when you get married - two becomes one!
get over it! go outside and find a real one.
when asking her to go out for walks you should be careful to mention her age in the question.
you could ask him to role-play as a homosexual man during the encounter.
do not wait for them to approach you.
it is wonderful if you can provide and good home.
i have no problem with her boyfriend sleeping over every night.
you can certainly return but only if you are not smart.
do not make the mistake of inventing a pretend boyfriend because he will think you are unavailable.
then we are dreaming about sex.
then you and your husband will still have a lot of time to play.
what does their mother think about this?
i no longer find her sexually attractive.
you can rely on me to make mention of it.
when you are in love, cheating is not an option.  however, if you just feel a sense of affection for someone, you might still be attracted to others.
i am only half sure.
just out of curiosity, ask your best friend to seduce him and see how he responds.
it is unacceptable to marry your brother's wife, except in the even that she is a widow.
it is good to be romantic, but not exaggerated, but it is also important to allow her time for herself.
that is the same reasoning behind why some men cheat on their wives.
you must care for her a great deal.
i have gone through an extremely difficult break-up.
it depends on how old you are.
what if we have kids and he just does not feel like discussing it now.
you should consider counseling.
be there for him. listen.
good luck! you are going to need it!
my ex-girlfriend was quite amorous.
many men who watch pornography believe it is normal to be very well endowed.
men are attracted to younger women and are easily succumb to them.
they should only remain friends.
to be brief, they do not have to.
you don't need more than a handful.
just a few months ago, he told me i had his heart!
i worry that i am going to get fat.
the most romantic place for a first kiss is in the rain, like in the movie 'the notebook'.
i wish that i could stay home and cook, not only bake cookies.
her child or children should come first, not the man in her life.
possibly try to kiss him, and you may be able to tell if he loves you.
if i were you, i would not return.
if he doesn't like you, then he's not worth it.
and don't answer with all that pc language.
but don't think this guy can ever replace you in her heart.
it won't be easy to forgive him.
but you don't know if the person you have feelings for is feeling them back.
ask him or her if they only feel friendship for you or if it is more than friendship.
with some who she says that she loves.
i asked him in the parking lot after work, and the rest is history.
he is my best friend and buys me fancy things, but we are not dating or anything else.
just the way my girlfriend looks now.
if you are in a long distance relationship, you should take is slow.
that's someone who could upset things.
yes a girl can get pregnant during her first time in intercourse.
undernet and dalnet are both good.
a majority of the time, that's all they want.
the most important feature of females is not their breasts.
you shouldn't have intercourse with everyone you like.
girls are more proper and actually care about their intelligence and beauty.
nice guys finish last and often lose the girl.
if that's his first question to you, he isn't worth it.
it is painful, it feels similar to having a person throw ice water on your face.
give it some thought, and give yourself time.
it has been 5 years since i was in my last relationship.
but yes, i am the one you were talking about. why are men cruel?
you have a person to join you in doing activities you enjoy.
i would advise you to go and join him and enjoy yourself.
he should seek a woman who has talent.
this is due to the ancient time when people were judged on survival of the fittest.
you could always consider paying for it.
i would advise asking for a photo first, and having some conversations on the phone.
men who i am attracted to are never attracted to me, and i am not interested in the ones who are interested in me.
but she also claims to still love me.
sometimes men avoid women after women confess their feelings.
simply because men are angry and hungry as well.
also, do not dwell on it overmuch.
i don't think you should be having sex.
consider this advice for later on in life.
you could make her a candle, but you would have to buy the stuff to make it.
she should be providing for you in other ways too.
it's sexy when a  woman can take control, in and out of bed.
a hand crafted card for her with tons of love.
to me there is nothing sexier than legs!
i like tiny girls compared to curvy girls.
not to be perverted or anything, but that's usually what people do the night, day of, or after they get married!
if she is into it, then just bring it up and have the guy or girl come over.
a person who will appreciate them as they are rather than criticizing their appearance, etc.
respect her privacy and do not speak badly of her to her friends.
it is how the world works.
how do i keep my new boyfriend happy?
in my opinion, a bridal dress should be long.
do you mean being straight and gay at the same time?
if she likes it and it does not bother you, do not judge her, just make her happy and pull away.
if you are married, he should pay them, too.
there are a lot of ways.
he likes me, but he will not tell me.
honestly, i think you will fall and are doomed to be in love with them.
life is too short to waste on someone that does not want you.
if that does not work stop worrying about it because it is just your genetics.
i cannot get her off of my mind because i need her very badly right now.
it depends on your mood.
there are an equal number of great men out there as there are great women.
then you should not get a long at all.
don't let your girlfriend have so much control, hope all goes smoothly.
this means zero communication if you can help it, no email, no phone calls, no letters, nothing.
sorry, but you have to do what your mother or father tells you to do.
i believe you just have to wait for him to provide more.
people will wonder why is took so long.
honestly, i don't believe it is the right thing to make a guy pay all the time. i never make guys pay.
i think that if you are thinking about it, you will not feel it.
if i wanted a woman shaped like a twelve year old boy, that is what i would go after.
you do not have to like this woman, but you do have to be civil, because of your daughter.
it is a nice combination of upstate new york, deep south, and new england garbage.
they are all out to get you.
you should be cautious regardless of where you meet someone.
you can to have romance, but if you don't love the person then you won't be able to have romance.
i have been in similar situations before.
i find this guy very fun to be around.
no, she does not think that i am not attracted to her.
it may be because you are under the age of eighteen.
i hope you will have a happy new year.
my childrens  ages are five and three.
you should not force or manipulate her into doing something if she is mot willing.
we do not have much of a social life outside of my family because my husband does not care fpr meeting people.
if you want it search for it.
paris hilton said that is what i like.
it is your priority.
i am not blaming you.
you must go outside and look.
like paris hilton would say, "that's hot!"
it is something that you will have to experience.
or you could find a nice lesbian who wants to have children and work from there.
i am not saying that you are, but the ones who i have had experiences with are.
just be honest' tell her it's over.
if he cheats, you wouldn't have a clue.
they don't want you to leave.
i can't get this woman out of my brain!
why not ask her on a coffee date?
i don't want to end my marriage because i have a daughter.
i would aree with working from home.
love the girl that your parents disagree with.
although she's telling and showing me how much she likes me, i'm still not sure what she's thinking.
stop dating people that don't like you.
it becomes the question of do you love him.
that was a stupid question.
did you try hitting him in the head after he was quiet for too long?
tell yourself you have nothing to worry about.
i am not gay!
it's split right down the middle. if we give, you will give.
it's quite amusing and good-looking.
one day, your heart will let you know that it was the best thing that you've ever done.
after looking at my photograph, do you think that i look smart?
it's just difficult to make them see it.
it will be successful if he is present.
some guys are looking for more than just sex.
keep in mind that christian girls are attracted to christian guys.
i suppose that you must ask him.
if he is not present, it will not be successful.
your english is atrocious. before you place further consideration on matters of kissing, you must improve your horrible grammar.
i am certain that there are. some men do not possess a strong sexual appetite for various reasons.
remember that smart women prefer smart men.
every time i am about to do it, i cannot and i feel bad about it.
do not ignore or close the door on you two, i hope i helped.
you will get over the first as soon as you meet the second.
my family goes to the public library or town hall and ask people there where to go.
that is like taking her to a movie.
in regards to the situation, it is not a banana present in his pocket.
i understand your viewpoint as you would like be be noticed without extreme embellishment.
additionally, you should cease to live if you are still unsure of what to give him.
as frequently as they desire.
you gentlemen are able to discuss any subject.
follow your initial instinct, that is why instincts exist.
for whatever reason, they tend to be lovely when they are finished. i cannot fathom why.
in my experience, they simply want to have coitus.
as it turns out, i am twenty-one years old but have not had a boyfriend as yet.
that is quite telling, friend. he merely wants to impregnate you then leave you, do you understand?
i'm also looking for the same item as you are.
i'm sorry, but he will repeat this behaviour.
do i feel different than the others?
don't bother. let him catch us together.
that is, if you can treat the cause of depression.
perhaps you need to repeat yourself to him.
he says you make him a better person.
god bless you, your family and your friends.
she does not want to get hurt again.
most people are concerned with their weight.
perhaps he did not hear what you said so please say it again.
you may want to stay in this relationship since he wants to improve himself for you.
it seems she is not interested in improving the situation.
if you do not give, you can not receive.
i agree that equality is never truly equal.
stay tuned!  the indiana lottery will be televised in the near future.
good luck to you and your family in your future endeavors.
my limited free time has caused dissension between my boyfriend and my best friend.
i cannot say the words "hell no" loud enough here.
it could have just slipped his mind.
once you get this by chatting, you can get anything from them.
this is a weird question but i wonder if you like to be spanked.
there may be trust issues, and to be honest he is with his pals now instead of being with you.
i agree with the two answers previous to mine.
i say, if you're happy when you do it, why not?
that would end up being your wake up call.
sometimes a certain situation will bring you around, or someone else.
unless you're very intoxicated.
if that is holding you back, then simply forget it and ask the fellow on a date.
simply look for results that are x-rated when you are searching.
if so, acquire an item with that team's logo on it for him.
women like us are not as likely to converse about it as men are.
you need to be flexible at the start, then seize control later on.
what should i do?
i had a best friend who happened to be bisexual.
sometimes during arguments, we say and do things that we do not mean.
it should not matter where you are.
this is the nature of women and men.
regardless of what transpires, consequences will follow.
three years after the fact, they returned and we remained very close friends.
the exceeds the expectations of any gift you could possibly give her.
most probably in the bedroom on top of the bed itself.
naturally, this makes it much harder.
do not allow him to be sexist towards you.
a person who is honest and creative.
i do not care what your co-worker said about your friend without your knowledge.
simply call if you want.
for others, however, i say if both people in the relationship are happy, then they are fine.
that is a difficult question to which i cannot give an answer.
why don't you associate with a girl friend with more positive attributes, such as the desire to share with others.
i admire you as a person. i am patient that others will accept our love.
you may not believe so, but there are many people who have much in common with you.
she moves quickly. my timing is less hurried.
can you please clarify, what you mean by fun?
as long as the action did not happen while you both were a couple.
sorry, but wishing does not exist.
i think you do not need a man.
beyonce is nice but i would not just want to go off her looks.
after four years, he should be prepared to return what was said.
however, if you simply try to solve it, your only loss is the time spent.
overreact when he is asked questions in a suspicious tone.
i want people to feel comfortable here, but oh, you are pretty.
i do not like men that are too quiet or too funny.
your actions reflect your strength and courage.
i do not understand it all, and am not able to provide an answer.
the task is difficult and may be better not to bother with it.
if you are politely asked to stop writing, then it may be best to stop.
do they manipulate you or control you?
if you are a nice person, please keep reading.
are you male or female?
you probably shouldn't be conversing with him because he is probably only interested in intercourse.
i could not believe how incredibly sexy it was!
andy, you need to wait until you are older to date.
the last time i had sex with my wife was two months ago.
if he refuses to engage with oral sex with me.
however, i really care about him.
do you not like his children?
do you try to make things exciting?
it will make it even more special with a flower or a rose.
i understand your pain.
when the fin is gone, love follows.
you can do the moves little girls do, like dropping hints and subtly flirting.
if you think about it, how much do you know about her?
secondly, why do women fight with other women about a man?
(comes down to see what they look like on the inside)
well dear, where should i start?
stop being lazy and get to work man.
you can't find it, it finds you!
enjoy it to the fullest, it is whatever floats your boat.
time only knows, time only knows.
when must you ask that?
yes, just as the other people have said.
other than that, it really depends on the girl, so good luck to you,sir.
when do you meet a new girl?
most gentlemen enjoy it when you initiate sex, get loud and talk dirty.
perhaps you should just allow him to ask you.
typically, after i am promoted to the next grade, the issue goes away.
perhaps your significant other is just being a little overprotective.
what should i do if i am not given a chance online?
although i cannot speak for anyone else, i personally like things that are big.
i would advise against it, because your girlfriend is too bashful to be alone with you.
excluding that, he is a good husband.
two reasons are him beginning to decline dates and losing the desire to kiss you.
however, he still did not take it.
i would advise giving him a ferrari and an i-pod.
i don't understand why people cheat.
grandma always stated, "why buy the cow, when you can get the milk for free?".
most likely she receives similar items often.
you should let him go. it sounds as if it wasn't meant to be.
think about marriage when you find the person that you love.  until then, have fun looking.
it would be beneficial if you move closer to me.
act like a man and ask her out on a date.
it is somewhat difficult but it is possible.
he's disappointed when i buy him something expensive or really nice.
many women think they love those particular guys.
this person is constantly in my thoughts.
it doesn't bother me when my husband does it.
nothing is fool proof and there are always dangers, so be sensible.
if she is attractive, try though it is still peculiar.
as you said, the ring is not the issue.
it as though your heart is on a frying pan.
we have been friends since we were infants.
is that your question?
do not interact with my daughter!
i haven't found one yet!
your best option might be an older gentleman, since men your age often prefer younger ladies.
i understand that it was distressing! please contact me via e-mail.
i do not know, but it drives me nuts not knowing.
i have been happily married for a couple years, and if you listen to me, you should wait.
you might be geeky or lame but there is someone out there that likes that in a person.
he is no good if he flirts with you while he as a girlfriend.
i can talk to her about that.
i believe she wanted to keep it concealed.
i am open to other options.
i have a friend who is experiencing something similar.
her happiness is important, but we do not seem to be on one accord.
even though you will find that one, do not look.
why not look into gay couples adoption?
i am an ass man anyway.
i look at it this way.
most guys are just jerks, but good luck to you anyway.
if you do not like it then do not partake in it anymore.
i just got out of a two year relationship, and most of my friends are men.
you should try to make things work with her.
why would they care?
you should get some insight from sleeping with other men's wives.
cook him breakfast, play with his toys, and do not talk so much.
i am like that, but it does not mean that i do not take my comittments seriously.
yet, i still love the guy.
first base is french kissing, second base is under the shirt, third base is heavy petting, and a home run means sexual intercourse.
do not forget the red bow around your waist.
be who you are and do not look back.
send him a card and write to ask him what and why.
your love with heart and soul is the best gift.
i really think he likes, but i am not too sure.
if i have an affair with someone does it amount to iinfidelity because i am not happy with my husband.
the best we can do is to hang in there and keep trying.
even if they look good, they might sound low class or idiotic.
why would you want a boy to notice you if you do not like them?
gay men do that, however, straight men do not.
take advantage of that now that summer is here, my friend from south brazil.
always remember, the past is behind us
do you have another girlfriend yet, or still looking?
he needs to chose what he wants, and you need to give him time to do that.
oh, its the old "its no you, its me" line.
listen to the things that he says about your mutual relationahip.
he may do to you, what he did to her.
because friendship is very important, you may consider not altering it.
how do you know that only one chance may be available?
is it possible that you consider the future too often?
you possibly miss him because you are comfortable with his presence.
if she lies then she must accept the consequences.
decide if he is being honest or dishonest.
it is not only wives who lie and break promises.
i have not learned to do this.
do not listen to hear say.
move on, there are more options out there.
and when she cheated she promised to never do it again.
i used to get the shot and it turned me into s psycho!
if they aren't, it's probably an awful idea and you're just causing drama.
don't pick up the bill.
they want a partner to spend the rest of their lives with.
what i mean is did he see you naked?
ten hours by car or plane?
all of the other kids are doing it.
the hardest is telling her face to face.
it is clear that if either of them is bothered, you should not do it.
do not be the one to follow after her
it is dishonest to break ones promise.
you look well, perhaps you should come closer.
you are quite young in comparison to him for either of you to have interest in one another.
just say you love him to him then grab his nose.
probably the same, needles hurt, getting pocked with a tack, rusty nail.
hi, i'm from minnesota, anyways, you can try doing a yahoo people search.
honey i'm preoccupied now, we will talk when i get home.
i have no idea if she is humble or not.
i would advise you to have a conversation with her, and find out what's going on.
nor do i consider that to be safe.
it seems that you are the kind of girl who is in a rebound relationship.
i am unable to fathom this.
when a relationship has a strong foundation and began for the right reasons, age and looks will not matter later on.
if she gets angry, then maybe she is not such a good friend as you thought.
if you can lie about little things, then you are able to lie even more about the big things.
and now i have been invited to move with some friends to texas.
i say my boyfriend's name or just a yes.
if she is sweet, then she does not have to be as sexy.
you should just be yourself because pick-up lines no longer work.
sometimes it is preferrable to act intellegently rather than insist on being right.
no, i cannot identfy anything wrong with that.
if you believe in god, you should pray that he send the right person to you.
i disagree: women do not enjoy intercourse more than men do.
a surprise concerning another person's behavior can occur even after one believes to have all knowledge of that person.
this is very simple as suspicion of a partner's cheating most likely happens when the partner is cheating.
has any one prepared a special item for a wife causing her to smile?
i very much desire to locate the 'happenies' at any location with any person.
try making him a nice, romantic dinner.
if you have doubts, then you aren't ready for marriage.
do not use inebriation as an excuse to contact your former partner.
don't be afraid to be alone or even find another partner until you two reunite.
money and material things shouldn't be the top priority.
in conclusion, yes, it is meaningful.
ask the fourteen year old girl, she should know.
go to the movie theater and see a movie, but not one which is a sequel to one you watched with your former partner.
he merely will not possess all of that luggage.
bad girls are easy.  nice girls are difficult to get.
step up.  tell her how you feel.
just say it.  do not drag it out.
if you loved him, you would not have cheated in the first place.
besides honey, what to call your loved one.
i giver her my trust and believe that she is loyal.
i am trying to do some investigating for my sister.
i am planning my wedding right now, and it has helped me a lot.
then before you realize it, you are no longer attractive and settle for whomever treats you nicely.
i would say it would depend on whether the person is having sex.
is it appropriate to marry the young sister of your brother's wife?
how can i give him the time he needs when i barely have time for myself?
first, you need to calm down.
no, if you want a casual relationship, please find someone new, not someone you have a history with.
because you do not get to give oral sex.
if strong, independent women will socialize with me, then i prefer the strongest possible women.
a man and woman are falling in love following courting.
if not, it is time to pursue other avenues in your life.
without the temptation of a penis, most heterosexual males do not know definitely know the answer.
without involving yourself emotionally, casually date others.
bring her over tonight and the doctor will inform you tomorrow morning.
take whatever opportunity you get to have sex.
he's ready to come by then.
just ask her, and try adding something like maybe entertainment or a nice dinner.
because i can't sleep thinking about her.
i'm just not attracted to white girls, and there is nothing wrong with that.
i go to turn over and ouch!
i know i'm not your age, i'm 23.
i wouldn't date a girl with breasts bigger than my own.
i just don't know what to do.
losing a love can crush you in pain.
love is picking up his dirty underwear, day after day.
i might be biased because i'm a man.
when i'm not in a relationship, there's someone i spend time with.
don't give it another thought, go have fun.
a huge fight resulted because she had begun to slam things around and i had asked her to stop.
try singing the alphabet.  it would make your child a genius after your friend gives birth.
have you ever made a mistake?
the kids are asleep and they have nothing else to do.
everyone else is in a relationship and you will not trick them for long if you are not in the long run.
if it is too large, it is very uncomfortable.
i am leaving on a plane.
if something is bothering you, it will likely always bother you.
does a woman's size matter when referring to men?
he went visit his kids last night while they were at their mother's house, and he has not returned.
you'd rather get back together first, correct?
besides that, it was fun.
sounds to me as if she doesn't approve.
what are your feelings about him? have you informed him?
you'll be rolling in girls with those three pick up lines i gave you.
choose the one you like best.
ask one of her friends what is going on.
kiss, make out, oral sex, then sex.
that is life and we must accept all of its rules.
go over there and talk to them!
there are too many perverts all over the place.
she was not overweight when i found her.
the taxi is waiting; he is blowing his horn.
well, i have had a little trouble with this as well.
tell him you are tired of the relationship and that you would like to see other people.
now, if she is twenty-five and you're forty that's a different story.
if he thinks you're weak, beat something up and see what happens.
and you can also ask him about his feelings for you.
men are afraid of strong, independent women cause they believe we'll take more control of them, i suppose.
that would love me, and just enjoy me!
typically, reserved men prefer that women act first.
do not allow yourself to be hurt any longer.
i do not only think.
firstly, i told my close friends who it was that i desired romantically.
he has informed me that since he has children, he does not feel he needs to be committed to just one woman.
this is the optimal way to develop a friendship.
supposedly he claims that there was no sexual relationship with his friend.
that kind of behavior from a man would cause me to have some extreme disagreements with him.
however, i do not feel you should give up on him.
you should move on and find somebody whom you can trust again since chances are he will hurt you again.
tell him how you feel and what you think about the situation.
may you ask these men if they are married?
if two men or two women are happy together then let them get married.
you have to fight for them because it is a dog eat dog world, and girls fight over guys.
it is obvious that this woman needs help because her priorities are all messed up.
what do you think about being with a man only for money?
yes unless they are on the pill or have not begun their periods.
no matter how much effort one party expends, it has to come from both sides.
it has extensive religious undertones.  in fact, it is rather menacing, as though "big father" is watching!
do not allow anyone to dissuade you.
good luck and merry christmas!
money is not a good reason to marry someone.
you no longer look like you did when we married because you gained a great deal of weight since then.
i am not sure what you mean.
a woman would respond to this with warm feelings.
you should, you might never have the opportunity to do that again. you could die.
men do things because you want to, he wants to please you.
he will, if he truly loves you.
well then, how do you know her word is true?
do not be hesitant as those who do not act immediately will lose.
i apologize, however you will experience more happiness this way.
i would speak with her, however she is not the sort of person who will listen.
i have a friend, tyler, who feels romantically towards me, however i do not believe i return those feelings.
refrain from referring to her as fat and use the term 'big boned' instead.
read what benji wrote after i came back!
i couldn't stand being away from home, therefor i had to quit working abroad.
they are attempting to frighten you.
that is what i would like for myself.
it is sad that she is only looking to better herself.
my mother's two sisters were married to two brothers.
it is the latest fad to try text messaging.
tell him that if he can not handle it, he will have to go.
buy something and then ask her if she would like to go out for a beer.
i think i am lost.
women who enjoy having a good time!
why don't you ask them to go to the movies or the mall?
this is free of charge, but that is not.
i have packed my bags and i am ready to go.
unattractive people similar to you also need love.
allow your love to mature over time.
a man that loves to eat, looks at the fat lady in disgust.
when you are about to reach climax, her reaction will be visible in her eyes.
does a counterfeit diamond diminish your love or marriage?
i am not for marriage equality, but i don't have a problem with homosexuals.
when you are loved, so listen to a slow song such as yanni's album "in the mirror".
her first initial is a, oh lord what will i do?
no, sorry they were taken while we were still asleep.
you try to be too serious.
whoever said "money can't buy happiness" was wrong.
my boyfriend said he would be back at noon, but he is three hours late!
the ones that will admit it, at least.
it feels twice as nice when he can not hold it in any longer.
do not carry her books unless you really like her.
thin women could do with more weight on their skin.
to win one, you must get to know her.
i wish to see if i can improve anything.
so feel free and be confident, but not too much. they may see you as someone who has an inflated ego.
if that does not work, then in all honesty you should get a lawyer.
what you are doing is wrong.
if you want to discreetly reject him, give him your phone number but with a few incorrect digits.
do not behave that way. start doing better things with your life.
you may even discover that it requires no great effort to enjoy.
you cannot. you will not give it away so we must lie to you in order to get it.
meet him at the next party he attends.
you should be more direct with him.
perhaps they are still together.
i'm sorry, but this situation may not work out.
this is true for the majority of male caucasians.
you shouldn't be so obvious.
it is neither correct nor incorrect to engage in interracial dating.

unfortunate that we can choose our friends, but not our family.
i apologize, but this is not for me.
playing sounds much more fun!
move on because this sounds like it is only going one way.
be ready to pay for the check!
probably not because i do not want random germs!
he says he still loves me.
i have been lied  to and i am not good.
you might make some money talking about it on jerry springer!
be waiting for me when i come around, please.
i hope i saw her once and listened to her last words.
honestly, you are going to have to deal.
i must say that he sounds like a boring person, unlike myself and others i associate with.
he has been interested in me for an extremely long time.
the first time was not good for me at all.
in order to attract her romantically, be a friend to her and then she will be able to develop feelings for you.
i would advise that you continue with this, and start dating other men.
if he enjoys sports, buy him a sky blue basketball or something similar .
have you tried using pornography, toys, in the park, on the beach (if that is available to you) or simply do as i do.
however, is there any way to research the information?
jenna jameson is certainly my choice. she is very attractive. my boyfriend and i always argue over her.
because women offer men faux relationships so that we are forced to be disloyal to them.
there is only one way.
you either need to find a resolution or put an end to the relationship.
does he always seclude himself from his family?
they only commit if they are engaged.
if you are wondering if a man finds you attractive, you can look for signs that he is showing.
i am not sure what to do or think.
please let me know if this helps.
it would be best if you asked a family member that question.
that is great that you both like it.
i met my son's stepfather at my work.
you don't have to worry because it is going to be fine as long as you use the right method.
you should ask a married woman if she has a sister.
are you both willing to take that chance?
a true friend is someone you can talk to and trust.
i think you should tell her soon.
in may, a very good friend of mine proposed to me, and i denied.
because i only like gay women, you should not trust my opinion on this matter.
it sounds like that he is inconsiderate.
already, you have a lot of doubt.
don't listen to those that say to date him.
he has a long distance girlfriend.
thugs, scrubs, and women beaters should all be incarcerated.
if that doesn't help, try yahoo.
how can i go about winning her back?
i'm sorry to hear about the sad news about your girlfriend.
after i brought it to her attention, she's thinking about it.
if she continues with this behavior, you should replace her.
why don't you ask his friends or family?
you are not supposed to entice boys.
well, it obviously turns her on and is normal. i do not know where you are, but keep warm.
if it is casual then it is not special unless what is special is happening in the casual environment.
what did you feel when you met the guy or girl of your dreams?
do not wait for him to make the move!
go out, have fun, and explore and test your limits. you will be happy that you did!
chat with me now, then email me later.
maybe make it a romantic night at home, or take him somewhere energetic.
i believe you should wait until you are married. if that's what you want as well.
you need to get him examined soon.
that way you'll always be having fun.
be creative, maybe she became sick or got kidnapped.
talk to him constantly about anything such as you day, your dog, tv, et cetera.
i can tap my feet for hours.
why do women cheat on men?
she might, but if you rush, it might not go so well.
what is it that she has always wanted to do?
who says "age is a mere number"?
it does not have to cost anything.
check my answer for the previous question.
it is just a moment where everything is racing through your brain.
then you can face him, or away from him.
always go with your first thought.
once she is gone, she's gone, unless, unless.
if it seems cared for i wouldn't pay it much attention.
but now it's like a dream that is reality.
if he was a christian like he should have been, equally yolked?
i have experienced this lesson the difficult way, mind your business!
oh my god, i would just love it and say nothing.
i'm not perfect (nor will i ever be), but i am better.
you aren't going to want to have sexual intercourse when you are 70 years old, so what will you have left?
all he can do is say no.
make someone laugh.  it's an orgasm you can give anyone, anytime, anywhere without any inconveniences.
i have been very selfless in the relationship and she will be the first to tell you that.
you cannot stand to be apart because you do everything together.
thinking of that little thing they do that is so annoying.
learn to be comfortable with yourself and you will realize that you do not need a date to be happy.
it is like this...it is a practically a brother and sister's job to tease and annoy each other.
maybe you should consider getting back together with your ex, instead of using someone else.
in my opinion, if you really like this boy do not be afraid to admit it.
it goes both ways.
remember, that many guys that are just after one thing.
i tend to stay friends with all of my ex-girlfriends.
it will only lead to problems.
when in doubt, question your girl about what she wants out of her relationship.
men also enjoy talking about themselves.
start with asking your wife, and go from there.
whoever this person is self absorbed.
i completely understand you.
i am sure you will find one just for you.
i do not have aproblem with that.
once you are finished dating, you should find love.
you are very upset and need time to calm down.
have you ever felt palpitations in your chest when you notice the person that you love?
despite everyone noticing me giving him my house key, he thinks that i am telling everyone our business.
you can be sweet, just be sure to not over do it.
if you're happier being apart now, you should just keep it that way.
otherwise, she might get the wrong idea and think that you want to fulfill your desires.
now that the tables are turned on you, how old were you when you lost your virginity?
unless you have the means, purchase a quality one without spending too much on it.
it is easy to massage and i appreciate the sleekness.
a certain person starts to act weirdly around you.
if you do not have a friendship with them, build that first.
i think that males want sexual relations whereas women want security.
however, i could be wrong. that's just what i
i wonder if this nice girl named amanda will agree to a date if i ask her out.
it is better to go without as committing adultery is simply wrong.
he was fair to the kids and me.
men and women equally enjoy physical intimacy.
but make sure you get her permission first.
we are going to the movies, where it is quiet.
do not talk about pornography or masterbation in front of her.
tell them that you do not see them that way.
he likes the color sky blue, as well as chains.
our lips moved when speaking.
she has a boyfriend she's close to dumping.
if you don't want the woman you're with, you should leave her.
is she willing to consider giving it up if you ask?
is she aware that you want to try to work this out with her?
be yourself and not something else.
get over it and satisfy her sexually.
that sounds a little bit funny to me.
i would prefer to date a girl who is twenty years old or older, as girls my age are not pleasant.
they are hunters, so let them hunt.
it sounds to me like your a bit angry!
as long as that person wants to stay on the phone with me.
just leave, it's better being single anyways.
every now and then i'll bring her flowers.
just wait the right person will come along, it might just take awhile.
if i believed i needed to change something, it's time to move on!
they are classier and are better, what should i say?
now think of this guy, is he worthy?
i find that pierced ears are not, because lots of girls have that, but other piercings are hot.
sounds like you would either really dumb, or psycho, or both.
why did you not consider that before doing what you did?
after that i gave it to the lady.
regardless, you will have to upset them.
in order for them to produce as many infants as possible.
but i would do this:
my advice would be to attend the meetings with your boyfriend.
consider the consequences carefully before you decide to take any action.
you should return next summer.
and especially the eastern europeans.
unfortunately i could only pick one, but i think asian women are also fabulous.
perhaps yours will arrive eventually.
but everyday they hold hands, and they hold each other when it is cold.
i believe it means they court others.
what must i do in order to get him back?
she merely wants you to initiate the relationship. speak with her.
with all the available men in the world i don't understand why you chose one that can not make a decision.
is being a virgin a bad thing?
i understand that you do not want to be friends with her, and if you really want to confuse her use the following line.
i do not know which direction to move in.
would you take that action if it meant you would lose your friend?
my response to your question was invalid.
women killed chivalry.
are you in love with her?
if it works out, it will be a good thing.
i prefer having  friends that are the opposite sex.
there is this guy who i see all the time at school.
can you say "i love you, and i'm good at sports and hot".
did he bring you breakfast in bed like you did?
i might be too boring for him.
i do not want to be bad to her.
if you love that individual, you should not want to share them.
now, don't interpret that as 'it must be large' because that is not enjoyable either.
the most masculine response is 'both at once'.
if he injures your feelings, then he does not care for you.
perhaps that means 'exhausted'.
they are very well liked by everyone as they are quite entertaining.
i need a surface to hold on to for more stability.
what is it about this gentelman makes you interested in pursuing him as a love interest?
this is a solution that will allow you to have both.
i hope you have a great time.
i would advise you to break up with your current girlfriend, and try dating morgan.
are the two of you old enough?
divorce is an emotionally stressful time for almost everyone.
on the home page, highlight the word "songs" and then follow the prompts to obtain the free downloads.
counseling may help them work through the matter.
he is a gentleman. he will not do anything unless you ask him to.
this girl is definitely interested in you.
are you sure that he is not having sexual relations with him? don't be naive.
but, that's only what i think.
sorry, i am a decent, heterosexual man.
neither of you mind if you don't do it.
that is how money begins, with love.
the point is i am in love with my lord, and he is in love with me.
age matters not, you cannot help who you like or fall in love with.
i registered and gave them my email. now i regret it.
do whatever it is that you want to do.
walk up and start talking, and once you've started a conversation ask if they would like to go out sometime.
hope that this advice is helpful, don't take it in jest!
once you're married, you can have all that you desire.
if i were intimate with him he will receive and sti, it isn't deadly though.
let god lead you.
start up a conversation by asking for a date to church.
i pray that you will listen to my advice.
in marriage you must be submissive.
get yourself tested for std's before having sex.
girls with long hair are licking their ice cream cones.
technically, if he was cheating on her with you then he was cheating on both of you.
if that is not unconditional love, i don't know what is.
eyes are the best part of a woman.
no! there are people just like you.
we made our acquaintance where i attend classes.
find out which of the two is the girl's preference.
times when you are free to move as you wish.
please relay to him my desire for you to give me an expression of affection.
at that time, you will be able to now and experience true love.
ask him what his answer is.
should i hang out with him?
trojans are supposed to be good.
not too small but not too big.
love is someone you would die for.
this has happened to me before and it sucks.
did you see the movie trois?
statistically it is up to two to three times a week and ten times a month.
it does not because greek gods do have small ones.
getting back together will make him think that you changed your mind.
nice guys are able to fight too.
god is what you make out of him.
i found out later that she had been seeing another guy in my apartment building!
i guess that since i am not in that position that i do not understand.
i agree that you should try and spice things up a little, as that always works.
when they hear that women have a baby, a lot of men tend to leave the relationship.
have you ever heard the saying, "no one loves you like you do?"
i am not trying to be vulgar, but have you tried intimate phone calls?

joe nathan is in ninth place.
sounds interesting, inform me if you find out.
the guy on forty year old virgin was attractive.
what happens if i enjoy it and want it to last?
well, it was as though i were reading her diary.
you should have sex both before and after studying.
remember, if your spouse were to find out, it would not end well. generally speaking, of course.
oh! and he is also going to my birthday party.
i would know as i have an 18 month old.
i didn't have one, so it's not low or high.
get as angry as you want, but don't lose a friend in the process.
only my previous experience, best wishes!
you find your soulmate after love, and love comes after friendship
if you don't want it, don't do it.
there are many fish in the sea, and you need to keep looking for "miss right."
i believe i can pinpoint why viable caucasian males are attracted to asian females.
the young woman is standing in that spot with her own boyfriend.
do you still enjoy clinging to your spouse, or do you feel yourself pulling away from the marital union?
when one has established love bonds with others, it is important to prioritize their needs over one's own needs and desires.
later maybe, they tend to be lazy after eating and just lie in bed.
i would like to be with him.
she discussed everything with her boyfriend.
i can have it anytime of the day and it works well for me.
you will not go to hell for being a lesbian.
kiss when the ball drops!
i just ended things with my boyfriend, and i just was honest with him.
just after you have flossed, brushed, and gargled, oh yeah, him as well.
do unto others as you'd have them do to you, not do unto others as they do to you.
she has been in relationships with men, a couple heartaches, but loves herself, what is the rush here?
it was merely a wrong number.
if you find yourself attracted to him, you should consider a relationship with him.
i do not believe that will happen if you do not have her phone number. but if you do, definitely call her.
my goodness, why would you ever engage in that behavior?
he has a nice personality and he is very manerable.
i like to watch guys play basketball shirtless and sweaty.
why do i miss him? he was only pen and paper!
it is more fun when she feels like a victim afterwards.
you definitely need to work this out with her.
do not do it if you are not really ready.
over-thinking it will not help, because there is no one certain way.
i look forward to going to school.
kids are the only people who play head games.
they act shy around you but they are really really nice.
you have questions about self doubt.
don't worry, there are still plenty of years ahead of you.
personally, i would not care either way.
my motto is, "say what you mean and mean what you say."
i am a good -looking twenty-five year old male with a daughter.
should i tell her that information and then dump her for her mother?
next someone will want to marry a tree.
men enjoy conversing and especially appreciate it when a woman approaches them.
she will be surprised to find out you listened to her.
good women are interested in good men.
there is a man at school that i like and am interested in.
meet for drinks at the snco or o'club.
do you see what went wrong in this picture?
i wonder what the east coast looks like.
you are not missing out, he is.
in my opinion, soulmates do not exist.
there are features that function and features that do not.
rehashing the various causes (lying, other men, mutual obligations) will not ease our pain.
well, because we are girls!
buy him a brand new sky blue car with key chains!
but it seems like lately we do nothing but argue and disagree.
make them look as if they are okay at it, if they are better than you, really all you want.
frankly, even homosexuals would dump you in a second!
also, you know it's unjust to get involved with someone else's spouse.
ask yourself these questions, am i enjoying life?
do not flirt too much or you may end up in bed the same night.
i am into this relationship and i want to impress my lady with little to no fault of mine.
you can call the summer camp and con your way into getting her information.
the girl and i never see eachother anymore.
you would not go if you did not become a lesbian.
ladies and gentlemen, did you always enjoy your time and what was the most number of times it was enjoyed?
when you have matured, interdependence may be an option for you.
but was his love for her actually love?
if it's the real thing, love is beautiful.
it's possible that he has not encountered her yet.
listen to bearhead, that'll will help.
i'm going to terminate speaking immediately.
i have a question. would you have sex immediately after consuming nine thousand doughnuts?
you should utilize protection regardless of your decision.
beauty shouldn't play a portion in how much we like someone, but it's nature.
naturally it is easier to run.
the 'strong and silent' strategy has always been successful in my experience.
don't put the blame on her, blame her mom or dad.
just be a man and ask her on a date.
i love well-dressed girls with long hair.
it sounds like you're in love with him.
i have an undesirable job, my automobile is problemetic, and i'm facing a lawsuit. also i'm dealing with issues with my apartment.
you need to tell him why you dislike him, and be nice without seeming like you rehearsed it.
you go to school with people called peers, and get to know them.
when i arrived home, he was still there, asleep.
i do not mean that you ahve done anything wrong per se, you jsut can not read his mind.
it is like a big sign that says i am easy.
realistically i have 3-5 times per week.
what i mean is, how do you ask someone out, but do not care about their answer.
if you have not had sex, sooner or later he will want to.
no, not unless you have already given a chance to be with this soulmate and it didn't end up perfect.
it depends on what he enjoys.
hello, ms. jasmine, first of all, is anyone aware why he is doing that?
they need medication, they need to go visit a doctor.
most best friends that have been in a relationship are not best friends anymore.
pretty dumb that i asked it!

if it is assault or battery, etc.
make sure it is fun!
how long were they dating? what was the nature of their relationship?
whether girls admit it or not, they do find men attractive when they are not afraid to show their true feelings!
that is fine with me as long as she is at least 18 years old.
it sounds like he is only interested in her for carnal reasons.
yes and no, but they love it.
they are welcome to send me an email with a picture if there is one.
i enjoy spending time with you.
as i tell my fiancee, "if i say it's beautiful, then it is beautiful."
experiencing love can cause emotional pain, but that pain can teach one and make one stronger.
if it is only for one night, i would suggest you enjoy it.
i am having a hard time finding a heterosexual man in any location.
it is healthy to be friends with your ex-partner.
may i ask how long you have been dating her?
most likely, but this is common among humans.
that was a joke, i prefer loose fitting undergarments.
yes, wear them, or sell them and purchase something nice for yourself.
also, no i am in good shape and quite successful.
i will leave the remaining to your judgement.
love is more powerful than money.
if he does not, you may be in a better position.
he will share if he likes you.
i figure it would happen at the time of your marriage.
i do not intended for one night only.
or hire a professional escort, if you're more adventurous hire a porn actress.
there are low-cost hand-held video games that don't cost anymore than five dollars.
you're old enough there is not much you can do to claim him as yours, and you probably could not even if you wanted to.
good luck in your future endeavors.
what is your relationship with this person?
there's no need to complain about honest men.
make sure you spend a lot of time on it, otherwise you will lose it.
i told him we would do what you have planned.
they do not like it, they love it.
love is a game in which no doctor can explain.  it tickles and affects the brain.
what can i do to make him want me again?
you do not, unless you ask her out.
they can be found everywhere if you know where to look.
not a girl who worries and doesn't try asking.
i am not infatuated by overweight girls, although i do adore them.
he has poor hygiene, is rude, and is aggressive so if you are fine with that then go ahead and date him.
i figured out the difficult way.
other than that i believe it is awesome!
just be sure he is the one for you!
i'll send pictures if you don't trust me.
well, if you guys are sleeping together already, get her a love swing, great times.
i met her a long time ago.
do not listen to her because she is a lesbian.
just tell her to forget about him, and if he beats you up then tell him that you will call the police.
nature is a man with a woman.
some people like it or love it, and other people hate it.
please, do not bring it up again.
have you ever gone a whole night out without sleeping because you are so in love right now.
if he did not hear your question, bring it up again.
some girls like that but i think most do not.
do you spend time with your girlfriend?
i will marry you girl, but what if you are not good in bed?
that is the nature of a woman!
if he says no then they are yours to keep.
six months later and he is still so egotistical.
some men want to live with the women they love because they want to make love with them.
i do not interact with individuals who behave in that manner.
he just needs some time alone.  in fairness, why don't you call him?
i love you.  will you marry me?
i doesn't seem wrong to me.
if it is not really good, do not let it ruin something that is good.
i am 12 years old and i used to have a crush on my 27-year old social studies teacher.
most guys think there is something better out there but they want to keep you as well.
if it does i am cheating way too much.
the problem is that i was involved with his friend and now i feel bad. what should i do?
stop cheating before you hurt someone!
people who appreciate cliches would say this person is interested in you, but it is no more than a battle.
i am unwed, wealthy, very attractive, and greatly appreciated by women.
when she seems to be enjoying your company, ask her on a date.
yes, love can be painful, but it can also not be painful.
so you know, this courting will not lead to physical contact, or my response will be negative.
i feel like we are no longer best-friends.
you should never make assumptions, if you want to know the answer just ask.
that is what marriage is all about.
i wish i could change what happened.
do not worry about the young men because they will get old, too!
i would like to obtain her phone number.
i dated a large number of women.
walk up to one and say, "kiss me!".
get a girlfriend in your city.
let her know that you care.
everyone i know said i was too young to be in love.
i'm happy and in love with this man.
it's not polite to disturb girls on a date.
you should end the relationship with your husband as soon as possible.
that is what attracts them to most women.
1.  make her love you deeply.
deal with it and take it in stride.
it sounds like a lot of fun, but being married is not cool.
is it possible he doesn't want to discuss some bigger issue he's having?
allow yourself the time it takes to get over someone.
follow these steps to effectively communicate with her. avoid acting shy. walk confidently towards her. look into her eyes when speaking. make polite conversation. compliment everything about her.
if a person doesn't seem willing or interested in spending their free time with you, then you shouldn't waste any time trying to develop a relationship with them.
those who seem to be lacking knowledge about the bible can answer another question.
thank you for the compliment, but i am not looking for any kind of relationship at this time.
individuals mature at different ages, and some never mature.
you are not ready for that at this time.
then, he would be able to feel the same way that you feel.
i do not think that i want to.
basically, if we go through with it, ultimately we will be just kidding with you.
i currently do not reside in ohio, however, i do have family there.
of course they were both in relationships.
unfortunately, it is human nature that there are many people who are not genuine, and use others.
it's too bad that you forgot the thong and do not realize how sexy a male thong can be.
for whom are you searching, where does he live and why are you looking for him?
my husband is a man like that.
tinamaries43, happy new year.
this whole marriage thing!
honey, i feel for you because i went through the same thing myself. men see things differently than women do.
but if you don't believe in god then i guess you won't care about this argument.
you cannot force somebody to like you.
my friends told me that it is a sin to be gay and i want to know if it is true or not.
afternoon, morning, night, who cares? it is sex.
because we do not want to give it up and be that week
it is my opinion that most females prefer a man who is taller than she is.
if you know the answer, then perhaps you can give me clue.
perhaps you should allow her to win a time or two.
listen to some heavy metal music while you relax and take a break from the stresses of the holidays.
i have never had an undesirable breakup, nor have i dated the same female twice.
i am aware of several men that do.
i will only speak with shelly on this forum.
i love my girlfriend very much.
i'd rather us be friends than nothing.
there are a lot of things.  attention whores, for example.
girls often don't show a preference about the height of potential partners.
don't be overly coy.
make decisions that are based on your best interests and your feelings!  good luck!
maybe not if you aren't very familiar with this area.
in relationships, body language communicates a great deal for both males and females.
why do they change the meaning of every sentence you speak?
yes, we do it on purpose. some women no longer have need of men.
but my wife will not take the garbage outside.
i do not believe i was ever like that.
a few places where it is not wise to meet a future partner are: alcoholics anonymous meetings, in the court system, at a marriage counselor's office, at the hospital, etc.
i have had a best friend since i was six years of age and we're still best friends, now that i'm sixteen years old.
once we both realized that the break up was a falsehood, i found that i felt unclear about where things stand.
i think the reason might be that no one has been intimate with her lately.
i generally have three times a week available but it depends on how many times you would like.  i think 5 days from the 7th is available.
no, i actually find that it is important to take a vacation every now and then.
there is no way. do not listen to the words of people who do not like you.
you should focus more on his/her personality.
stop putting so much effort into it. if you keep that up, he will leave you.
if there are times when you feel tension, then he is most likely interested in you.
another one who is your own age, woman, not a fifty-six year old.
generally speaking, anyone younger than that would not be acceptable.
if he pays well, sell them as soon as possible.
i am actually a really good looking and well educated man.
for a man 23 to 28 years old and for a female 20 to 28 years old.
well, it says so in the bible, but i am not sure.  that is disgusting.
how often would depend on how attractive she is.
i am wondering if a girl can become pregnant if you withdraw during sex before you climax.
do not worry about if he will want to be with you if you are attractive, because all guys would want to be with you.
i went out with a woman who drank too much alcohol and became very drunk.
that would definitely qualify as the wrong time.
if you are using protection and have not had a baby yet then keep doing what you are doing.
at school i talk to him more than i talk to my own boyfriend.
then you should just throw him out because he is useless.
i wonder what type of person has to pay for sex.
i guess that we will never know until we ask him.
yes i am in a relationship with a man younger than i, however our relationship is fine.
men do not lose any thing after a sexual encounter, however ladies lose most.
do not be angry and calm your emotions.
additionally, forget the past as it can not return.
provide him with beer and allow him to become inebriated.
now when i see him, all we do is stare.
the truth hurts; that is the way it is.
how can i meet other fifteen year olds?
chopdown101, that site is really horrific.
yes, i think you get the picture.
believe your mind first, and be sure to put your heart last.
ask however you would like, but be very cautious with that step.
first, say "hello my name is", then say "your name is?", and go from there.

are stealth settings similar to the ignore button?
it's mainly his choice, but i just can't seem to get him off of my mind.
i tell myself it would never have worked because we had differences with my kids, among other things.
when i realize that someone such as yourself cares to ask me that.
most people don't understand that.
i don't like you.
then you know what is going to happen.
because you are thinking he is not well.
say mon cheri (mon shay ree) to a man.
you have a very neat necklace.
i did not like the french way. it felt too inappropriate.
not very good because it looks like many people already did.
if those days matter to you, then you will not want to carry on the very bad ones now.
these days, women should take control of anything related to the wedding.
she will also think of it as sort of obscene that she had sex with someone that her best friend did as well.
you cannot. it is no longer an option.
about four to five times per week.
never try to be mean. this would only make matters worse.
i believe she takes an interest in boys.
i am not sure about other women, but most women that i have come into contact with are interested in men that has a good sense of humor.
when i am in an area that consist of many people, i feel overwhelmed. do you understand why?
there are some women instincts that would alert them in their mind.
the foot massage must be good. it made you feel great!
never use a pick up line on someone no matter how humorous it may seem.
you ought to only have sex if you are married.
via instant messenger is a good method if you do not care for him overly much.
i would definitely agree for true love.
however, that did not prevent me from having the best one-night stand i have ever had.
affirmative ... and expelled gas, as well ... however, in occurrences on two separate episodes.
it is simply your requirement to locate our position.
the entirety of our group is homosexual ... it entirely consists of what one's individual preference may or may not be.
if she basically desires non-serious sexual relations with you as a partner, simply derive pleasure from the experience.
simply utter i am enamored of you, as well.
go for a walk in the park and feed some geese, or doing something similar.
when was this golden age?
i believe a kiss is harmless, regardless of age.
the worst part of it is that she will not answer her telephone or explain in emails.
i believe that dee- down no one cares about others, and they prefer to wallow in self-pity.
it will find you. that's the only way.
however, i'm old-fashioned and think that is appropriate.
let us vote and put it to rest?
why do men commit infidelity when they are in a good relationship?
you will want to take action on this before anyone else does!
it is because men are attracted to women and vice versa, which is the way of the world - you should try it!
this is difficult advice to hear and to follow, but in my opinion the best thing to do would be to start dating again.
i had lunch with a man today and he was nice, but we are not exclusive and i am still talking to other men, as well.
it is possible that you are not trendy enough.
you should be confident, do not think negative thoughts, and make your mind a positive place.
i want you to choose the restaurant, but tell everyone that i chose this; only because i want the very best for you.
if she was not interested, she would not give what you say or do a single thought.
i decided to leave her and find a much more suitable mate.
only since they get the male species aroused.
thongs are underwear or swimsuits, and a g-string is lingerie. however, both have very thin strips of fabric across the buttocks.
perhaps he had it on there and forgot it?
if that's what they want, i think they would.
i awoke with his body on top of mine and his penis inside me.
he is a mean person. do not associate with him.
i found the person who i was destined to be a bit too late.
i am still reach out to one of those women occasionally to have drinks together
many gay people will not admit that they are gay.
however, my point is that you must tell him.
typically it means that the cat or dog needs to urinate for the night before going to bed.
you would not buy a pair of shoes without trying them on so why should sex be any different.
move on if you are not happy.
i am hoping my friend was right when she said this is normal.
now i would be all for it if it was an artist who modeled on the side.
i gave up looking for the love of my life and then he walked in.
let him watch some adult movies. just joking. ask him what will make him stop.
please do not feel bad. you should feel good instead.
who dies on their own free will?
i would be worried and question it if i were you.
don't ask me if i love you if you can't reciprocate.
you should ask her if it is alright.
you only see her as an option if your first choice falls through.
if you do not, you will feel as if you lost out on an important and beautiful relationship.
if you don't let the issue go, it will make him leave.
what you are doing is wrong and will not end well.
avoid it at all costs.
you just have to learn their language.
i enjoy good coffee during sunny days.
it is because english is not my native language.
i want my dress back without any drama.
aren't there enough problems in this world already?
let me think about that a moment. no, absolutely not!
do not ask her if it is okay, just do it.
hello my dear friend, do not worry.
from what i have seen, my answer is that most men do not.
do it the same way a single mother does!
i, like most men, think it is sexy when a girl is a virgin.
that is difficult, as it is an odd arrangement.
watch "40 year old virgin" as that movie is very funny and you will learn something from it.
second, it does not really matter what you do since he is going to be feeling hurt no matter what happens.
ask your ex-boyfriend whether it is fine for me to date other men while i'm still with you.
you can be very sweet and kind!
we have been together for four years now.
hooking up is easy when you are drunk.
tell them you found someone who makes you very happy.
put down the magazines and leave your house!
did i just cheat on him?
you also might want to talk to him and see if he likes you in the same way as you like him.
next time you are in bed, ask her if she wants you to use the vibrator on her.
and she is wonderfu; is it the part-time job you do not like?
some men just want to have fun while others want a committed relationship.
how do you know so much?
it is hard to forget what happened to the both of you.
if it passes, then let it go.
if you choose to meet the man, that is when it becomes dangerous.
no, my dear, this is not disloyalty.
simply try to keep in mind that it is their loss rather than yours.
both men and women. the difference is that men more strongly desire sex while for women commitment is also important.
in 10 years, when he has gained weight, you can look back at this with humor.
it does not look good. there are a few in circulation; however they are not easy to find.
the holiday season is upon us, which gives me reason to ask.
i would leave her immediately. she is not worth it!
that is, if others are not happy but you are.
that is not it. all you want from it is that special feeling.
feelings of romantic love entail an abundance beyond that. it exists such that you simply enjoy co-mingling, co-working, and placing faith in one's survival
the majority of male people have the ability to feel less concern regarding their future as betrothed or not betrothed.
might possibly exist upon the roadway.
you have previously been equipped with knowledge regarding your most beneficial subsequent actions.
have you no desire to provide assistance to the gentleman?
find out if she is your type.
call her and tell her that you love her.
do you suspect he might not feel the dame way?
casablanca. i can't believe i'm the first person to tag this one.
that isn't fair. wouldn't you hate it if someone did the same to you?
it almost broke me down, because he said our love was never ending and i loved him very much.
because you are dating the wrong people.
i am very lucky to have him.
however, do not worry, there are still some good guys out here.
in my experience,  love always seems to come , y way when i lwast expect or want it.
then, hurry up and leave quickly, and do not forget the children!
well, good luck, and just so you are aware, i would think it was over the limit too.
i admire jennifer love hewitt and jessica alba, and often have fantasies of them.
it is time for you to not be selfish and let him move on with someone who appreciates him.
it might work to casually start a conversation about diamonds.
let us go to bed together.
should i ask the meaning of what he said?
i think she likes you if she smiles when you show her your penis.
if you are worried you should take a paternity test.
what is the age of everyone on here?
tell her that you need privacy, some alone time; possibly a short break.
you never know the outcome unless you try.
do not forget that no man is more important than your sister.
it was an outdoor wedding with many colorful flowers, jewel tone fabrics, and no silk florals.
it could be anything, but he is just too scared to tell you.
if you entice him by showing some skin, you will have sure fire success.
afterwards, they'll be feeling so great and relaxed, they'll be ready to thank him.
since the 49-52 age group is so small, you should look at the 40-60 age group instead.
it is in actuality less fear-inducing than it may appear.
you are mandated to provide for her a time place for a social meal.
relationship dissolutions are difficult, however you will locate the individual that serves as your lifetime romantic ideal.
complication exists, i continue to experience intense emotional affection for her.
it is imperative that you extract yourself from interactions with your current male significant other; the situation is merely continuing to deteriorate originating from this point.
do not let her convince you with her womanly wiles that it is not.
what is it that i should do now?
the only guy here is the secretary and he is not attractive and probably about 25 years older than me.
it depends on if the man truly likes the woman or not.
it is not being disloyal, it is merely starting to or trying to be disloyal.
you ought to begin your life anew.
in that case, you ought to invite him to study with you at the library.
a $10 gift card for the thrift store might be appropriate.
each time i peer into my girlfriend's eyes, i am able to see the beach.
you do not have love without a lover.
is he certain that he approves of that?
you must simply be yourself.
i do not believe in the lifestyle.
i would take a moment to collect your thoughts and then try to cuddle with him.
i am not not bothered by the cost diamonds or my wedding ring.
no, it is not bad.
i would refrain from looking around and simply continue with the initial boyfriend.
that is easy; ask yourself if you would die for him.
but i also want to be with my husband and children.
so we have ascertained that you and she have the same taste in men.
do not make a fast move but be sure to use what you have--conversation.
people will read whatever they can find.
a friend of mine was unfaithful and the victim of her infidelity despises her.
but becoming enamored with everyone is not something i feel to be right.
if you petition me in a polite manner, i will acquiesce.
remember: there are distinct social and emotional differences between men and women.
because it can take a lot of effort to deal with your group at times.
have you any desire to be wed?
heck, your history of being acquainted with him covers a period of one half-decade.
the more animalistic, the greater in terms of desirability. i have no wish to exist as the type of individual who simply rests prostrate.
compellingly not one single individual from the group would agree to the challenge of romantic courtship with an african american male.
you proceed, female person, and protect your own self interests, you aurally processed my exhortations!
men don't care to tell them romanticisms.
whatever jason says will lead to animosity and will not be effective.
it will be barefoot on the beach with my family and a few close friends.
before you assume that she is cheating, do some investigation.
should i give him an ultimatum?
shame on you if you trick me.
should i keep waiting?
yes, i have a strong friendship with them.
if his answer is yes then you should reject him.
if it is less than that, then the answer is no!
sexual or intimate conversation with anyone other than your spouse is infidelity.
we women are just starting what the men were doing years ago.
everybody does it. try it. it's great.
take a break from your other relationship until your divorce is final.
i have yet to discover the same.
that is particularly true if you are not the real feminine kind.
there are a lot of things to think about first.
the female brain is far too complex for that!
it may sound superficial, but do wear nice shoes!
however, on the other hand, women can certainly be devious sometimes.
it is the sixth string on a guitar.
you should ask him promptly.
instead, you should wait for your true love to find you.
you should enjoy life and find another person because there are many available.
please maintain a presence if he does not move in with the girls.
initially, try to work for little compensation.
do not purchase a gift for your ex-significant other.
love is about the full picture of your relationship, not the size of your significant other's genitals.
life is too important to stop striving for meaning and success, always perservere.
please take your time to think it over.
if you are simply conversating about normal things with no ill intentions, then it is fine.
that man you have feelings for is also homosexual?
if you even have to ask that question, it is time to walk away.
honestly, if they did, then you would think that they would be fascinated by the fact that we have them as well.
she had no desire to cease performing the action.
my male significant other and myself simply fail to enjoy a large amount of pleasant diversions.
i believe if you inquire of a given random female, however respect would most appropriately occupy the number one position on a any summation comprised by whomever.
failing to experience any general amount of pleasure at this moment, would you be?
yourself, as well as your companion, possess a necessity to maintain silence.
however, i do not know whether it is my fault or society's fault.
because they are women they have vaginas and bottoms, that's why.
i could not stop thinking about the other man until the one i love came home.
however, sex is a bigger issue.
ask someone who really knows what love is: does love change?
some men and women are unable to say "no".
men and women are similar.
it is a good sign if your love interest accepts a second date.
how can i enjoy the sexual part of our relationship?
except for instances where you and your partner are short on time, going slow in a sexual encounter is preferable to going too quickly.
i would wager that she would desire you then.
you ought to look for a man to whom you are not attracted.
if their happiness is more important to you than your own.
i am a married man who enjoys pornography featuring trasgendered women.
if you do not hold the opinion that that is infidelity, then no, you do not.
you should move if they can not handle or adapt to the situation.
she uses it based on whether you are good enough for her.
email, call, or leave a message to ask.
is she intoxicated and laying down?
it is right next to your heart.
whatever he asked you, ask him the same thing.
ask yourself if you continually fall in love with people who are considered "forbidden fruit."
is it so you do not get caught looking?
he told me that he is trying to wait it out with her.
they should eat dinner together and then after, watch a film.
yes, people participate in that activity on the internet daily.
cheap trick says that if you want me to show an interest in you, you should rate me as a 10 and i would appreciate it.
alternately, if you are afraid that he will reject you, you can tell a friend of his that you are interested in him.
are you confident that you know the subject you mentioned well?
do not talk to him about other men that you like or are dating. that will only hurt him more.
men like both women's personality and looks.
it does not matter how many times you have performed sexual intercourse, i would not use that as a consideration at all.
a man that takes the lead and stays in control.
so you can please her enough for her to forget about her vibrator.
check your myspace if you are mostly interesed in your appearence.
all he want is to get is his green card.
you need to enjoy it and do your best.
there is nothing to worry about.
men think we all aresimple people.
due to the fact that certain individuals do not like other individuals.
yes, where have you been inquiring for the last ten years?
i am sorry but cannot respond at this time on messenger.
due to the fact no one told them to be dishonest.
please remember that your family loves you and will continue to always love you.
you leave everything in disarray and then expect us to fix the problem.
you ought to tell him the bitter reality, slowly, hand in hand.
if you need to dismiss him then you ought to do that.
no, i met my partner online and we have been together for four years now.
i wrote him a note but he did not reply.
if you really love him, just go ask him whether he feels the same way or not.
not french. french is the most beautiful sounding language, the language of love.
wow. i know how you feel.
it would be wrong, though, if you actually did it.
a quiet talk would work well if she is just flirting.
you feel suspiciously towards that male individual; otherwise, your queries would be kept to a minimum.
however, take stock in my declaration: not every single female has a propensity for flirtatious behavior.
fail to recall that female combined with a modicum of saliva - even someone as distasteful as she is not deserving of such treatment.
the male of the female does not possess value to make the actions profitable.
the 24-hour period during which she is not positively inclined to possessing it, possibly following several hundred ... or does she retain the ability to perform simple calculations subsequent to such an event!
i attempted to call, but he is either not home or no one is answering.
you cannot force him to make him desire you in his life.
rape is sex without your consent; unfortunately he raped you.
a divine rule; if you are unfaithful, you will attract some who is unfaithful as well.
how do i aquire a male lover?
it is always appropriate to tell a person that you love them even if you do not.
true love. money will fade away but true love will not.
do not become involved and ruin a marriage.
if you must begin counting your toes.
after you greet her, you ought to try to demonstrate what your personality is. (i believe personality is important.)
maybe, give her a flower today then a present on christmas.
an ideal wedding location would be near a beach during sunset.
there will continually be someone for everyone.
share our gathered thoughts and love.
in the great words of sir mix alot, "i enjoy large behinds and i cannot tell a lie, while you other brothers cannot deny."
you should tell her that you truly care.
i do believe in falling in love with someone online!
do not be afraid to take action.
i am aware of where you live so i will come over to your house.
the plan didn't work out how i had imagined but it was still worth the effort!
give him flowers and a kiss good bye.
it sounds as though we are in the same boat.
i would go with the artist.
the word friend tells the story. fry end, do i need to explain further?
i told him i do not like him and he said he does not like me either
please take your child and leave that man.
i graduated in my final year.
did he ever provide a reason to be?
happiness is very important.
i am not sure if you will be able to trust him.
you should not have any other men around.
sometimes it is important to continue looking for someone else.
i sometime allow my two childern to play in a tree.
do you have any more specific questions rather than just open one?
getting married will not change things.
there is a major difference between having a crush and being in love.
he is rude, so you do not want to associate with people like him.
my mother always said not to talk to strangers.
if you are anything like i am; once you love someone, you always love someone.
men find something in a woman that they love and it may not be their eyes that attracts them.
please put your trust in me as this is successful most of the time. good luck to you!
i am going to bring my family with me because i am not unintelligent.
you should put the computer away and try to interact with the other people in your life.
you should talk to him about that because if he loves you, he will understand.
do you realize what you have just said?
if you visit a latino website, you can meet other people there.
they want to waste your time.
he doesn't like you that way.
be rude if he doesn't give up.
because that's how they will think of us also.
banana cream pie is what it tasted like!
since you've pointed that out i see it too!
i would not advise ogling the girlfriend of someone else.
i am assuming that you are a woman.
now move away from the computer, mister.
in addition, compare them with a list of what you like and do not like about this person.
you need to ask yourself why he is not leaving if he loves you so much.
for three years i have wanted to start a relationship with a this guy.
i once talked to my gay friend about how to be safe so he would not get aids.
i will keep it to three things to save time.
although you need to be honest to your husband and love his family, it is not necessary to tell him everything.
if he does not understand that you accidentally jumped to conclusions then you should consider not seeing him anymore.
it is best if you do what your heart tells you to.
there are great dating sites out there.
she would definitely want you to.
after reading it, i see no chance at all.
i do not know how to lie nor do i wish to know either.
this is akin to asking someone's sexuality.
no need to look when you can just have fun with the company of friends.
or do you believe in online romance?
maybe they will invite you to their home to have fun.
be cautious with who you accompany.
i like being brunette more, who said that blondes have more fun?
if you're an dunce you would keep posting irrelevant things, right?
my advice for you is to tell him your true feelings.
he will be a waste of your time.
is there really no way that you can be together?
brunette hair coloring, most definitely ... who made the comment stating that blonde-haired individuals experience a greater number of enjoyable diversions?
in the event that you are a simpleminded individual, continue generating internet postings, agreed?
well, my recommendation consists of an admonition to relate to him your emotions.
he will fail to measure up to the value inherent in any given moment of your ongoing existence.
no situation exists in which both of you individuals would be enabled to commingle?
although reality sets in, you are always happy.
it was a nice dinner, movie and soft kiss.
i never miss an opportunity to inform her.
are you eager about this idea?
it was another way to make the bedroom interesting.
simply tell them that you are not looking for marriage currently.
what tone should i use when speaking to him?
it has a history as long as humanity does.
i wish you luck and you should remember that it is never your fault.
because they feel a particular way and they want to engage in activities that i am certain you can guess.
it's extremely visually appealing, might possibly be difficult to obtain however.
at the moment in which she opines, "negative," do not function in a stalking capacity. such behavior will merely irritate you and result in negative circumstances.
i surmise she barely eluded crossing paths with her male offspring.
1. for no individuals to ever become ill and perish, to only pass away due to natural causes.
i was curious as to whether or not you wished to accompany me to the cinema this coming friday?
that sounds beautiful in principle, but it might be difficult to find in real life.
when she says no, do not stalk her. that will only annoy her and get you into trouble.
i think she just missed her son.
would you like to see a movie with me on friday?
there are issues with trust in their relationship.
i am looking for an attractive woman who is humble and has a great attitude. maybe it is you.

did you know that warm cocoa makes people feel loved?
you should set things straight with her.
when speaking with someone, try to be yourself. start a conversation and hope for the best.
i do not know what else to say besides trust your own judgement.
even though she cheated on me, i love her because of her courage.
i wanted to kiss him but with no tongue. i told him i didn't like that.
you won't know unless you try it.
if that had happened to me, i would not be able to overcome it for a while.
my apologies. do you reside in theran?
if they truly love you, they will care about your well-being.
no, but did i say that i had flatulence?
when you are in the vicinity, she has a tendency to become shy.
you should show her who you truly are!
was that before you decided to end your relationship with him?
which mental hospital do you visit?
i don't think many of those people are very smart because they have relied on their looks to get what they want.
it is blond. blonds tend to have an angelic look, but it need not be an innocent one.
do not call with excessive frequency.
give those items to her and leave.
however, half of them were not proficient lovers, and those experiences felt like a waste of my time.
inform her that you trust her judgment and that she is your focus.
you are simple frequenting the incorrect locations.
actions which most males undertake as a method to cause emotional pain... inform me...
given your desire to avoid emerging in anything less than first place, simply invest her with self-assuring trustworthiness.
they are also under the impression that they desire a husband with a talent for lending an ear.
i believe that it is more widely acquiesced to that males practice infidelity.
in the first instance she should not act that way.
giving gifts is not a test of whether love is true.
she appears to be someone with whom you could have a quiet conversation.
if he asked to resume our relationship, i would probably want to do so even though that would be unwise.
althought it is simply my opinion, it appears to be your belief as well.
act naturally. if she isn't impressed, she's not the best choice for you personally.
well, females have a number of nonsensical thoughts.
it's very rare for a female to use an obvious pickup line on a male.
well, i chortled as well, but i agree it's a bad date.
it's possible he had that there prior to beginning his search for a girlfriend.
please have a couple of beers first.
i would not tell him that you received a message from a guy because that might make him feel bad.
if you have really good sex with a man, does that make him want to keep coming back to you?

i am going to wait for five or six years after i get engaged.
he will regret his decision.

i was doing it because i loved him, not for the money.
have your friend discover whether or not she likes you, and then take it from there.
then proceed to have sexual intercourse over the internet through webcams.
or you could do what the other man said. large members work as well.
however, don't go in so fastly.
you should not have to try to get a boyfriend. it should happen on its own.
we men only think of the easiest way to have sexual intercourse.
just be yourself and treat ner nice. give her a date she will never forget.
that was a big mistake.
women like to receive compliments.
try to flirt, then stop flirting.
in even that case your best approach would be child support.

if you give her a red bull, she will fly away in the way it is portrayed in the advertisement.

a ring is merely a ring.
i would not tolerate it if he were to suggest marriage because marriage is permanent.

i have fondness for this female and i have yet to communicate with her, up to this point.
when nothing you do is every wrong in his eyes.
i find it funny that most men have nothing to flirt with.
first off, i can say my girl friend is not on the road.
whatever his reason may be, just remember that it is his reason.
i never hear from him again, and then on christmas day nearly two years later i learned he had died.
when men like me say they like you, they meant that you are one of ten women that we like.

men who are unfaithful are secretly homosexual.

i haven't, although i've always really wanted to.
i prefer older men, or the same age as myself.
she is an apple computer while you are a personal computer, if you understand what i am telling you.
you should go out and meet new women.
it would not be bad if you dressed nicely and had your hair done.

the answer depends on how old you are and where you want him to kiss you.
naturally, it always helps to have someone nice to start dating.
just because he is good to your son does not mean he is good for you and to you.
you are just using him, if you are not.
personally, i would not worry about it.
perhaps it is because many people do not believe that they can.

even if you choose not to send the words, just writing things down allows you to think them out properly before acting.

that does not matter if two males or females truly care for one another.
if his only reason for responding is due to his polite nature, that is acceptable as well, do not ponder on the matter too much.
introduce him to a girl that hopefully will like him, then encourage their relationship to bloom.
if i were you, i wouldn't do it.
he loves you or he doesn't love you.
if you don't want to have sex, don't.
it depends on how you feel when it's over.
get his number and send him messages every now and then.
don't be cheap in first sight.
or what have you been up to now that you weren't doing before.
do you get anxious every time the person calls?
it seems you enjoy him already, so admit to him what your heart is saying.

as long as you are happy and you are doing what you want and getting what you need.
but things that obviously upset her i've put a halt to, and now she hardly gets jealous.
i've gave it a shot once but he knew it was me immediately.
i asked a guy out and he said we should sometime.
is it just something you want, or is it really something you need.
he undertakes many tasks for me.
if your significant other is cheating or saddening you, are you supposed to stay together?
i will inform you of this.
it was as if my body ruptured.
any chat program has rooms such as this.
women do not pay, but men pay enough to make it worthwhile economically.
even during sad times, i want to smile and enjoy every minute.  we will keep our 'wits.'
i want to know what you guys think of this.
a question for other men: would you purchase your girlfriend a ring with her birthstone or choose a more traditional diamond?
i must admit that i'm a bit confused by the blog epidemic.
i am disgusted by drinking, and any sort of smoking.
it is not fair to him if you continue to date him when you have no interest in marrying him.
men are not alone in having extramarital affairs -- people are unfaithful because they are not happy.
girls often get serious about it, as long as they know you are serious.
i frequently ask myself the same question.
i suggest that you find some friends to spend time with in order to get her out of your mind.
it is nothing fancy, you can eat the food with your fingers, and have some fun.
may i ask why you call yourself darkangle?
is it possible that there is a problem with me?
i am in the front row at the concert. "love gun" by kiss has a contrasting meaning to me.
you ask, "why do men do this"?
you both love each other.

please consider ending the relationship.
let me reiterate, waiting for marriage is the appropriate thing to do.
agree and say you've never considered that perspective before.
she will call you back after you contact her first.
i prefer gentlemen, not scoundrals.
even the perfect gentleman isn't so perfect.
depends on whether you are going after the good guys, or the bad ones.
best exclaimed in the movie "old school love", "it's terrible".
she wouldn't dare be with another if it is.
not all women have this same mindset, just your women.
i am not doing it, someone else will do it.
i could look at this person forever.
she loves you for that.
begin a conversation during pillow time with each other.
that is not good, it makes all of us look bad.
i stopped it quickly, but he tells me not to worry and that he stopped telling her he loved her.
no, it is because your parents care about you and do not want anything bad to happen to you.
honestly, for better or worse was the vow you made.
he says "i have business trips all over the place lately".
why do you need a man to take care of you?
if he does then you should consider dating him.
doing that is just asking to get hurt.
how does he act towards other people when you
depending on the time of year, he may be shopping.
i really like him but i'm trying to get over it and be a friend.
if he would please do those things without asking, it would be great.
you should consider it to be nature's free gift to everyong.
she is willing to share her lunch with you.
it is acceptable, providing that you look carefully.
the truth of the matter is that i want one.

it's acceptable so long as they are at least 18 years of age.
guys don't care for problems and things like it.
the child they already have.
i adore him for just being who he is.
and could it be possible that he really adores me?
they will always protect you no matter what.
good luck, and congrats on the 2 year anniversary.
my boyfriend did those things all the time
if only we could have multiple!
did i say that i think he's attractive?
i have the same issue with my mother at the moment, but we are trying to reach a resolution.
marriage is a lifelong decision, my friend!
yes, it does for a guy like me with a thick, 10-inch penis!
trouble related to love and relationships.
introducing the bride and the groom, cutting the cake, eating dinner, dancing, etc.
i have the same problem with my mom right now, but we are getting there.
marriage is for life, my friend!
yes it does, if it is a guy like me with a thick, ten inch penis.
if you think like that, you should definitely stay offline.
i never have a boyfriend, i fall in love quickly, and frighten them away.
i don't want to end up losing the only best friend i ever had!
the purpose is to let their emotions out, while you listen.
that's definitely because love is blind.
let me assure you that this is not a joke.
a small number of tatoos are acceptable and certain piercings are very attractive.
i prefer that he never buy me flowers.
i suggest you stop attempting to line up a date online and refrain from using the computer.
take out the trash, pick up your underwear, and state i love you at least twice per day.
using a cucumber, and a can of shaving cream.
that's when you hand her your american express card.
it's to stop anybody from getting injured.
a girlfriend with a nice body and a great personality.
try to get his schedule to find out if you like him.
touching each other is very close to breaking the rules.
it is likely that he will go back.
try not to be too harsh when you are reprimanding him.
someone who is both smart and funny.
it is just going to make them angry.
you cannot get a guy to like you, and there is no need to.
simply do not spend time with them.
if you slept with her mother or sister, you are not going to get her back.
i cannot speak for all women, but i am sure i do.
either way, you should not worry about it.
your boyfriend will not let you have one.
he should think you are the sexy one.
try to do things that will take your mind off him.
it is not just your own perfection you have to cope with, it is everybody else's too.
it is the normal appearing people that you should be careful with.
this may not be a smart question. if she does not like you, why did she let you kiss her?
you can not live your life only to make other people happy.
i am affectionate of him. i would do anything to make sure he is content.
if girls do not feel an emotional connection with their lover, the relationship will not go on.
are you confused if you desire one?
he will be in trouble if he does not remain silent about the matter.
others have told me that it is not usual in our society to have only one friend and for that friend to be female.
loving him requires that you trust him implicitly.
i doubt that you will be able to cope with the disapproval of the others.
i believe in lust at first sight, but love?
it depends on the girl.
you should always be the person that you are.
if you are not comfortable with that, then make a joke and say, "wouldn't that be weird if we went out?"
how can working out make you stronger?
life is a mix of good and bad, but it is not always 50/50.
turn on to bc grant rd, then go one mile to 11th.
tell her that even though you are apart, you can still be friends.
don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with.
if you bring a girl to orgasm, she wont leave you.
it is up to the guy if he is interested.
if you have to ask, then he doesn't.
maybe you're a good kisser and you simply don't know that you are.
anywhere the two of you want to.
if so, he probably feels obligated.
how can i break up with someone like that and they turn around and spend $108 on a birthday gift for me?
you could always get married.  no, wait, do then you'll never get laid!
if you are not married, you should end the relationship.
i believe that if you wonder if you are in love, you are not in love.
i will be going to the first event.
you should spend more time with your wife.
love is sometimes considered as the first step to having sex, but there is also pure love without sex.
i recommend that you not do it regardless of what she says.
you should stab at something in close proximity and then move in.
if you have seven setbacks in life then get up eight times.
so called good girls who want to try and live on the wild side for excitement are attracted to bad boys.
this is a normal reaction; even some women find sexy girls to be attractive.
it occurs only on days that end in the letter "y."
apparently this person wants to have a family with me.
do you get anxious if you don't see this person even for a short time?
that is not a good idea at any time.
he would find it unusual but that does not mean it would not have a positive outcome.
what type of party did you have?  do you know if he even likes parties?
i think she is trying to indicate that she is ready for physical contact.
every man has a different preference in woman; some like the ginger type while others prefer the marry ann type.
i would not ask him where is is going.  he probably needs some space to thinks things over and questioning his need for this space will only harm the relationship more.
you will only get hurt in the end.
it is up to you, but if i had to do it over again, i would not.
i assume that you are trying to see if he would cheat on you.
i just do not think there is hope.
perhaps intimacy over the phone with each other.
for example, if you are a shy male, it may be difficult to ask for a date.
you should inform her about how important she is to you.
my family was accepting of it, but i know there are some families that do not accept it.
yes, i have and i benefited from it. i found a superior person that has more affection for me.
whatever happens, do the best that you can do.
otherwise, i agree with you entirely.
try one with a special room, the empty side, or the outside.
i'm not being gross, do you understand what i'm indicating?
if it's warm enough, find a lake that rents paddleboats for a rate of 5 dollars per hour.
why do i want him back?
so my advice to you is: get out there, have fun, mingle, discover new things, be authentic, and laugh.
if he loves you, then he'll wait for you.
that he's not ready for you, and you shouldn't be preoccupied with him.
he's transgender, and has since transitioned. he wouldn't be a good match for you.
if he's your boyfriend, then you should break up with your partner. else, you should forget about it and move on.
i gave him a nice card for christmas.
think about the situation. a man does all of this for you, but you are still not happy?
if you love jesus christ first, he will bless you.
i am going to a place with a pool table.
you have never even seen a picture of her.
i just checked, and they have versions of the song.
health or sickness; rich or poor; better or worse.
just wait. you know the saying goes: "boys only want one thing."
if he is nice, then maybe things will work out this time!
no, it's not bad at all.
hello mate, your problem is the same as mine.
only you can answer that question, but it is not legal in some places.
he also says it bothers him when guys leave me comments.
i'm a young teen and i definitely do like girls that speak their mind.
no, it is not bad at all.
hello, friend, you and i have the same problem.
only you can answer that question, but it is not legal in some places.
he says it bothers him, too, that men leave me comments.
well, i'm a young teen and i definitely do like girls that speak their mind.
when you are 'in love' with someone it happens.
what is they wanted to wait until they got married?
my mother always said that actions speak louder than words.
if you are wondering whether it is love then it isn't as yet.
my girlfriend used to get jealous quite often.
if you don't want a child, you must use a condom.
i believe you should answer that question.
say something different, similar to, "hello. i am joseph blow. nice to meet you.".
it helps sometimes, if you picture yourself telling them, that you love them.
if you recall, her ex boyfriend was not a good man. he cheated on her.
you should inquire whether he likes men.
as far as i'm concerned, if a guy is shy about showing interest in a girl sending her a note would be a good way to start.
my boyfriend engages in many activities of which i do not approve.
you should tell then to let you know.
if she believes that he is mature then she will admit to being fond of him.
there is one man i like in a romantic way, i have yet to speak to him.
males think on sexual things at all times.
this is the cause behind the divorce rate being so high.
greetings, would you like to be my male romantic partner?
love does not cost anything, and those things that do cost can not be true love.
i am interested in one man, but i never engage him in conversation.
all men think about sex constantly.
this is the reason why the divorce rate is so high.
pardon me, but would you like to be my boyfriend?
love is always free, and that which is not free cannot be true love.
did he behave like this before you married him?
what will you do now with your free time?
it is dependent both on the weather and were you live.
when someone loves you, they watch out for you.
if you have been spending time with a man for over a month.
any information that you can find would be much appreciated.
does it matter if she loves you as well?
regardless of what happens, she is too special for you to part ways.
is it possible to have a free, or mostly free wedding, without having to do a television show?
if you are in love, your life is going to be difficult.
do you intend to keep the promise you made?
please speak to that person's best friend.
and it is not this man.
would you love that person regardless of whether or not that happened?
i don't want to be noisy.
but it was oh so much fun getting there.
when you talk about other girls, she gets mad.
i do not want to pry.
but getting there was fun.
it is is my room, so i can watch.
she becomes angry when you talk about other girls.
because it's a huge deal for me.
once you guys get on the topic ask her if you might have a chance.
because they enjoy having sex with someone new.
it cuts in both directions i believe.
when you are not a fan of something do you call it gay?
be courted by an alternatively selected individual while neglecting to inform any individuals.
(abbreviated response ... inquire from him directly as to his areas of enjoyment!)
i have knowledge that my male significant other exhibits a feeling of caring towards me.
i have the knowledge that the reference reads correctly as the pleasant elderly united states of america.
you males enjoy being flirtatious with one another (for instance, tickling sessions, mock fighting matches, pursuing one another) (7)
when you are unattractive, what is there to risk?
why do people not fancy african girls?
you need to learn more about the situation.
i completely sympathize with you.
men do not mess around like women.
however, he is a man with three children and married.
it is difficult, however that will cause you to sleep up and he will be aware of the deceit.
i am a female, but  i do not understand it.
is it a good thing to remain a virgin, if a male, until marriage.
tell him that you two can be friends, with the possibility of something happening later.
that will likely take all of the stress off of you.
the best place to find a date would be college. the best place to take someone on a date is definitely not a club.
simply examine the size of his testicles. clearly state to him that they are looking smaller and watch his response.
if you have a sense of style and hygiene, you will attract a guy.
you need to question her frequently about what she feels for you.
show her, or tell her how much you love her.
if he truly loves you. he'll change his ways.
that's' what i see. i'm an average man.
i agree with them. mother nature gives her the role of feeding and protecting.
if you are not willing to do it, someone should be.
what is the best way i can communicate that i am concerned for her feelings?
men do not like to be with a weak woman.
it is possible you have too many trixies in your life.
i know many men who are attracted to slender women; i think that it's just personal taste.
they can do so but it does not appear to be likely.
i suggest that you don't think of it as spying.
he was constantly on my mind at all times.
if you are looking for a life partner, then it matters.
he spends less time with you because you always have an excuse.
i'm thrilled to be standing atop a 100 foot crane over a gravel pit during a storm!
if they agree or say maybe, then ask her to do something.
would anyone happen to know how i can ask my friend to stop stalking people he falls in love with?
it is clear to see that if you are cheating on him, then you do not truly love him.
now that i look back on it, i do admit it does seem stupid.
someone who is not a complainer or conceited.
go out to the club and ask some girls.
she could have a great mind, but if she resembles a monkey, then it just will not work out.
absolutely not, does he have a brother?
it will not work if you want a partner who eats panipuri.
it may be old fashioned, but it is romantic.
now you have seen his true personality.
he knows how to use words to sexually manipulate people.
i hope i was of assistance to you.
i assume that there is a reason you would take your wife.
i suggest you ask him if he wants to be your boyfriend.
i don't believe it has anything to do with you being a libra while i'm a sagitarius and i do have a problem.
since it will be her ring, it should be something that she likes.
if he wants to make the effort, he will understand what you are trying to accomplish.
but never push, worry, and distress.
i do not care if they are popular.
that may not be the best choice, though.
no, you'd have been a jerk had you said yes!
if you're interested in it, go ahead.
opening doors is charming, but that can't run low.
you don't have to have friends to get a girl.
because your getting older and they ant you to be content.
girl, i've already been there and done that.
surprise him when he arrives home and smell the area.
it would mean he is really unfriendly.
butterflies in the stomach, do you know what i mean?
if you want my honest opinion, absolutely not.
if you do not want to be together forever, then yes.
it depends; however, it would have to be a serious matter.
if you obtain some as well, which does not indicate your sanity is in question, you will understand why she acts as she does.
it will occur when you tell her you love her and are certain she loves you.
be quiet and extract yourself from this situation.
i recommend that you wait until you are at least 30 years of age.
the simple solution is to approach her.
being a "jerk" is one quality, out of multiple, that men possess.
one thing i have learned from my experiences is to allow for life events to happen.
yes, the subject at matter is deemed sinful and considered illegal.

please feel free to ask question. please avoid mentioning religion, sex, or politics.
it is hard to maintain a false facade.
every one finds you attractive.
here is an age old male secret.
if you want to know something don't talk about it just ask.
your children should always be first no matter what age.
let the guy chase the girl.
whenever i feel like showing love, i kiss her.
are they driving you crazy not wanting sex?
people change girlfriends every week.
good question. now i know what to tell my girlfriend i want.
has he ever had his hair cut short?  maybe when your first met him?
what else can i do, i feel that i have tried everything!
i hate diseases because i don't like to see babies suffer.
are you talking about the guys that your previously dated?
you should always put your feelings first, and his should be second.
it honestly depends on the particular girl.
they couldn't wait until they were all grown up.
you are already determined to see the faults and downfalls in people.
i am not even certain whether she would like me to ask her out or not.
that is the kind of thing that gets other good things started.
i feel like this street may only be one way.
may i ask her the details of this proposal?
sometimes certain models like men who are average because they are down to earth with them.
please just relax and take your time, you will find that you have a better time.
you must be patient, someday you will find someone that loves you for who you are.
i'm almost certain he is hiding something that he doesn't want you to know.
you should definitely take her to small claims court.
he said he was returning to his home state whether or not i agreed to go with him.
just joking, but maybe you should hold your breath when you perform oral sex so you don't suffocate.
have you ever tried talking to one to see if there was mutual attraction?
just say what you mean and stop assuming people get the hint.
this guy could be a fake.
a friends mother gave herthis advice- be careful who you date because you just might fall in love with them.
the big question that i have is: do you work as well?
although you know that means giving up your own; no matter how bad and long you hurt.
when she is around you she does things you don't like, maybe you shouldn't be friends with her.
which are you referring to, a friend or your wife and her feelings?
other do not see things as you do, so they don't understand.
i don't think so, i don't trust and i don't sleep!
maybe because, there is no one there with them to tell them not to.
is he more friendly and affectionate with you, or is he just that way with everyone?
what do you speculate her problem to be?
and honestly, why wouldn't a man desire a beautiful, young woman?
i met a girl on the phone, we become very good friends.
afterwards, i purchased a loaf oa bread.
i mean, i am a man, and i am not judging. what would happen if you asked them the question?
all joking aside... there is no reason not to meet him, unless he is not who he says he is.
you might find out later, that you lost the perfect one.
nice guys don't like nice girls.
the same things that not attractive women like.
i am 51 years old which make it hard, but i have to do it.
in my opinion it will happen if it is meant to be.
it is, and it is not a turn off if you have children.
if they are in love and there are no objections then they should.
in other words, she seems interested, so it would be a good time to propose.
quickly lead her to the bedroom.
from the beginning, this has been the case, since we are both employed.
masturbation is acceptable if necessary when remembering.
have casual sex, but do not get committed since you are so young.
attempt asking her what she enjoys.
you should simply proceed with being proud. she is a professional player.  merry christmas.
do you two have a friendship?
do not waste time thinking of your old one.
go around the corner and have your fill of liquor or food. however, as you know, liquor is never good.
then she saw that i did not care, so she went for it.
i just admire the woman's facial beauty and her good looks.
how do i make it special?
did you ever give them a chance?
if you find that guy, you will be happy and it will last.
ensure that you will be able to understand one another.
it may intimidate boys but never men.
my former boyfriend's sister and i were very close at one point.
yes, it does for my girlfriend.
however, once upon the dance floor, they feel intimidated.
take time to let your feelings develop and become clear.
that would be because he has made it clear he is interested in a girl who is very bad, a show off, and prettier than me.
in order to figure out that feeling, give them a little bit.
i would advise forgiving her, getting your man, and moving on.
what happened to prayer in school?
what's funny is i know all of these things, but i do not have a girlfriend.
you have not found the correct one.
first, your children should be your priority.
what do you enjoy?
the exact way you have before!
if he is still unpleasant deep down then it may work but is not worth the risk
i said i would resign my teaching job also.
it relies on who the guy is.
great question but you did not provide information on your charactor.
if deep down in his heart he is cold and unkind, it may work out but it is seldom worth it.
i told you that i would quit my teaching job and go as well.
it all depends on the man.
nice question but you did not tell me of your character.
why not just be friends with him and nothing more?
i have had a lot of trouble with girls in the past, so if you could help me out it would be nice.
he does not love you beyond your body.
never stop smiling because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.
am i going to get hurt?
you can start with a punch line.
there's a generation gap between you two.
why haven't you asked her out?
when they have sexual relations with each other, they are considered lesbian.
the most important thing is not to give up!
in all reality, that would be like dating your mother.
what if the guy turns out to be a jerk?
it seems like he doesn't care. if i were in your shoes, i'd do the same.
how do i start?
my brother, we shall go into the breech, once more.
it is like having your cake and eating it, as well.
i will go with one's answer. vote for one ! vote for one !
however, it is not always true.
after you meet and have known him for some time, then, yes, it is possible to do that.
well, it depends on how much you love her.
i am a decent girl but, i have to admit that bad men definitely can affect you.
shower a woman with all of your attention then, after awhile, ignore her.
i am not able to ask her due to my sheer amount of shyness!
at times i felt as though i was having chest pains!
don't act in a different way just to get attention. simply be yourself.
one way to look at it would be to say that there is no such thing as an ugly woman, just one who is barely pretty.
it is equivalent to why men do not like women to have male friends.
i am a man, and yet i could not answer that with any degree of certainty. what would sexy mean?
one of men's unfavorable characteristics is how they always want to be considered right, even when they are wrong.
are you asking how to get a boy to like you?
i never heard from him again, and then nearly two years later on christmas day, i found out he had passed away.
just wear some clothing that makes you look sexy and turn on the charm.
bring her a red rose, and take her somewhere she likes.
some of them taste better than others.
ask her on a date and take that risk, young man.
if you really love her that much, then ask her to marry you forever.
i have many men friends that i hang out with as friends only.
i would say to just go with your heart, and that is the best i can do.
dude, take the risk and ask her out.
if you really love her that much, maybe you should ask her to marry you.
i have plenty of male friends and we hang out.
i am watching dead fish ollec the fish slayer
i would say, go flow with your heart. that is my best advice right now.
i can say beyond any doubt that i am emotionally ready.
i find my boyfriend's jealousy humorous.
my girlfriend and i have been together five and a half years.
he is not being fully forthcoming with you.
i wish things would change.
i need to get to know someone in order to have feelings for them.
it is impossible to know, so you should just take the risk as long as you want to.
i have a similar situation. i have been dating a man for two weeks.
one option would be to use yahoo search and type in his yahoo name and look for him.
take a deep breath once in awhile.
i don't like it when they act like they don't need to accept the truth.
it looks as though you both are in a difficult position.
you are not my student, but the answer it the same.
i felt the same way before.
it all depends on how the date went.
you now have to equality you desired.
if you need to know, you already do.
go out with friends and talk.
not unless you are together.
i would not do it myself, but is it wrong? in this era, no.
it is because they hate being wrong. that is how my boyfriend is.
if you like someone, you will have to help them with anything they might need.
if she desired you also, then it was wrong.
after many years, you become one with your partner by understanding each other.
so as to not regret anything.
i do not think that six is as common as that.
not if you do not want her to be angry.
support your daughter, no matter her decisions and actions.
do you want to go see if it is friday night?
i guess it comes down to your definition of love.
there is nothing wrong with that as long as he is being treated in an acceptable manner.
friend, if you want certain girls to like you, you need to stop acting stupid around them.
i think you should wait to have sex until both of you are ready.
that is what the majority of men think about.
that would surprise me.
when he hurts be there for him.
smell this ,d you think it stinks?
from the looks of your picture, it would not be difficult.
in the meantime just work on bettering yourself and preparing for what you want.
that would surprise me.
when he is in pain, be by his side.
in your opinion, does she smell bad?
from the appearance of your photograph, it would not be difficult.
in the meantime, work on improving yourself and preparing for what you want.
some guys really dont care.
start seeing other women. that should work for good.
or, is that going to make things hurt more?
he is quite mature, isn't he?
there is no way to break up with a guy and not hurt him.
fine, if you do not want me, let me know and i will bounce, it is not that deep.
make it a bit more universal, like "no fear" or something.
a great name for a punk band!
be yourself with a little bit of spreading, being the best in you.
please instant message me with the correct answer.
ask yourself if you really love him.
can you please tell me where they are as i cannot find them?
i like to wear briefs because i like how they fit.
i do not want to go back to the way things were, but i would like to be friends.
we have three children: a fifteen-year-old and a pair of three-year-old twins.
that remains to be seen. outwardly, i have the attitude of a street punk, but deep down i am a nice person.
i do not know what a surrendered wife is.
all people love to talk about themselves, even those who pretend they do not.
if a gentleman is interested in a female, he should be the first to call her.
you may tell the woman what you would like to tell her.
have love for yourself no matter what you go through. you will admire your hard honest work and accomplishments.
she turned her life around, gave up promiscuity and chose to follow a clean life.
life is short, enjoy yourself while it lasts.
do the best as a simple man.
after that day, you will find out that your relationship with yahoo is over.
be funny, talk about interesting things, and tape twenty dollar bills onto your body.
do not worry whether or not you have a guy.
sadly, you are the fourth person who has asked this question.
am i just too paranoid?
guys can never go wrong with a woman if they give her jewelry.
women can not have it both ways.
they would still think about it for a moment before they say no.
you say that you are young. if that is the case, it is supposed to be like that.
you should start with heavy petting, then move on to cunnilingus.
i suppose that is the first step.
i love when a man wears boxer brief underwear.
that sounds very strange and silly. can you define what you think an online relationship is?
most women would not ask a man on a date.
you can check the yellow pages for more information
i did not mean to make you feel uncomfortable, and i am feeling slightly nervous
immediately after the date or on the day itself
it's not in the immediate mi, clare area.
guys dislike it when they feel that others are nagging at them
no, if you really love someone, then monogamy is your only option.
why would you want three girlfriends?
yes, it is important to discuss that with your physician.
also, please remember that your wife is infallible.
it is like losing a loved one.
send a reply to the email when you can.
let us make a list and disclose everything you want to.
he wants to watch football and have sex at the same time.
i am looking for the entire quote, but for now, i only have this part.
your virginity is very special and, should be saved for someone you really care about.
you should try to go to parties and places where he may be.
there are many women out there that will be interested in you.
you should do it in a church.
sex is not love, it is just lust.
when you are working on a task, take your time, do not rush.
do you mean what you are telling me?
the card that i bought says that you complete the dozen.
some people in relationships take their significant other for granted. they do not appreciate their partner, but would rather them not be with anyone else.
are two dozen roses too many roses to give to someone?
did that make you orgasm?
if i am with him he is okay with my staying at home and not working.
i do not think it will work if he is really a gentleman.
i was offered a position in another state that i am really not intereste din.
do not tell her that you are planning to stay with your wife. she will simply be bitter.
stop and ask her for directions or something else minor in order to start a conversation.
if your family likes your girlfriend and your girlfriend does not care for your family.
her fate has already been determined.
because men are disloyal to women and we know hoe that results.
that is an unfortunate sign, my friend.
you should love everybody the same way you love god.
have her send you a picture first, and then send her your picture.
judging by their response, their answer is most likely "no."
this holds especially when most people are not adept at that skill.
i think if the man is interested we ought to be able to call at least every other day.
what is a major cause of people being disloyal? boredom with their partner.
no one does unless they are psychic or similar.
no, it frightens them but causes them to later become confident, if not arrogant.
if women desired it as much as men we, as a society, would not advance much.
i am never embarrassed or ashamed to be with him.
do not be afraid. the color of her blood is the same as yours.
i do not want any conflict. i only want to get my dress back from you.
he agrees that i am an affable, close friend to him.
if that is so, tell her that reaching climax will not affect that.
that is how it goes, i guess.
i am free to do as i please.
i love this girl very much, but i have no idea how to start!
he sits around a lot playing play station 2.
you know when there is no real way to say something but it is something you know.

make sure she does not read any beauty or celebrity magazines.
does it matter if he is gay?
you should spend more time in sexually explicit positions.
you cannot force someone to harbor affection.
i am having trouble understanding your question. however, it seems you tend to attract younger men.
i find the ring that i am wearing to be sufficient.
i greeted c and asked what c was doing.
i have observed this occurrence on too many occasions so you must leave before the situation escalates beyond control.
i understand, therefore i have enough respect for him to refrain from doing it.
who is concerned with physical appearance as personality is the meaningful attribute.
perhaps another possibility is her possession of intimacy issues, however i suppose we will never know.
it is difficult to find that in these current times therefore it is more difficult to provide for a woman.
could the ones you are attempting to be hoosiers, by chance?
offer small gifts now and then and tell her jokes.
my girlfriend did the same and then left when i told her to find a job.
if you do not already know then you should ask your mother.
examine these facts and then ask yourself if you you are strange or very strange.
that outcome would be perverted, or perhaps reversed.
the result depends on how strongly you beleive in love.
additionally, i've become aware that she does not often return calls.
please proceed to the directory containing all yahoo members.
have you considered using a dating website, such as, yahoo personals, etc.
mostly we forget that and let the birds run away.

you are practically married, just no paperwork.
rather through a note or email. unless she likes it when you ask in person.
she was scared that i would not like it.
single mothers cannot leave the home or are too lazy.
most men are interested in younger women.
what do you have to do?
remember to keep your eyes open and dress well.
either single mothers cannot leave the house, or they are just too lazy to leave the house.
most men prefer younger women!
what do you have to do?
remember to keep a look out and wear something nice.
act as though she does not exist.
they are better than other people, and can get away with it.
no. i think it is a bad idea to sleep with people for whom you have no feelings.
my boyfriend and i have been together for 6 years.
it just about drove my husband crazy.
i would agree with nichole's statement.
they think about how attractive the women appear.
be sure not to take it overly far.
they are both aware and he is always kind however she hates me.
i would like to emphasize that i am offended although i was not the person she said it to.
do not change for the purpose of attracting a man.
in that case, you should call her and suggest that you talk.
women, as well as men, are unfaithful.
if it was not true, the two of you would be simply friends.
this is not a site that directs you to sites that sell pornography.
the waterfall was a great experience but that was all we could hear.
we are not going to sit on our butts.
i was joking about the last choice.
some are pleased with the decision; others not so much.
chivalry is rare now.
if you call him he will want to talk.
what ever needs to be said, say it now.
that would be difficult i believe.
your partner will have total faith in you.
if you get this message please respond when you can.
every woman has a taste even if they are clean, just like a man does.
i never was unfaithful when married.
find out the things she loves and spend time with her.
talk to her beforehand about this.
if you do receive this message could you please respond?
every woman has a type of taste. it does not matter how clean they are.
i never committed adulatory while i was married.
you could find out the things that she likes, and spend time with her.

you should invite him over for a romantic suprise.
a marriage takes work, but can be very satisfying.
you need to socialize more. you will have fun and meet some girls to talk with.
can you give me a call please?
please let me know if you ever find a perfect man.
do not allow your enemy to discourage you.
i wish i could say honesty, but even that can backfire.
but now, she looks sad everyday.
but that is only for extroverted people.
i believe that it should not matter how many men you have been intimate with.
just be patient, and pray to god. ask him who the best husband for you is!
believe me, you deserve so much better.
if you want your man to dress more nicely, buy his clothes you have picked.
she has to want it for herself.
do you remember where you got that nice dress?
i would get him two dozen roses because the more roses you buy him, the more he will love you.
married men tend to be more mature because they have more experience when it comes to handling relationships.
when did you break up, and why were you so jealous?
i'm still trying to find out, so if you find out first, please let me know.
do not let them get too close.
i always thought people were sure they wanted marriage when they got engaged.
i do not want a confrontation, but i am still upset with her after an incident four years ago.
hello, it is good know you care for the girl.
if you find him attractive, try flirting and see how he reacts.
love is a feeling, but feelings are not love.
find a girl you want to go out with, and without thinking about it, ask her out.
you might find out that you have to stick with her the rest of the remaining year.
love to see full big ones, pretty eyes, that are not butch looking.
maybe he has never thought of you in that way.
in ohio where i live, you do not see much chivalry there either.
if you have something in common, it would be wise to use it.
what in the world would she do if her son was to die in real life?
he does, however, always quit or gets fired, from one job to the next.
i am not even sure how he feels about me.
leave your home in pursuit of other interests, as it pleases you.

he want someone to feel sorry for him.
you are the one.
i am blind in one eye.

you will know, because you will get a gut feeling.
most the time when you fall for a great girl, it is just infatuation.
spending time apart from your partner, will help you know if he likes you or not.
he is not interesed in you.
excuse me, kempie. please explain the train analogy
a gentleman has a different mode of thought than a lady. please give him time understand the situation better.
please consider your feelings. do not apply too much thought.
the situation would be far worse if i wasnt familair with the gentleman.
just tell her that you really liked her, and she'll decide from there.
anyways, don't burn your bridges, give them a chance to prove their worth.
the other user did not answer the question correctly.
i know quite a few beautiful girls who don't think they're beautiful.
maybe he has a sister who uses the phone all the time.

on the east side of pittsburgh is beto's pizza, the best pizza!
you do not want everyone in your wedding.
there is so much porn, and you want to pay for it?
if you ever gave this line to a woman, tell me why you did.
what fancies her, what baby girl likes.
on the east side (pittsburgh), we eat at beto's, it is the best pizza you will ever eat.
dude, you do not want most of the people at your wedding to say that i had her.
man, there is so much porn out there, must you pay?
if you ever used this line with a girl, please tell me why.
show her, tell her, and draw her a diagram.
they are the ones who helped you come all the way here.
it matters more than it does for a guy.
she was accidentally bumped into.
he is going to be a young man.
say that you are sorry and ask for forgiveness.
what do you do when you can not think of anything other than spending the rest of your life with her?
if you are not having sex it is because it is her choice.
sometimes you need to play the game if you want to say ahead.
i do not understand, you are supposed to be wrong?  right?
i keep expecting her to return.
forget about him and enjoy the love you have.
one avenue to attempt is a yahoo email search.

oh, leave them alone, people will learn from getting bit. - honda lane
and what it does not work its way out?
i do not mean with war either way.
if you are a woman then it is wonderful to do.
what if you love this person completely?
"you should leave him alone.  people learn by getting bit."  hondo lane.
what if it does not work out?
i do not mean with war, either.
if you are a girl, then it is awesome to do.
what if you like this person?
tell her that you are in love, but not to whom, and then guage her reaction.
which is more important in the grand scheme, a temporary infatuation, or your abiding friendship with her?
that situation would be far from ideal, correct?
women never express displeasure of the fact that i am posession of merely five.
i am non-caucasian, and stand six feet tall at the age of twenty-seven.
try telling her you are in love with her and then follow her reaction.
remember in the long run, is her friendship more important or your crush?
that would not be good, would you not say?
i only have five and women never complain about it.
i am twenty-seven  years old, six feet tall, and not white.
i would grade their performance 100% if i could.
smile and tell them 'great', it's a fool proof plan.

i do not want to be divorced or to live separated from my husband.
love is what make intimacy great!

in either case, you need to let her know.  would it not be bad if she left because she did not know?
i hope you will be caught by asking that question.
i am sure he would love to help!
if you truly think he is cheating, then he most likely is.  good luck.
seven years are enough to understand a lot of things in life.
either case, you have to let her go, it would be bad if she got away because she did not know.
i hope you are caught asking that important question.
i am sure that he would love to help.
if you truly think he is cheating, he may be. i wish you luck
seven years are enough to understand many things in life.
i enjoy hearing information relevant to this.
i was unfaithful twice and will never be again as i consider it the worst mistake in my life.
why would you not attempt to seduce him?
appears as though you should not be engaged.
however, the new child has been in charge since his arrival.
they say that if you love someone, you should liberate them.
i will simply say i will never forget it.
i hope that she misses you as much as you miss her.
i have experienced that myself.
it is likely the same topics that you discussed during your date.
best of luck to you, and hold your head high.
they even propose marriage to me.
you should not remain if you are not in love.

even though i am married now and not looking to be in a relationship anymore. i still laugh at the pick-up lines.
that is awesome, amazing, the best, and so sad, all in one.
i do not think it is 'wrong' at all.
asking girls on dates is not that different.
clearly you like her and know how to tell her your feelings.
is she annoying you wanting intercourse?
if she has intercourse with many men, she is a slut.
when you spend a lot of time with an individual does not mean you are dating.
you think your family happiness is yours.
are you sure is not that you like her and do not know how to let her know?
is she driving you crazy wanting sex?
if she has to sleep with every guy, it is clear she is a slut.
just because you are hanging out with a person does not mean you are dating.
i am enjoying myself, but unfortunately i need to depart now. i am happy. thank you!
simply relax, and continue as usual.
men, for some strange reason, find attraction in puffed out hair, fake fingernails, and spandex clothing that is molded to the body.
i am completely in the dark. if you should find the answer, please write and let me know. i am curious as to the answer too.
people are human, so they may make errors, even though that does not make it right.
also, are you able to manage the way he spends his money?
do not forget that it is for better or for worse!
i am unsure, but i have a very similar issue.
no, she is your wife. furthermore, she would be aware!
if you plan on creating children, they require a lot of care. such as, prenatal care, baby furniture, for example a stroller, clothes, food, and more.

no , she is your wife and should know that.
if you plan on children, they will need so much : prenatal care, baby furniture/stroller clothes, food, etc

is there a possibility that the two of you may consummate your relationship?
it behooves you to give her everything she asks for and more.
my apologies for making you feel uncomfortable.  may we continue on?
it would not be good if the two of you no longer wish to be in each other's company.

if it is possible or worth trying is up to you.
you will never know if he likes you unless you ask.
it is as easy as reading your letter.
it would be wrong to ask him to break up with a girl that he just started dating.
give him a smile or do something which makes her laugh at you.

the first time i thought he was nice and sweet.

i love cat's answer, it is perfect.
please think of your children, no child deserves to abused.
men learn that they can do whatever they want, and they can lie, and a woman will still let it go.

it's perfect because i actually like cats.

i am currently married, soon to be divorced, but will consider myself single as of new year's eve.

get her to eventually ask him to her place.
get her close to coming, and when she asks you to stop, do so.
hope you can understand me, it is up to you, please think about it.
see if he finally gets the message.
all the states have good looking women, but many are too stupid to see it.
dictate to her to eventually as him to accompany her to her own residence, or something similar to this.
excite her until she may have an orgasm and when when she tells you to stop, then you should stop and step away.
i hope you can understand me. everything is up to your decisions, please take some time to think about it.
investigate if he finally understood your actions.
every state has many attractive girls and women, however many people misunderstand this statement!
i hope he is nice. it is the inside that counts rather than your looks.

it is disappointing, but they can get away with it most of the time.
they cannot really wake up until they do something really out of hand.
if it does not work, it makes it much easier to get over her.

you should be dating a lot of people not just her your just in high school
if you really want it make sure
peep her out and relax
go out find a good girl one that want poop on you
you need to be sincere and just get over it
it is usual for the other individual to have acquired an item which you have not.
they have engaged in coitus outside the relationship. either the partner is not troubled by it, or has engaged in a similair activity.
the item is non-existant.
persons who cheat are usual deceptive as well. they will likely profess ignorance while being aware of the issue.
please provide information on orgasms, so that i may climax at any opportune moment.
azo pills will make your urine orange.
it is good to see you are up to date, david.
from what i remember, i believe it was the second and the third.
because you have dated less than 100 people, he still considers you to be a novice.
do you love him for the person inside of him?
it is worth looking for but is hard to find.
are you dating younger men just so you can play around, but they are getting too serious?
but, it is not a thing to be very concerned about when you think about it.
no more than twelve and no less than five.
it's worth looking into it if it
if you can get over that, then you are straight.
let me know if it works.
did you tell him? you were really serious then.
it is because you want to get back together with him.
you could just email me the money.  i could give you my email address if you want it.
if you can get over that, you are strong.
please let me know if it works well.
are you really serious?
just because you want to get back with him as his girlfriend, you would do that?
you could just email the money through paypal. would you like my address?
if you do not like it, just move on to the next category.
i am afraid that she might get angry or that she well not like me.
do not pull away too quickly. you know he likes you if he pulls you back in.
it depends on who it is and how the date went.
i have noticed that i get annoyed with men who, for reasons i don't know, want to have sexual relations.
love seems more sweet in the beginning of a relationship.
i would love a card that offered me a free back scratch, massage, or free kiss.
i feel that this situation is not good at all.
look around and you should be able to find what you are looking for.
if your family is similar to my family, what you are telling me may be true.
what do you suggest i do for her?
take things day by day, as love may frighten him.
keep dating until you find the right person for you.
do not ruin a good friendship.
i do not think that is romantic at all, but i do think flatulence is comical.
what is that person di not like you because you had short hair, etc?
this will be an investment for your future.
you just think of all the ups and downs of the situation.
showing your love is about all the little things you do for someone you love.
you should not judge people because what if someone did not like you because your hair was short?
if you continue to do this, it will pay off for your financial future.
if someone says koigokoro temae, that is chinese for i love you.
make sure you think about all the positives and negatives.
part of caring about someone is showing your love for them.
he manipulating you to make you feel that you are indebted to him.
you should simply enjoy living your life and love others.
the situation is not ideal.
if you are attracted to a person, then why not?
ask yourself if she is worth waiting for, and are you willing to wait?
shart checking out the other guys and let him know how it feels.
you shoudl not have had an affair. the damage is already done.
if the relationship is only sexual you should be sure to use protection.
some people know the possibility of divorce even when they are getting married.
you should not let him know that you are thinking about leaving him.
he always buys me whatever i want, but he does not want anything from me.
you should first make sure that she is available.
i think women see things differently than we men do.
simply walk up and ask him if he would like to go out with you.
that would be britney spears behind, or carmen electra's mouth.
i would have instantly said yes if i'd had the choice.
however, if she is just being polite, and is not actually interested in you.
i am acquainted with a man who met his wife in the same manner.
i have been unfaithful and had others be unfaithful to me.
direct your attention to this statement that men expel and women retain.
in the event of another man arriving at your home to take her, would you not be slightly envious?
they could possibly be sexual addicts.
it impresses me when a man does not try to hard.
she has to date a lot more guys to find one that she really likes.
honestly, it is not a big deal.
if there is hate around, it is easily noticeable.
i asked you how many drinks?
as for me, it is a feeling i can never put into words.
it is so intense not to notice; you will certianly know if it happens.
if he looks at other women when you are not around then, it is alright.
unless, perhaps, you do not mind other men having intercourse with your woman.
it depends on if he really cares for you or not.
do you have a good figure or are you extremley beautiful
cool chick with hot ass is what i like
if you find a good girl you wont want to marry some one else
my feelings are you are more lonely than in love
if he gave you something what would happen
i would like to be with the brunette.
if you would like to have an american girlfriend, you should go to the united states.
i would say no since you even asked that question.
that is because they are simply bored, with nothing better to do.
if you are unsure but thinking of asking someone, then just go ahead and do it.
if he stalks you, call the police.
you have to marry him to know what kind of husband he will be. family life changes everybody. merry christmas!
many women and men prefer an uncut guy.
you have to enter his full name.
why would you want to see her toes?
i think you should be forward and ask him.
this is the first time that i have heard of this.
you have no legal recourse.
i love him; however, he is married and i need assistance in ending our relationship and dealing with a feeling of depression.
everyone has an unconventional side.
i believe the majority of women are high maintenance and difficult to deal with.
i do not believe you will be able to live up to a life-long commitment.
please stop pestering him and give him a beer to drink.
you may want to pay attention to her.
good luck finding the right answer for it!
they are insecure men and cannot handle a real woman.
just do not over do it and go straight to the next woman if she says no.
just look to her eyes.
good luck in finding the right answer!
they are insecure dweebs who cannot handle a real woman.
if she turns you down, take some time and do not go on to the next girl.
just look into her eyes :)
it is in the people search section.
yes it indeed does, to a certain extent.
she refused you one already; i assume that intels that you two were not truly together?
is she or the man you are infatuated with more important to you?
i only speak of this from experience!
if you trust him, meet his family and hope for the best.
she expects a boy to do the things about which she is thinking- do you understand?
you missed him or her when he or she was gone.
secondly, he might respect you, unlike most men, and not want to cause problems with you.
gentlemen are sometimes too attainable.
you should be unfaithful while she is being unfaithful.
he is trying to find an opportunity to be unfaithful.
i do not think that it is wrong.
i did not realize i am so sick.
you should show her what a nice and caring guy you are.
i like to french kiss and make out.
if you can prove that they have it, you should take them to small claims court.
the answer is no, there is no chance with him.
aside from a tree, some men would probably like some polo boots for the wonder. it really depends on the age.
they have kept a friendship since her divorce.
did you try to turn around?
to ask a girl out that you like, do not sweat it and practice it in the mirror.
these kind of women usually end up with a man who does not accept drama.
give your friend the space to follow their own desires.
in addition, it feels more painful when the other person does not seem to be bothered by the break up.
yes. if you ask nicely, you may get something even more from him.
i would suggest you ask them. i have not heard anything.
what is she is realy mean or crazy?
go to the arcade, go cart riding, bowling, or play pool.
perhaps she is thinking the same thing, about how to tell if he still loves me.
anywhere, i prefer somewhere nice.
i say no, because if he has done that to you once, it will probably happen again.
you will always come back to him.
or, you could just talk to him.
if she likes you she will uunderstand.
it might be that your wife only had cybersex, but that is still sex.
i need one for a guy i like.
the whole saying about guys mature a few years.
so flirt with one of them and you will be in love.
a gravitational force which pulls you.
girls never go for sensitive guys.
i would take her with me, then go hang at the mall, but i like rich's answer best.
if you have an unresolved issue, write a formal compalint and forward it to the appropriate group of people.
i would not exhibit that behavior in front of all individuals.
it is unclear why unmarried individuals with no intention of marriage engage in casual sex.
after celebrating christmas for five years, my husband gifted me a leather jacket.
if you still have trouble, file a complaint and reverse to them.
i would not do that to just anyone.
why do so many people have sex with people they have no intention of marrying?
my husband received a leather jacket for our fifth christmas.
just have an affair with a married man.
why are you looking for free? do you have some money problem?
and finally, ask him why--what does she mean to him? will it happen again?
no, she might reject you because she will think you want a relationship with her and her mom.
or if you meet her at home, she will need to look for a vase to put it in.
i just will not waste my time.
why are you looking for free things, are you having money issues?
ask him what she means to him or will it happen again.
she may break up with you because she may not trust you with her and her mother.
if you meeet her at home she may need a vase.
i will not waste my time.
you could just stay back and see how she handles it.
he is definitley a lowlife who sucks.
does the penis size really matter?
actually i know more women them men sexually.
most of the guys that like big girls are really skinny.
this is tough because you said you are still in love with him, how long were you two together?
you can ignore the ones who said "alcohol."
you never know your luck, there could be a big percentage or a little one, good luck.
they only want one thing and it is not the responsibility of a family.
it would be foolish to believe that he would prefer to wait until marriage when that is clearly not the case.
it would best if you avoided places he frequents.
if you are confused about your sexuality, and you think you might be a homosexual male, then you will enjoy sleeping with men.
it is a pleasure to answer these questions!
are you certain that you love him for who he is at this time?
it's the same as some women do, while some women do not.
i'm not putting anyone's ideas down. i am simply trying to think constructively.
preferences for a woman include: long hair, nice legs and behind, and small breasts.
as i stated, allowing time would be the best advice.
he will not care.
you have my confidence, i wish you much luck.
how do i do this?
i am a woman, and i am not a woman.
men are men and they tend to jump from one topic to another.
i wish you the best of luck, i am confident in you.
watch over the whole situation carefully.
i wonder how will i take care of this situation?
i am a girl, and personally i am not.
guys usually just switch from one topic to another fairly fast.
i had sex on the internet with a random guy.
also remember flowers. flowers are a must.
i was really scared of one guy who was creepy.
another option would be to use the personal ads on yahoo. i am also looking for a part time lover.
however they are lacking in commitment, such as wanting marriage or children with you.
it is just having fun and pleasing one another.
first off, ask him if he is.
you will just know if you like someone.
i like redheads with a fine, sexy body.
if she does not set this guy straight, then maybe you should say something to her.
i really have feelings for this girl, but i am too shy to let her know.
most girls do that because they have a strong feelings for them and you might want to impress them.
just remember, a life-long commitment is just as it implies.
i really like this woman, but i am too shy to speak to her.
most women do becasue they have a crush, and you want to impress them.
just remember a life long commitment is just that, life long.
can you head it off at that pass or not?
give her a link like a blog site yahoo 360 or myspaces.
i agree with catnip. my mother never cares about any of my boyfriends business.
the smaller something is, and the lower your self confidence, the worse your performance will be.
wake up and smell the coffee.
go out with friends, not necessarily males but females.
you are too high class to ask such a thing- keep your personality high and do not do it.
you could always point out people you see kissing.
family in general division. no thank you.
follow along with whatever the best you have had would think.
in addition, he did not push for sex.
we have been together for 26 days, and i am hoping to have more days together.
i would say "good, keep looking."
how can i get her to love me?
just do not go overboard with it.
just the fact that you even put yourself in the position to watch her makes you a cheater.
if he likes older women, he probably likes mature women.
please be sure to listen with your ears.
whether or not they are attractive or not.
if he is jealous, he may not trust you and neither would i.
i began to date at the age of 14.
actually, my girlfriend does it on occasion.
i have never actually used them, however my relationship is so exceptional it can not improve.
she may be a friend, family or a person you are already aware of.
when did i cease to do that?
men hunt while women care for a nest.
my friends and family give me a hard time about the same issue.
please let me know once you find out.
let them know that you like them.
remember that any man can sweep a lady off of her feet; he just needs the correct broom.
what personality attributes do you ladies look for in a man?
it will not work out. if he cheated on you once, he is sure to do so again.
it is because she does not think anyone would like to meet her in person.
** the first half of this sentence this is not in english!
spend time with friends or alone, but not cheating.
sorry to say it, but you still act like a child.
going out. do you still say that expression these days? please, do me a favor. do not act so desperate.
on that day, did he at least spend time with you?
hello, do you have a little (insert ethnicity or race) in you?
it is the the same reason that men do.
of course that is a good idea. do not be too extravagant though. something under twenty dollars should be fine.
that may introduce many more problems.
excuse me, i find you very attractive.
i hope you receive a kick with adequate force to dislocate your jaw. i wish you good luck!
gentlemen are strange in that they are simutaneously simple and complex. i believe every man engages in this activity atleast once.
i have surgically altered neither my breasts or my eyes.
usually the way that you acquire a girlfriend is the same way that you will lose them.
the fact that i want her back is not going away.
i agree but only if he invites you to go along with the friends.
soldier, is she in love with you?
i witnessed it myself.
most people these days look only at the physical stuff.
women can be as equally as guilty as men.
that way, she can get whatever she wants.
he said that if i died, he would kill himself. i humored him and said, ok.
look for signs that she likes you.
other people are drawn to that, and you will have more friends then you ever dreamed.
only they are marture enough, though.
smile, peck him, and give him a big hug.
get a big piece of paper and write 'i love you."
most girls only look for the waller, and they are idiots for doing so.
that is the only solution to your problem until you are capable of moving on.
as a matter of fact, i would not go on a date with him.
perhaps you both could have a very strong relationship.
do not bother another woman's partner.
goodness, i became very tired writing that last sentence.
you can have one without the other one.
this your best friend and lover, and the one with whom you dream of growing old.
she is eighteen years old and big and girly.
from parenting q & a: question. is it acceptable to discuss sex with my twelve year old ?
these past two weeks me and my best friend weren't as together as we used to be.
if you have been dating a short time, she might not be interested in you anymore.
if they are the one, you will know it.
it is not the end of the world if it goes wrong.
break it to her gently that you do not wish her to be in your wedding.
ok then; do you have a job?
knowing you, i think you can devote yourself to one person.
i heard raz b say that to sister to sister magazine.
i am so confused , please answer my questions.
do not be afraid, you might get invited and have a blast.
for several reasons, are you liek every other man that does nothing but normal things?
i heard raz b said that to "sister to sister" magazine.
i am very confused. please help me resolve this.
do not be frightened, you may be invited and enjoy yourself.
there are several reasons for this. are you similar to every other man, doing nothing but eating, sleeping, defecating and watching television?
i can confirm that it does work from personal experience.
personally speaking, i enjoy art.
durex is a condom that will not break, regardless of its use.
i recommend always jewelry, although chance by channel is also good.
as a last resort, you could try a more risque christmas gift.
you may kiss him.
families are established in this way. i hope the two of you are happy.
you need to get over this issue.
the basis for a strong friendship between men is mutual trust
if you book a cruise late, you can often find cheap rates.
truly, give it to the salvation army
if he doesn't relish it, simply ask him to end it.
hence, they must come to a conclusion as to who has the nicer behind.
no, i believe that was grape vine talk and not an actual fact.
at the moment i feel deeply from the first glance
as a rule, it is better to proceed forward than to reverse.
am i mistaken, or do you receive a a great deal of that?
what do ladies prefer in a gentleman's physique?
i am anticipating the statement.
please wait until you have fully prepared yourself if you are not currently prepared.
please be polite, currently lots of people forget to be polite.
buddy, so long as you are quiet, and they are sound asleep, just go about it !
have you ever had a girlfriend you don't like, and teased and made fun of, and she suddenly become crazy about you ?
it is worth waiting for true love. he says that he is making an effort, so give him a chance.
but loving with eyes shut.
it is advisable to get tested with one's future spouse before marrying one another.
there is no way to keep a woman in a relationship if she no longer wants to be there.
this is because men make this sort of decision without fully thinking it through.
true love is not painful or harmful to the people in the relationship.
there are also significant cultural and religious differences involved.
why did god set my mind when i cannot get him.
well, it depends, especially for me.
i say this because once you cheat, you cannot stop.
the more she treats me like poop, the better.
men see that as criticism, even though you so do not mean for it to be!
i like a girl that's in two of my classes.
he wanted to use it to kill her.
i don't care if you kissed her.
we played that game as kids.
always trust your gut feeling.
i like this girl i only have two classes with her.
he told me he tried to kill her with that.
who cares if you kissed someone?
when we were kids we played that game.
your gut feeling is usually correct.
that does not apply to all guys, but most of them.
please specify if it is a girlfriend, wife, stranger, friend, etc.
i think you must give more time for your relationship.
i went crazy and bought my boyfriend all kinds of things for our first christmas.
i think either is fine with me; but i prefer bad guys.
in my opinion you are taking a chance either way.
if he says "yes", then you know it is over.
after how many hours would you say sex is too long?
would you consider yourself a homosexual?
be very genuine with the recommendation given to you.
if she does not break up with him...
usually during the first date, the guy tries to impress you and somethign goes terribly wrong.
you just do not know about it.
could it be that she is shy? why not give it another chance and talk to her again?
some men are sexier without hair.
when he gets along with his girlfriend.
you ought to ask a friend to do it.
i could discuss this forever, but in the end the answer is definitely no !
no, men just think that this is how women answer questions.
when i was eighteen i had a great relationship with a thirty seven year old.
try to know details about her.
if love is respectful and mutual, it is a beautiful thing.
you are fifteen and that is too old for spanking in my opinion.
they want to impress them.
do not give her too much space, or it will turn up bad.
do you have any details about her?
it's a wonderful thing, provided it is respectful and mutual.
i think 15 is a bit too old for spanking.
because they think it's impressive.
since he responded by saying no, he lacks instincts of women.
there is a saying- "you never forget your first love."
we did not succeed.
therefore i said that we should just remain friends.
explain to him that you did not mean to appear forward, but just wanted to say hello.
did she give you something?
explain to me men's reasons for doing that.
it would seem that men get found out more often.
however, it is a unique thought.
i must inform you that calla lillies are very good and are available in a myriad of colors.
did she give you anything?
tell me why men do that?
i guess men just get caught doing that more.
it is a unique thought.
calla lillies are so beautiful and come in many colors.
porn is a creative activity- writing, picture, films, etc.
we are just waiting for the catch.
i have the same problem!
he has been a disrespectful bastard that likes to get smacked in the face.
i feel you need to move on and still remember your kid.
you should not have premarital sex if it is against your religious beliefs.
yes. make it a coupon for oral sex, or something similar.
love happens sometimes when you weren't thinking about it.
if not, there are plenty of other people to choose from to have a relationship with.
preferably someone who is not afraid to show emotion.
i doubt the relationships last long with a bad boy image that some girls like.
i am not that kind of guy and i think that guys are cowards.
you are too young to date or be in love.
they might be feeling the same way and want more as well.
i hope you find the right one.
dress really sexy before he goes out, so that he can not go out with the boys.
how does this make you feel?
it had been 37 years now and well, whatever.
it seems hard if she fell in love.
you are not engaged yet, so there is no reason to worry as of yet.
it is wrong to cheat.
there are two ways of cheating in modern day.
try to get a girl then take her picture.
if you want to have sex with him too, then talk to him all you want.
if you want extravagant, then it will cost $20,000.
i would ask the people you care about whether or not they felt cheated on.
if you are meant to be together reducing your stress will help to get her.
i send my best wishes and please forgive me; my comments were not meant to hurt the lay person.
i believe that all males only need physical love.
in my opinion, he is not a man if he waits until you are married.
should i consider getting married in another location?
if you do not wish to be cheated on, you want to make sure you don't cheat yourself.
someone recommended that i do it myself and that it should only take three seconds.
if you try to kiss her and she does not pull away, she wants you to kiss her.
the probability of cheating increases if the person owns a cellular telephone.
that would depend on how tight it is.
what amount you spend depends on other things.
now everyone is happy except him.
i would say, is it in yet?
would you not have what is considered grounds for a divorce?
is it that you want to be the female version of 'the one?'
wait untill you get to know him better before you tell him about the kids.
just do not get them mad by getting them drunk.
is there a heart to listen to or is it just teenage puppy love.
if someone did it to you and you did not like it, then why ruin someone elses marraige?
my former girlfriend and her sister are very beautiful women.
i recommend that you purchase a bass boat instead so that you can fish next summer.
use any technique you have to get him to ask the other woman to leave.
if his behavior does not change, i recommend that you call the police.
when i date a guy i like to kiss and then i am open to going further with him.
it takes two people to love.
be careful not to be caught by security.
ask him to choose between you and her.
i think he likes me because he flirts with me and holds my hand.
you should try dating.  and remember that it is always better to take it slow and be on your best behavior.
in the end both of you will be happy.
do you want your family and friends to attend?
whether or not you are with this young lady, he is going to be upset.
don't fear the unknown.  give it your best shot!
not only is he poor but he also displays a bad attitude in life.
in addition, you married him, and you were the one who proposed.
i call her baby or hunni. she calls me: pooh bear, boo boo, her slave, etc.
if you love her, then i would advise you go for it.
try making an advance. if she does not resist, then you have consent.
you need to stop and really think about if you truly love him.
if that is not an option, there are other sources available.
it relys on what he is lieing about.
that would depend on what you are talking about; days, years, do you love her; if yes, then, why not?
let her know that you think about her.
i have found a woman that i love; i love her for who she is.
it is a small gesture but it means a lot!
what are some things i can do to get revenge against her?
love is just something that everyone does. we get stuck falling in love.
i have a good time when i am dating him, but i quickly become bored with the relationship.
don't try to end the relationship too quickly, but if you do and he keeps pursuing you, then you know that he cares about you!
first of all, do not marry him.
she said he is just a friend and even refers to him as her "homeboy".
they do not need an extra reason to kiss, haha! happy holidays!
ask yourself: would you want another guy to try to take your girlfriend away from you?
she did not cherish your love as you cherished hers.
is it to make love with somebody?
i am pretty sure they would not do that for you, due to all the pain you would be in.
they prefer them with back hair instead.
if you are ok with women liberation, girl power, and stuff like that, then yes.
your girlfriend has not accepted no.
my boyfriend wanted to have a baby and be married but changed his mind. it is too late.
maybe he thinks you can get back together one day.
it probably will not for you if religion is a major factor in one of your lives.
i think you mean relationships for women that are sexual, with their significant others.
your girlfriend did not accept it.
my boyfriend wanted to get married and have children, but he changed his mind, it is too late now.
maybe he think that the two of you can get back together.
it probably is for you if religion is very important to one of you.
i think you mean a relationship with girls with love or sex from their partner.
i have many women calling my home all day, every day.  i ask them not to call to dissuade them from continuing.
that does not seem to be advantageous if you plan to have children.
listing them all would result in a very long list.
sometimes that is not always the case. and you are the best judge.
dear katherine, please be careful when dealing with this person.
i think men and women cheat for various reasons.
if you are not married and really mean it, why not say it?
your questions do not make any sence.
go to the courthouse and ask for the paperwork. usually it is about 200 dollars.
do exactly what your heart is telling you.
if you did not have intercourse with him
be brave and talk to her.
men do not care about birthdays in the same way women do.
if he is already in love with someone else, do not pursue him.  instead, search for another man.
a woman will stay with a man, no matter what anyone says, if she loves him.
i want a baby badly also. but why make myself miserable and poor by having one now?
guys rarely take girls back; but girls seem to take guys back.
make me feel happy and free!
i do nto think you ever stopped loving your ex.
it is kind of like a caveman gene.
as long as the two of you are willing to work at keeping it that way.
i think that it is a turn off because i do not like the way it feels on my face.
i have that problem but i try. it helps some.
if you are wondering why lesbians hate you, then you have already answered your own questions.
this does nothing but tempt fate.
i call her my meali'i and she calls me her po'okela.
would you like to go to my apartment, order a pizza, and have sex?
ask yourself: did he have the money?
and if it does not, then be satisfied with being happy.
if you like more thing about them, then go for it.
that is cold, not giving you something for your birthday.
i will create one and give it up.
and just like that, you will have your love back.
if it works out, great; it not, no loss.
is that because they're friends and family?
that depends on what you look like.
most people at my school know i am gay.
did it work, even for just a laugh? why?
i think he finished elementary school with f's in every class!
i feel as though i should do something.
a lot of things to think about if you are looking for life!
i am seventeen and i believe she has been with me since i was eight years old.
it is illegal; the 20 year-old should be put away.
you should try it with the lights on!
conversations among men rarely contain lies.
a majority of men become timid around women.
they are someone that i never connected with.
i hope you find this pleasing and useful. i think it is very sweet.
you deserve someone who sees the potential in you.
show and do not tell her that you can fulfill her needs and wants.
i really couldnt tell you what it was but i know it was fun and feels good.
do not grab her arm or step on her to be rejected.
if your mother thinks its ok, tell someone else- a teacher, nurse at school.
buy her what you want her to have. after all, its the thought that counts.
she will if you are nice to her, do things for her, and treat her with respect.
while standing in front, on the phone with her, of course.
it would make the illegal into something legal.
continue to love and be loved!
my sister and brother keep pestering me, even though i have asked them to stop.
i do not understand how men constantly forget an important date, when women never do.
how should i approach an attractive woman to ask her out?
due to my divorce, i suffered financially. she did not care.
i would not be one to give you advice on that, since i can not do it myself.
he sounds like he enjoys playing mind games to get girls to be crazy about him.
they say it is a mans ego but a woman is a hoe.
no lady wants a weak man, so you can not be a punk about it.
they call only once a week?
i might go to the beach, do something interesting and creative.
again, i can assure you that this tactic will be successful.
unless you are too aggravated to continue the relationship, continue it and confront him about his lack of generosity with gifts.
you should go somewhere that will allow you to simply relax, talk, and enjoy yourself.
don't allow anyone to continually withhold information from you until convenient times.
this option is only worth it if you truly cannot afford to refrain from taking it.
though he was honest, it still sucks.
just be careful because a lot of guys are users.
i do not knowm but you are the one in love, right?
i broke up with this girl and then it broke my heart.
we will kill them with kindness has always had a funny sound to it.
if all you seem to recieve is promises and more promises, you need to be careful!
it is a friend but you can still be inimate, and that is fine.
attempt to listen before speaking, you may miss out on something important.
age does not matter if you love her, it is all about the feelings between you two.
i am attracted to someone who shares my dreams.
it is sometimes possible for kids to be born abnormal.
good luck on your search.
i doubt einstein knows the answer to that question.
be confident about yourself, and do not let another man take away your woman.
of course, men like women asking them out.
if you really love someone, there is nothing wrong in trying to get back together.
thus it would probably be better to do that in his bed.
people are crazy and mean these days.
however, i do enjoy it more when i am with a big guy.
to give a hideous person their first kiss.
if you want to achieve intercourse use your hand.
yes, praying for the best for you, i realize they are terrible anyways.
a nice, cold six pack, and a stellar game on television.
he may want to slow things down, or be a friend with beneficial attributes.
in the end you will all get burned if you do not.
you jsut have to wait on her, she is out there.
is that not great news?
it is like asking why women do not find bald men attractive.
you put the penis in the vagina and thrust.
the same reasons that men cheat on women. personally, i would not know.
my friend is going through that, but she is 16 and adoption is the best.
do not be too nice either. we like guys who are somewhat bad. good luck!
try out a country bar. there are many of them in that area.
does it matter in today's world?
so, she asked for the moon.
that is true, but it does not last long.
it would not be as special if you did not write it yourself.
do not be worried, you will find someone who truly loves you if you keep looking.
you are looking at it in that way.
it is not easy to move on.
it means he is still alive and a man that loves women.
get her something sexy she can use with her husband.
do you even have to ask?
most people love to have christmas gifts.
it is not that easy to move on.
it means that is heterosexual, and alive.
get her something that she can use with her husband.
why do you even have to ask that question?
i think most people like receiving a christmas gift.
you do not want something that reminds you of your dad. that would be kind of creepy.
i believe in love at first sight, but some are just mere infatuation.
if that is what you like and enjoy at the moment, and regret does not come...
forget it and save yourself the embarassment,
he just expressed his love and has every right to. what happenned?
if you are nice i will acquiesce.
i examined the circumstances and wisely decided to leave.
that is not your husband is it?
if she gets angry she wasn't that good of a friend.
repeat that after the third one.
are you sure that you spelled kamasutra correctly, based off your spelling we are going another direction.
male or females applicant accepted.
do you think this feeling is love at first sight?
you will be ready to be in a relationship with a male when, you  can handle the ups and downs that comes with it maturely.
if you were kissing someone else, your heart cheated well before now.
i am in total agreement with the answer above.
or whatever makes you happy.
wow, that was quite an error!

if you believe she is interested in you then i would ask her out on a date.
playing games makes women appear in a negative light.

hello, i would like to develop a friendship with you.
i am sorry that man was so mean, no woman deserves that.
you should try dooney and bourke, they have nice bags in that range.
i do not care what others say, someone will lose a trailer.
tell the person why it is over.
ask yourself, what love is.
i apolgize that man was such a rude person, no woman deserves to be treate with bad manners.
i would try dooney & bourke for some classic bags in the $135-$150 price range.
i understand other people disagree with my opinion but i still believe someone will lose a trailer.
i would explain to the man or the woman that the realationship is over.
i think you need to ask yourself what love is to you.
this type of decision is better made quickly rather than trying to think too deeply about it.
it is possible that he wants to be friends at present, but maintains hope of developing a relationship beyond friendship in the future.
the most important features are the eyes, wallet, and ears, in that order.
if he is not that sort of person, you should leave the relationshiop.
third party applications are not required.
are you hurt physically?
how do you get back at an unfaithful person?

let us not forget that they are young men, so they want sex.
if he is afraid of committment, that i do not know what you can do.
things can change any moment for the good.
love is what you make of it.
you try to forget everything good, and remember everything bad.
i do not know, and i have had sex before!
total how much you have to work with.
if you live in alabama, it is funny.
he gets nervous around you and says stupid things.
take them to chuck 'e cheese or anythign 5 year old kids like now.
i suppose he is a duck hunter, buy her some waders.
be rid of him and do not give it away.
you are aware that he is a married man.
perhaps it is like you are kissing their?
i am aware that she has been with him as of late.
you should say something along the lines of, "hey, would you like to have something to eat?"
try setting her up on a blind date with a guy that has some morals.
it is not about him or you; its about us. make sure it is real please.
you have got it all wrong!
when you feel hurt that means you care for the person.
i have to admit that after some really good sex, you get a certain feeling of primal possessiveness.

yes, i request inappropriate things frequently.
it may work again since it worked previously.
it is like any other group of people. compatibility is not always easy.
my work here is done.
then you should get on with your life.
just tell it to him directly.
be there for her in good, and the bad, as you always have,
sometimes girls like you more when you test them.
if you find out that he likes men, you should confront him.
please give me some advice, i am not sure if i am a homosexual or not. please tell me something that makes me feel happier.
sometimes we have to go through many tests before we find the right person.
you should talk to your family first, this is the best place to start.
i think that you should keep trying.
the woman at home must not be good to him anymore.
little hugs and kisses, touching, things like that.
why do you need a free girlfriend?
most women want to that they are wanted and sexy.
share your thoughts with her directly.
is that what you are inquiring about?
i apologize.  i thought you were a homosexual.
a woman of plain appearance who is thoughtful and charitable.
perhaps you should try to convince him that you would like to pursue a more mature, stable relationship.
we must individually act in our collective self-interest while ensuring the group as a whole works to benefit of each individual.
my former partner cheated on me and frequently lied, among other things.
be careful not to leave the christmas list in a place where the children might see it.

if you do not mean it, then you should not say it.
in my experience people who put forth strong effort typically end up with something other than what they were attempting to get.
don't worry about your appearance.  there is someone out there who will like the way you look.
i believe it is time for you to leave her.  the women over here is your best option.
it appears all has return to normal.
is it that you just don't care for him any longer?
then it will not matter whether you are officially married, because you will be husband and wife again.
even if he is not a homosexual, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are cheating.
do not waste your time "dating". just renew the marriage and make it work.
i think that you should talk to him about it.
i did once, many years ago.
yes. it will depend on the person, and how honest they are with you.
a gift will be a big mistake.
if this is the case, weigh the pro's and con's by making a list on paper.
you will need to choose between the two.
you will never know if you do not ask.
if you really love him , you would know size does not matter.
do not worry he will come to you.
i believe some do and some do not.
how do you know he would not do the same to you?
if it does not make you happy why do it?
his physical size should not matter if you really do love him.
he will appear soon, don't worry.
you have the same chance of doing something or not doing something.
how do you know he will not repeat the same actions if he were to date you?
may i ask why you are doing this because you aren't very happy?
i know how to keep my apartment neat, do laundry ,etc.

i suggest that you simply be honest about your incompatibility and leave the relationship.
are you referring to emails and similar communications?
if she behaves in such a manner, you should not be friends with her.
some people want it every day and, for other, twice a month is sufficient.
in addition, the touching things have really improved.
women have less affairs because they are scared of being cheated on by the guy they're involved with.
it sounds as if you love the person but, feel as though they do not love you.
things i find seducing are intelligence, a sense of humor, great teeth and smile, large height, manly cologne. whereas, things i find repulsing are sarcasm, ignorance, bad hygeine, materialistic views, unemployment.
the key is to add some allure; sex, sex, sex!
life never quite turns out the way people envision it to.
the love they deserve to have.
gentlemen must tell many falsehoods when speaking to ladies.

no matter what, do not discard a friendship with a male friend just to please your boyfriend
i would like to ask you all for recommendations on where i might go for fun, such as maybe san francisco or lake tahoe.
this is the same reason that women do. you could ask any lesbian about that.
it could be possible that it doesn't mean you are a loser.
it is always easier to find items when you stop searching.
i believe it is ignorant to find people here- we were told not to.
nice guys are seen in a brotherly way rather than romantically.
if you are male, you could be fourteen and with a teacher but if you are female, you must be twenty one.
be honest, and try your best attempt.
in all seriousness, you should not ask her if you don't wish to include her.
the choice is yours what happens next.
it would likely bother me if he did not do so.
of course you can love a person, even if you are unmarried.
so be honest with people and try your luck.
seriously, if you do not want her, do not ask her.
the rest is up to you.
it would probably bother me if he did not.
you can love a person even if you are not married.
if i were you, i would walk away. the ghost might not hear you.

girls go crazy for my eyes and muscles. i'm curious, what are your three best features?
have you gotten him anything for his birthday?
do not go into great details, especially the mom part.
the moral of the story is do nt be something you are not, be yourself.
do the "i do noy want to screw up with you" line.
so many things to do here, if you speak portugese.
do not show him that you really like him. it might scare him.
have you ever asked a girl on a date?
if she allows you to lick her feet then you might have to fulfill her odd fetish as well.
oh my, i did not realize i could go for so long.
saying, 'i love you'; is there an unwritten rule about women never saying the words first?
depending on how deep you know eachother, about common interests and a lot more.
it is ok to fall in love with a young, single guy.
even if the man is not gay, it is not concidered cheating.

maybe you have not found the right girl or noticed the right girl?

mine is doc; hers is kimber.
do nt feel bad. my son is 31 and still single.
get out and smell the coffee.
they can leave without any problem.
this one does not care about you.
just tell her or write her a note.
is that because i am a giant gorilla and she is a woman?
in other words, if you are dating a gigolo, do not fool yourself into thinking that he is prince charming.
all i can say is this: you know her and you know what she likes.
prepare for an odd and short story.
it only matters how you use it and not the size of it.
since it is a fact, i can deal with it.
personally, you need to pick.
just file and be done if there is nothing you disagree about.
guys in a nutshell are jerks.
if he treats you or the baby badly, then i would say no.
when we kiss, no matter how badly either of us want to, we do not.
i do not see why there is such a fuss over sex before marraige.
maybe she has her eyes on some other guy and you stepped into her line of vision.
if you feel hurt all the time then you need to find someone else.
trust me, you do not want to mess with her!
oh my, where did that come from?
perhaps you don't know what being lonely means?
anyone that says they love you would never put you in a harmful situation.
if you love the woman then marry her.
you have it in your id it says cacth me.
get to know the woman, and no matter what her size, if you have a connection, it will not matter.
she may love you in return.
if you love the woman then you should marry her.
the reason is because you have it in your identification, i am available to be in a relationship.
a fit and aesthetically pleasing body type, style, their face, and so on.
build a relationship with the woman. do this despite her physical attributes, because if there is a mental connection the physical appearance tends to matter less in the attraction of individuals.
it is possible that she will like you in return for you favors!
it seems as if your only option is to guess and hope for the best outcome.
after dinner, it is suggested to engage in a fun activity such as bowling.

whatver you do, do not have one of your parents call to break up with him for you.
i will know by the care and feeling she shows around me.
and if they think that they are, it is a good indication that they are not.
only foolish men cheat.
find out what she really wants and be that if you can.
he has no desire to talk to her.
it is frustrating but also a blast.
do not listen to any of them, they are wrong.
this is my 4th post.
stop wasting your time and his, just leave already.
i am invested in a man that i have been dating but we are not officially a couple yet.
now i purchase items for him that he will enjoy.
we are trying to train you to do anything that we need.
you do not need someone there to make it negative.
personally, i like to go down the street and purchase a big mac when i am hungry to fill me up.
maybe he is talking to you because he likes you and he is trying to fill the silence.
most of the nice women are married.
i think that at that age, you are only just beginning to live.
however, i do not recommend trying to impress her in only that way, because there is more to relationships than sex.
if he wants a relationship with her, then he will not tell her what you had said.
most women like with a guy can make her laugh.
if you slug that phony in the face, you will probably feel better!
something cute and simple, like a teddy bear or even a poem.
the majority of gentlemen will accept the situation
revenge returns no value. ignore the cad and forget his foolery.
i enjoy the clubs because of the high volume music and large herds of females.
ladies tend to find me at mid-range. in some cases this is important. in others, it is moot.
it is always preferable to take a lady out to dinner and not to your house.
he cheated, how do i get rid of it?
she became my wife.
if you like a girl, do not get to know her as a friend first.
girls do that anyway, whether they are conscoius of it or not.
wait untill you find the right one that you love.
also, you can start a conversation.
regardless of the situation, you can step toward him first.
when the time is perfect, the perfect man for you will arrive.
fifth, you don't care about their appearance or other qualities, and you can't say why you like them.
one more thing: wear short clothing of some kind.
it's a fact, not a mean joke.
here's my phone number. call me and we can get to know each other.
there's no harm in letting kids indulge their beliefs.
when she continues to flirt with you.
come on everyone, we are not picking on you.
if you really want to get to know me call me at my number.
let the child believe what they believe.
as a woman, i would say it is difficult for me.
when talk a lot when they speak with each other.
can you tell from that itself how she is being true to you?
unless you're materialistic, that is not a reason to leave your boyfriend.
of course she does, until he grows tired of her and moves on to his next conquest.
when a female is doing a good job as a wife and mother she has higher self esteem.
you should not be with anyone who will not love you as much as you love them.
if you find it hard to discuss this with him, maybe you should write him a letter.
you should just tell it as though it is a joke, just say it out loud.
do you know what is the matter with them lately?
it is a significant event, especially with a shy girl.
i must have everything including love.
a small number of men find too much responsibility very upsetting.
however, there are a large variety of possible causes to account for her nature.
however, i wish i did as we are all so different from, and consistently attempt to impress, each other.
it is a feeling in my guts.
perhaps you are scaring guys off.
i do not know what to do.
i see that it is free.
give her time to feel at home.
you will know if he truly loves you.
get her a gift card. that way you won't have to worry about anything.
i'm really not that masculine looking, more in between masculine and feminine.
i'm a man. i like when when my girl puts her breasts in my faace.
this is something i know about. my advice to you is; honesty is the best policy.
that is true. it does come, then go, and no one knows.
she does not play. i however do.
i would like to become a master at sex. then i would like to get married and teach my wife all i knew.
then, they had sex, and she left him.
dancing and movies.
do you really think he is blowing you off?
i do not know what is wrong with him.
some people are attracted to big girls.
you can observe the actions of someone you happen to see and like.
he is sitting behind me and answering questions right now.
magic like that can only exist in fairy tales.
why is it that they seem content just conversing among themselves with no need for anything else?
i come across women of this variety often.
if that is not the case it is unfortunate. however, now you know and she will be happy.
everything considered, it is time to do something different.
some women wonder why more men do not remain faithful.
if he loves it, then you must respect him.
wear something flattering but not too revealing.
it is a way of showing love that is unlike any other.
i do not mean what you implied but you could go on a blind date through yahoo or google personals.
i still wanted to send it to him, but i never got a response.
pretend that she does not exist.
try asking him for a reason.
just go for it. although, i think that you should start from the eighth grade and beyond.
once there, stay in the center of the action.  do not hide out in the kitchen.
it was a stainless steel set. this is very practical for everyday use.
should i be honest and admit i do not want her in it?
you do not. you each need to move on.
it seems as if girls pick other girls best friends.
to begin with, many men are attracted to larger women. it comes down to personal preferences.
what he does is his thing.
i can not go back to someone like that now, can i?
he will probably cheat on you again.
now she is talking to this new guy and i found out that is is also hanging out with him.
there is so much more that both of you have. take the time to find it.
i do not trust these online companies that search for people.
i have been told that i should not look because she will find me.
i saw him naked with her.
let us kiss and find out what we need to know.
when you are looking for love you never find it.
i have something private i would like to share with you.
if you need additional answers, please be sure to telephone me at 307-351-2765.
would you be comfortable with my hugging your friends when you greet them?
if you take this opportunity right now, i believe you will achieve your goal.
you can either search the directory for her contact information or just head out to find her in person.
continue and occupy your time better.
additionally, next time do not be so lacking in intelligence as to say things you will later regret.
god reserves the best for last.
(afterwards ask him if you could still discuss it in person to formalize the agreement.
that girl is my friend in some ways.
a turn off from the start is that "i love you" stuff- have confidence!
i do not think there is anything wrong as long as you love that person.
talk to her lovingly, but do not be pushy.
do what your heart tells you to.
i can not stop thinking about the girls that i know. is it ok for me to have sex?
what if i am not able to have children?
young adults lack the attention to know what they want.
should i ask the girl at my school out on a date?
i have not planned many, however, my input is 7000-10000.
pass to him the hints which you prefer.
merry christmas! this gift comes from my heart. i hope she will always love it.
if your love for this gentleman is strong, then the situation is moot.
you will understand your feelings when you have matured,
affirmative, the gentleman has entered into an adulterous affair.
i am familair with the subject matter on which i am speaking.
tell him, then start making a list.
no, but i would be-friend them.
and that your friends are only friends.
i do not like short hair for girls.
the hand belonging to you, or your sock?
why are men unable to remain in their homes while watching sports on television without their friends?
i do not believe men should ever strike women.
why not remain at home and speak?
if you hurt someone like that then you do not love them.
it is as if you can not tell your girlfriend/wife about it.
not all girls like rich boys; some like fat boys. i hate the rich type personally.
there are websites for that with plenty of single women.
who knows, he might be doing something nice for you?
for success in life do your school work.
some find shy girls attractive when they imitate a blush with red powder.
there is not need to get upset.
do you plan on meeting?
the words are differentiated by the words note and word.
come on, everybody has at least once insane one.
and make it very clear that is what you want once you have him hooked.
it is not that guys do not want to help.
let him know what you feel.
chance are he will be back.
the wallet is not necessary, but preferential.
speaking to yourself seems peculiar, but it does assist.
bring the children with your spouse.
is there anything else?
i am aware that you would not like to pay.
am i the only one that can do this?
when i stop talking and then do it in front of him loudly, he gets the message.
that is not bad, but pracital.
if you are too shy to flirt, do not do it.
think of it as a breast trifecta.
or, perhaps, it is just a thing to you.
women do not want a man that can be easily ran over.
i am thick and i have never had a problem.
boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but your true friends will always be there for you.
you have a lot of growing to do; 23 is very young.
you cannot go wrong with a single rose.
did you have intercourse with the man or not?
my parents do not care for it; my mother says, "well, if they make you happy." all while my dad despises it.
now, i have a man who i am courting that would never fathom to think of another woman.
realize the truth of the matter.
in the recent past, i would have responded like you.
share this with your girlfriend, and i predict she will agree.
would that not mean things like trust, care, and respect for someone?
he is a past romantic partner because he belongs in the past.
what if i were to cheat on my boyfriend since we do not have any relations?
he may have feelings for you but has reasons for holding back
i hope you found that useful. be sure to treat her to a memorable time.
those who do not have missed a great opportunity.
it is primarily him.
if you are asking that question, then i cannot respect you.
because, they may not like you, and wouldn't want you to know things.
does anyone know what i should do?
they also do not like men of other races or color, but, do you know what?
people at school think that i am nerd.
second of all, none of my lesbian friends do not hate me; they do not find men attractive.
until one comes along and they start begging and pleading.
if you do not feel hurt, that just proves that you do not care about him or her.
tell him that you do not want him to do that any longer.
is this the kind of relationship you want from a partner?
no, as long as they have an orgasm, weight doesn't matter.
you don't have to move to africa.
choose one to pick up and try.
i really like him. he asked me out last year. before we did anything, i told him no.
raising kids as gay is immoral.
good luck with the boyfriend and happy holidays!
why not? he might just be mr. right.
why bother in the first place?
i guess the only concolation to that situation is honesty.
i know that is how my friends are, but do not lie, i am already good.
us women are not so complex creatures.
if he says no and you believe him, there you go.
how can i forget it in my mind?
why not just ask her adn go from there?
sounds like an excuse, but you can always kick the kids out sometime.
she will love a nice, simple gift received from you.
if your love is causing emotional pain you must end the relationship.
repeat this sentiment: "we men are insecure."
do not dwell on the relationship as she would have found you if she so desired.
you must simply be charming and sweet as girls enjoy these characteristics.
he will tell her what you said if they are just friends.
if it is his, he will know.
first, consider getting a dictionary. so that way you are able to spell the work anniversary.
what is so funny; he is only 20 years old.
a guy who really cares for you will make the time to call and say hello.
do you forgive him and stay, or do you figure it as a love-crime and leave?
try writing it better.
he just wants to use you anytime.
i like to think they will understand and protect you.
please take the right step and do some deep thinking before making any decision.
did you not promice to love, honor, etc?
if you do not mean it, do not say it.
tell me how things go.
if you have to ask, he probably is.
there is nothing wrong with flirting with a guy.
i did not like kissing or having sex with men.
i am a guy and i really enjoy limerick poems.
i pick it up and stare at it.
then, even if she has a drink already, hand her another one.
never go to a movie on a first date.
(that is even more modern thinking.)
let her know that you would rather leave than cheat because that is how much you care about her.
one day they want you to give them space and the next day they want a relationship!
to identify it would be a completely different task.
i would prefer to have no contact with her is she cannot be around weapons.
before the words "i love you" can be spoken it has to be felt.
do not be hasty to quit as these things tend to take time. if you are interested in them try it again.
take your pick from a neighbor's house to enjoy a holiday with her.
most women prefer it to be just them two.
do not waste your life over one girl.
i would date them both.
first of all, what kind of guy says he would never ---- as you put it in?
smile please and think about it.
look around, take what you want and have a good time.
you are going to end up with one thousand cats and rats if you do not stop.
it is because they think that there is something that they are missing.
you do need to love getting older.
you deserve someone who will only look at and want you.
if not, you should probably talk to a grandparent or close friend.
i would like to be your friend.
now i'm with a girl i totally trust; she and i are both very happy.
do not give away that you are interested in him.
try giving him a test first, and then you can more easily make the decision on whether to end things.
do not give into pressure to do things you would rather not do.
i would be willing to date someone of a different race. all people need love.
i would like a woman who is fat, hairy, obese, and belittles me in public.
do you hang out with your friends?
the question should be, "am i in love with him?" not "do i love him?"
do the household chores she hates the most!
do not let him and he will not.
say, "hey momacta, let me hit that!"
you probably have not been looking in the right places but do not worry, there is someone for everyone.
take what you will from it.
you may not realize, but men are just as confusing as women.
until then, hang in there.
this is just something your mind has made up.
dating the sibling of an ex-partner is never a good idea.
that would be dependent on whether she likes you too.
if you are both agreeable to having religious differences, then there is no reason not to marry.
i would recommend ee cummings. there is plenty of poetry men enjoy.
i am not this way, but my husband is.
some men are just stupid like that.
it is doable.
if i was her, i would want to go to a movie and then go out to eat.
just spend some time hanging out.
accept and be friends with him.
he tends to purchase items which he desires, so he has no need for anything.
i dislike him. he is not good for you, you can do better than that.
yes, do what you want, it is your life.
it is alright to be afraid, but do not allow that to stop you.
try to accept him and just be friends.
he usually buys things if he wants them, so he may not need anything.
i do not like him, he is not good for you, you can do better.
do what you want it is your life.
it is ok to be afraid but do not let that stop you.
it all depends if you love him or not.
now think, whether it could happen with your ex or not.
be a friend and dont let your feeling for her get you further away from your goal.
feed that person. that should keep them quiet for awhile.
that should shut them up.
i love sleeping with my wife.
it is possible if you have to ask yourself that question.
i love him so much i don't want our relationship to end.
there is nothing wrong with having sex after marriage.
they had previously had it with someone else.
just remember, it does matter.
tell me if you found an answer.
i think that age is nothing but a number.
as for me, i am not sure if i want to get married any time soon; i am young with little experience.
i have a feeling she is seeing another man but, i am not sure.
this is just my opinion.
therefore, every night he has to lie in the bed where his girlfriend and best friend made love together.
i want to see what keeps her motivated everyday.
before you confess your attraction to them, give them a hint or flirt a bit.
you are not a terrible person just because you have needs.
i wish i was that lucky!
you need to set a budget.
it is a good thing i like the twilight zone music.
he is not worth it.
se said you are all about spending money when i told him about movies, carnivals, eating out, and a concert.
and he will not already have a wife, correct?
unintelligent person, that was an unintelligent question!
due to the fact that men tell lies simply for the sake of thinking they can do so with no repercussions.
the best suggestion is to not ask men out on dates.
i do not believe that it is a true statement that lesbians hate men.
i concur, there's good and bad... just familiarize yourself with them.
this is a simplified overview of a more detailed whole.
if you're not sure how to operate it, hand it to me.
a friend of mine would like to know.
i'm in one at the moment, and i love it.
if you simply want to play but are not the serious type then tell her that as well.
then i became a bit less aggressive.
no, that is very attractive. what has been happening, darling?
a person has only one soul mate and true love.
coincidentally, my boyfriend and and i will meet you there because we are getting married as well.
just tell him or her how you feel honestly or don't let him or her near you anymore.
there is no one good enough for a truly nice guy.
choose pink. feminine girls love pink and butterflies.
sue her for libel.
i think you got the question wrong.
what are you speaking of?
we are not the same even as a few generations back.
do not waste tons of time doing so.
communicate with her and if she loves you, she will brush this man off.
they are from two different planets.
what in the world are you referring to
our generation is not alike from the older generation
do not lose alot of time completing this
maintain proper communication with her and she will no longer be interested in another
reason is that they are from two different planets!
if i hurt my best friend i would admit and offer an apology.
what is playing at the fox theater on new years day 2006?
i would follow her suggestion and just be friends moving forward.
if you are interested in the gentleman you should ask him out on a date.
you risk losing both if you do not follow through.
you should buy her underwear.
when i am asked why i do not get married, i just say, "what for"?
that is too bad you do not have an avatar.
if he believes you are cheating, break up with him.
do not worry, there are people who never cheat.
no offense but she does not sound very interesting.
there is also this that men do not like unkept women.
i hope kaely lykins loves me as i love her.
yes i have two girlfriends and we are close.
no offense, but she does not sound very interested.
there is also this statement:  guys do not like bushy privates.
like the mouth, or just the lips, or just the tongue, etc.
i will kaely lykins likes me!
yes, because i have two girlfriends and we are very close.
it depends on how she feels; if she has stayed for that long, i bet it is good to get married.
have fun but do not date again untill you are sure you can not get him back.
it is a guy thing, do not fall into that trap- take control and you call the shots.
if they are single they probably want to stay that way.
i do not understand why some girls like those guys at all.
some things you could do would be to get a new young canine companion, or watch movies like the american pie movies.
my advice would be to flirt with him and ask him if he was looking at you.
however, my friend, if you were caught playing around, it could get messy.
(that is how i would describe the sound.)
therefore, why should we just love one person?
try to get everyone concerned to care.
i cannot tell you anything because i do not have a boyfriend.
but they were still going out secretly and i did not know.
please leave comments as this was my most embarrassing moment.
if that does not work, then just ask her about it.
there is no price on love.
we danced together and kissed; we did not talk much but we feel as though we have talked so much already.
why so quick to end another marriage?
a kiss is something else i would add.
after the date is set, you can move on from there.
she is a sick woman and shame on her.
i hope that one day that there will be no need to ask a question like that.
how do you not know that?
no, he should break up with you for being shallow.
there are a few things i get so tired of asking and i get annoyed.
she is a disgusting woman, and she should be ashamed of herself.
my hope is that one day, this is a question that no one will have to ask.
i am very surprised you were not already aware of that.
certainly not. he should end his relationship with you, since you are so shallow.
i become annoyed because i am tired of having to ask about certain things so very often.
i do not think all mean cheat.
take an ice cube, crush it with your feet, and say "now i have broken the ice."
if he is cheating on you with other girls, tell him that the problem is and leave.
i think that you could go to the movies.
go out and buy somethign sexy to wear, even if it is just around the house.
so explain if you want advice, please. ;)
if you would not marry them, do not date them.
because it is very easy to say, but difficult to say in words.
so there is only the girl who wants things differently.
yeah, love can be at first sight.
if it were up to me, you would be packing your bags and hitting the road.
how are you treating and trusting your girlfriend?
you call her, but she does not answer the phone.
if he did not find women attractive, he would not have much interest in you!
guess what? i have lost my incentive to do these things.
it is also about playing with gadgets.
do not act like a stereotypical floozy.
you should determine how much money you will have.
if they say no, that is the final answer.
i have a friend whose father passed away last year. in that situation, you must first calm down.
nothing can get a girl going like horsepower. at least it works for me!
who don't women like short guys over tall ones?
i do not know what to do.
it is online dating, not line dating.
if a casual friend is asking, they are just making conversation.
if she is willing to go this far what will she be willing to do next?
yes, and there isn't anything there. it is only an empty space between your ears.
it does not take much to arouse a male. we are always ready to be aroused.
i think that the point of the drug is just that; to stay erect and to have endurance.
i know of many people who use it, and at least some of them are looking for relationships.
do not let your relationship go bad.
the reason is, i can see myself in them.
it means they do not want to hurt your feelings, because you obviously care more than they do.
you see, i do believe in love at first sight, though, it happens rarely.
he would not like it if you gawked at other men; tell him that and attempt to work it out.
if they ask, i would say oh, you!"
if you have crushes on guys and can not imagine being with a girl, that is gay.
she should just leave and not mess around on you.
if you like this guy you should go out with him.
stop sweating and start laughing, because i can be funny at times.
sweet talk and have some drinks with them.
i knew i liked women from a young age.

the same situation happened to me, he cheated on my with my best friend.
i would really like some advice.
just use sweet talk and get them drunk.
i knew i lvoed women at a young age.
do not ruin someone's life for your own gain.
the same thing happened to me, he was unfaithful to me with my best friend.
i could use some advise.
make yourself look good but still dress conservativly.
how can emotions create pain?
it is because they watch too much mtv.
he should trust you enough that you love only him.
i am interested in finding full figure women and attractive women with wonderful personalities.
sometimes you can love one person and love another equally.
sometimes people do not have good morals, but there are still people out there who do have good morals.
it is up to the both of you, if that is something that works for you two, than it is fine.
if you have to take a break so he can go on with you life, then do just that.
she obviously does not care if you get sick or not.

my younger brother has just turned 21, so i hope this has been helpful.
no, i think you just need a new beau.
i believe in lust and yearning at first sight.
what is there to not like about him?
if you two hang out after that, it means he likes you.
internet, street corners, house of ill repute, high school/college, mall.
go to a sports bar during any major event.
never give appearances of being nice just to try and win her affections again.
not only is it all right, it is also recommended.
my personal feeling is that my man treats me bad, and it needs to stop.
of course. if you are in a relationship, why shouldn't you?
they are simply toys. you can play with them on your own.
that is what it is like to be in love.
you are considered bisexual if you have a sexual desire for both males and females.
i think that pythons are gross and the girl is not in her right mind for letting it go.
it depends on what the kiss is like.

do not give up hope, she will be there.
it becomes a part of you. so when it is taken away, it truly hurts.

who cares about what they are doing?
maybe, do you own a toothbrush?
it seems that online, you all have good chemistry.
west coast swing is my favorite.
open your eyes and heart he may be there already; if you have faith.
is it asking too much to seek a woman who is around 38, educated, honest, attractive, interested in serious men, and faithful?
you need to put your foot down and be firm about not accepting that kind of behavior.
there are some mind games centering around pipe dreams.
if you have any advice for improvement, please inform me.
would that not also mean some men are promiscuous?
it feels like he is flirting.

it had to have dropped by at least 50 points.
if you want to get back together with him, you should try to call him on the phone.
you should take a trip to australia.

if he has a nice smile, i cannot resist the urge to gaze at it.
i prefer big beautiful women over skinny girls.
it is how you use it and not how big it is.
eventually, your dad will get over it.
tell him that he is a disgrace to men.
mend do that all the time, my friend.
other men do not look good no matter what they do to their hair.
i am guessing you do not wish to be too wild.
that is just my ideas.
how do you when you love someone? if you do, you do not have to ask.
men do it all the time, girl.
other men, well, they just do not look good no matter what they do to their hair!
but i assume you mean that you do not want to get too wild.
but that is just my two cents!
how do you really know when you love someone?
if you know the girl you could ask any questions you like.
you have to love and respect the person you are going to make love to.

just be best friends with her father.
if she is truly using him he'll find it out if you give it time.
it is a hard thing to do but if you love the person then it is so worth it.
tell your new girls about her before anything goes beyond a first date.
so just take this advice, that at least one of you should use a condom.
you said that you are shy. you should use that trait to your advantage.
would he not get mad at you?
do this out in a nice, public restaurant. do not become desperate ever.
how rude. buy him cheap socks and underwear.
if you are not ready, then do not do it, even if that means ending the relationship.
nothing, he was there before you and he will be there after you.
i have never in my life felt the way i do now.
make you stronger, or destroy you?
my ex had very crooked teeth, but i was him that i liked so the teeth did not bother me.

ask him to do something sometime, if he likes you he will say yes.
that would be dependent on the two of you.

because they have figured out how easy we are.
i do not do much making eye contact or simply flirting.
no, what if she finds out that you are cheating?
guys try to be like their fathers.
because a real man does not need sex; he need a friend.
they never will until they lose you.
you can always try again once you decide he is done with his games.
tell her you already have a girlfriend.
there is not anything we do for fun.
i guess you have your answer.
i didn't choose not to be gay, i am not, and i would not want to be.
i agree, he is too old for you.

i have large breast and have seen the upside.
there is a correct option, but it depends on what you are looking for.

where do you live and what is your age?
i would advise you simply be yourself, not ask the internet for their opinions in the middle of the night.
if you are the one who asks him out, you will be paying for your own date.
i'm not sure. truthfully, i lost mine when i was ten.
it seems to me that you are extremely lonely.
how old are you? where do you live?
first of all, by not seeking answers and advice from the internet at two a.m. secondly, just act like yourself.
and remember, if you ask him out, you should then pay for the date.
if you love her, she'll love you back.
i've been more busy at work lately,and i'm enjoying life.
when she stated that you have changed, what did she mean?
as difficult as it can be, give her another opportunity. attempt to work things out for one last time.
if you go to yahoo personals, it will tell you.
why would she want to be with someone so boring?
i am not sure, but it is illegal so yes.
if he is actually nice then he would let me finish first.
it depends, it would be earlier if their parents won't disown them for it.
she is the woman of my dreams, the woman i have always wanted to spend my time with.
i do not understand why she would choose to date a man who is boring.
i am not positive, but due to it being illegal, i would have to say yes.
if he is a true gentlemen, he would make sure the woman went first.
it isn't for certain, it does depend on how their parents feel about it.
white with the bow already on top would cost approximately 10 to 15 dollars.
and that is the truth. i am not joking.
a man could give me flowers and that would mean more to me than giving me a ring would any day.
that is too manly, but only because some men try to conform.
but it sounds like it is better to move forward.
14 or 15 or above is best.
i'm just wondering if he falls for it.
the attractive man is quite rude when he is into you.
where should i go to get to know him.
do you have any suggestions on gifts that might be suitable for her?
i consider age to be just a number unless the person is under-age and therefore it is a crime.
i happen to be working on the same problem.
what should i discuss with them - the weather?
the first step is to let her know that you like her and await a response.
i know from experience that sometimes men do not know a good thing until it is gone.
that, and getting on with your life...
mine did it behind my back a lot... it just started a lot of fights.
i told her that i didn't approve of it, so she said she didn't want to see me anymore.
somehow, though, they always end up thinking you really like them.
from previous experience, men are unaware they have something worth keeping until they have lost it.
while that is important, so is getting on with your life.
mine often did this without my knowledge, it caused much conflict.
i informed her that i didn't approve of it, and she informed me that the relationship was ending.
it always ends the same, with them believing you really like them.
two wrongs do not make a right!
also, why did you marry him if you didn't have anything to talk about?
maybe he is a realy nice guy but just wants to take it slow.
if it's less than five, if might not be that bad.
do nothing sexual and see if he goes for it.
just say, "hi, your look familiar".
if she is simple then make it simple, it is about her.
there is a girl who i go to high school with who is extremely mean.
go on yahoo chat, or go out to skate parks or similar things.
i am sorry i have not called. i just think you are very pretty and you are a great person. however, i do not think you like me.
of course, i love my family very much. my family also loves me very much.
you do not have to do anything if you do not want to.
i would leave it alone after that.
maybe she likes seeing you angry.
then you have a bit of a problem.
perhaps it is because they are not worn on the right side.
however, step by step, a feeling of friendship got stronger, as well, and she truly became my friend.
type "find people" on yahoo search.
i do not understand why you ask such a question.
of course, that is what marriage is supposed to be.
what you need is not the police, but a lawyer, and a lot of money.
if that is true, would i be wrong to miss him and still want him back?
we don't act superior. maybe the problem is that you have low self-esteem and think that boys act superior.
there is a difference between truly loving you and merely liking you because you give him sexual pleasure.
however, if you want to make up a percentage, it is 43.795684 percent.
i have windows xp, and my previous computer had windows 98.
yes, a boyfriend is a boyfriend!
my boyfriend got really angry when i broke up with him the second time.
merry christmas and i hope that you and your family will always be blessed by god.
you will know right away if this is going to click.
staring at how big of humps there are in guys' pants.
explain to him that you don't want a two-timer as a boyfriend.
using you as a rebound, but not even getting there.
maybe try to see what kind of guys she is into.
it is easy to tell if something will work, or if something is meant to be.
you need to make clear to him that you will not accept someone who is unfaithful.
perhaps it could help finding out the type of man she is interested in.
get an examination from a doctor to know there is nothing wrong, or if there is, get treatment.
be well or talk with tan; i am sure she is nice and would be a good friend.
what did you do before you were married?
maybe he is doing it purposefully to make you jealous.
when you are comfortable and happy, then you know it is good. you are doing this the correct way.
unfortunately aside from continuing as you are the situation is out of your control.
i feel more affectionate to him than any other in my experience, but he chooses to not communicate with me.
two inches is not sufficient to complete the job.
i hope your questions have been rectified by the information you have been given.
i suggest you continue forward as the adolescents are aware of differences between their biological father and a new romantic interest.
girls can better relate to them since they mature faster.
but only if you become his new mom.
they just want to score.
hey girl, be quiet you idiot. why do you think !
although it would seem so now, afterwards there won't be a big difference.
girls mature faster than boys and can often relate better.
that is only possible if you become his girlfriend.
they are only out to hide the facts.
i would appreciate it if you stopped giving us your input.
it may seem as if it is a big deal now, but in the future you will find it doesn't really matter.
what do you mean by base? what big relationship are you referring to?
yes, sex is love, because during sex you show your partner your feelings.
is she the right one or a bad one?
if that is so, look in the phone book.
nothing matters for me but whether a person is good-natured.
i have confronted her and informed the teachers but she will not stop.
i suggest you purchase some very stylish shoes; it seems to make an impression.
i suggest that you simply tell him about your feelings.
it seems to be an old instinct among mammals - the more the merrier when it comes to tribal pride.
see if he enjoys it or not.
he is the person who is always supportive of you no matter what.
the difference is men do not have the stigma of being labeled loose hanging over their heads.
if you do not take care of your man or woman, he or she will go to someone else to get what he or she is missing.
we do this in order that you will give it to us more.
i would probably date you as long as you are not married.
my problem now is that i can't be with her but i don't want to be without her.
i lost mine at age 12 and it is a little young.
i apologize if that hurts, but i size men up for their total worth just as you do. so do men.
he tells her that all of her friends are not in relationships, but are on the lookout for partners.
you can use any of the dating sites - yahoo, match, or cupid among examples.
i am very knowledgeable about this.
i cannot make this formal, it is inherently sexual in every way.
i know that a lot of men are attracted to lesbian relationships.
i believe this was a mistake for her.
is that who he is?
if you don't feel the same, you don't.
you should do it, worst she could say is no. that's better than having a doubt.
valentino's pizza is at 975 north aviation boulevard.
i believe that appearances do matter, so get used to it.
will it not make you nervous to make such an important decision.
i want you to continue licking.
i feel badly because this is a terrible movie.
may i be your boyfriend?
you should have to tell her!
first, you are not going to marry this person, so you're in no rush to be in a relationship.
is looking him up on the internet too much?
so, i wish to know everything that has to do with love as a young man. thanks.
anyway, you will find someone that likes you enough, and will not be bothered by your exe's stories.
somebody i can trust, who trusts me, would be like a best friend.
make conversation and do not ask simply yes or no questions. good luck!
the consequences are not worth it.
you need to experience this; otherwise, you will be disappointed.
are you asking if i believe in fate?
it is good that you look around you.
don't you know it does matter because it cannot be too small.
making someone's life hell on earth, is simply not worth the energy it requires.
you should find an activity that you can both enjoy.
it may seem like silly advice, but this is what worked for me.
this is not something that only happens to me.
i assume they were just masturbating, what are their ages?
my guess would be that they man would get double the pleasure.
i would find an activity that both of you like and then ask him on a date.
this may be unusual but it was successful for me.
this is not something that only pertains to men.
(i imagine they were pleasuring themselves) what were their ages?
it is likely because the man would get more appreciation.
but you must remember that you are stealing his bachelor party from him.
if he only wants to be friends with you, then you must keep the relationship on a friends level.
then just listen to what she says and build off of that.
there are good men in the world, but it is difficult to stay away for a long time.
it depends on if there are children involved and if the ex- partner is still going to be around.
why not try to spice things up?
read sparks' a walk to remember, and watch the movie.  both are very good!
if i were in your shoes, i would move out.
so you're very rude for not making her feel loved.
what about the city of troy?
you should try to spice it up with him.
you should read spark's _a walk to remember_, which is also a movie.  both are really good!
if i were you, i would move out.
for not making her feel loved, you are an a-hole.
how about with the city of troy?
just after it, and that is it.
you had best try as hard as you can.
try something new, and it that does not work, cheat on him.
we will be getting married next year!
it is the same thing with my friend and me.
if you love him, he will reciprocate your love.
you should try and form a relationship with her.
i just read this book, and i think you should as well.
hello, i was wondering if you would go on a date with me.
the answer is affirmative
if you love him, he will reciprocate that feeling.
it is not only important that you try and date her.
i highly recommend this book to everyone.
do you think you would be interested in spending the evening with me?
if something is done for 30 days, it can become a habit. best wishes.
depends on if it is jail bait.
since when is it okay for anyone to cheat?
there are too many material objects out there to buy.
how can i help her to really have a good time during sex.
it is acceptable if you do love them.
i would like a good girl; you would like a good guy.
if you decide to give cash i suggest giving $75 or $100.
you should have sex with her; it would be worth any repercussions from him.
you just have to patient and demonstrate that it's acceptable and not just say so.
i love him very much, yet i question if i am in love with him.
he was divorced just 4 months ago, and he is still working to get over her.
only during the first meeting, then step by step you can increase.
i am not saying all men are like this, but a good number of them are.
go out to a fun place nearby, where others are spending time, such as a mall.
don't speak just look in her eyes show her affection with kisses an something will occur.
nice guys aren't always the best looking nor are they gay!
i'm positive when a girl likes you she will show you a sign.
so what exactly is ghetto to you?
just calm yourself down an focus on being the funny good looking person you are.
i am not quite sure, but anyway, it is.
take a walk in the park; even though it is cold, you can snuggle as you walk.
no, you just need a girlfriend.
so, i would advise you to stick with those that write to you.
if she is not impressed, the she is probably not right for you anyway.
you need a girls help, and i am one.
do not worry about it first off.
right, he needs a friend not a lover.
well, get her something you know she will like.
you should tell him you know what is going on and to come clean.
it means that he does not want to be around you.
if he likes you, then he will work with your circumstances.
it is time to get over it and move on, because no one is worth the pain you are putting yourself through.
you will find that is was worth waiting for.
i believe that there is not a gift anywhere that is better than the gift of love.
i do not know where else to go except the movies!
it is "the queen of the damned" soundtrack.
what in the world do you mean by that?
stop right away if she is in a relationship.
if he was willing to consider what you said, then he is the right one for you.
they ask you how much money you have and other things like that.
he could be a child that is fifteen years of age who has acquired a deep voice.
if they share the same mental approach as you do towards life, then why not?
he had seen a surround sound system yesterday that cost around one hundred dollars.
nice men are generally the men who second guess themselves more than men who are more into physical appearance.
i concur that starting the conversation with a friendly hello is a good step.
you will experience feelings on a day by day basis.
if she did that to you then she doesn't sound like a very good friend.
perhaps she wants to have sex with you but possibly not.
the same event happens to me.
if she mentions that then you should inquire about what happened.
if it were me, i would meet him and determine what his opinion of you might be and see what develops.
all you have to do is go up and ask her.
a guy cheats on a girl to see what another girl has to offer.
tell her to leave you.
if you tell him you do not want to be in a relationship with him anymore, and he still decides to come back to you, then he is worth keeping.
if this does not work, then leave her, because she has feelings for the other man.
but, what is the worst thing that could happen if you asked the woman out on a date?
no, some men do not masturbate. either they do not like to, or they just do not want to.
i suggest you try to meet some new friends.
after you have given birth you will love the expeience.
make sure to purchase some condoms before going any further.
he let her know that he loves her and wants to be more than friends.
in all likelihood it looks better, although i usually don't run spell check.
it may not work out between you two.
it's alright if he makes you happy.
he got in trouble following behind his friend.
odds point in favor of him ending the relationship again.
i am moderately attractive and i have a great personality, i am also tall and intelligent.
it appears that either you like to keep people happy or you are a bully.
i was injured when the person i was completing the task with wasn't educated in the project.
i find myself in the same scenario
she needed some time to relax and be with friends.
do not proceed unless you are interested.
be yourself and tell the truth.
do not give your time to someone who does not want to be with you.
you should find satisfaction on your own, then try to think about her.
if it is the truth, then you should reveal it!
letting him go will help both of you.
depending on the guy, you could whisper in his ear.
people say you must have friends before you have lovers.  maybe this is a good thing.
request that he use his credit cards.
the more you look, the less mistakes you will make.
do not change who you are for her.
if she likes you, then it is just fine.
approach him or her like a friend you already know.
they are probably thinking of porn stars, anyway.
when he said he was just kidding, he really meant not to get mad.
approach her and cravenly beg her to like you because you like her.
sometimes, love is just a funny thing.
even though we cannot do anything yet, i do this to my man all the time.
you have a good sense of humor and are attractive, am i correct?
please clarify why it is harder!
if she says no, let that be the end of it.
you just need to find them.
just keep on looking until something clicks.
well, i say to just ignore them and do what you want to.
if she really wanted to come back, she would not have done all the things she did.
you will find out afterwards; happy hunting!
please send this message again, but by phone, to +90 536 463 83 47.
i do not know if i am a virgin.
i do not want someone who may kill over the next day.
be careful on the relationships you might be asked to join in prison.
she is too respectable for that.
he comes up with an excuse.
do not wait to take a chance, for others may be waiting to take it first.
most likely because they're selfish, ignorant, or need relief.
trust me when i say women enjoy better soft, gentle sex.
first, ask your mind, then listen to your heart.
it's similar to the love of your parents, but slightly different.
it's polite to dance with someone if they ask, even if you don't want to.
there are several fish in the ocean.
does he want me back, or dos he really dislike me that much?
do not worry about it too much if you mess up; just tell her how i became engaged.
maybe they do, but they are scared to talk to you; just be yourself.
what kind person would use you like that and consider themselves your best friend?
you cannot love a person whom you don't know.
is there anything i can say to her that might undo her brainwashing?
wait about five years before marrying again.
if things go well, you will know.
he can get into quite serious trouble.
in fact, three hours would not be enough time for me.
ll, with his lips, is quite a man.
ask her if she will share your husband's baby pictures, and learn about the family.
neither of the two choices, but rather the amount of money the man has.
you cannot make him do anything, he has to want to do it.
send him a picture of yourself, let him see you, and talk to him!
do you love him, or do you just want to be with an older man?
if you love the person, you must really work past it.
i would love you forever if you were on television or in the movies.
men who love their wives do not cheat.
then, you will look back when you are old and say, "what in the world was i worried about?"
it sounds to me like you have a little situation here.
if you are in love with him and feel so inclined, why not?  just be aware that this will not last over the long term.
even though he never did it again, it is always present in the back of my mind.
if you want the abridged version...
despite what others may say, two parents are better than one.
if it is not meant to be, let it go.
get out on a date, enjoy your life, and have some fun!
buy a strap on, which isn't as good, but oh well.
no, cheating is cheating and rape is rape.
i am searching or the answer myself.
i have never attempted it with kenny g. but i bet it would be a good try.
it is no trouble, you'll have the results soon.
i have strong feelings for a woman at church.
i am unsure of what my next step should be.
if you have to ask for the information, it is probably not real.
the first step would be to be kind to her.
do not bother them, just wait to find out.
i like a girl at church.
what should i do now?
it is a game if you have to ask.
to start with, you can be nice to her.
ask him what he is interested in.
while he goes out with his friends, she stays home instead of seeing hers.
what is she doing?
she may be speechless but she will say yes.
i told him to please keep my secret.
additionally, it is ignorant to say if you don't let him commit adultery, he will leave you.
i'm sorry; however, age will always be an issue.
ask him if he had any trouble finding your house, did his enjoy his dinner, and that sort of small talk.
if you cannot stop thinking about him or her, if you are intimidated by him or her
that seems like a bad situation.
he cannot care much if he is cheating.
let us keep a secret a secret.
obviously, you are not worried about your wife's feelings because you are having an affair with her husband. why?
girls are attracted to rough men with plenty of testosterone.
anywhere between the time of 5 to 45 minutes.
if he is stepping outside the relationship, he doesn't have strong enough feelings for you.
it is better to keep the secret than to tell
it is cleared you don't care about how his wife feels, you show that by having an affair with her husband.
women are often attracted to rugged men who show they are manly men.
it could last anywhere between five and forty five minutes.
guys always wonder what is wrong with some women.
she is married and has a child!
so, why do you guys think this happens?
or, the age difference, although that isn't really that much.
i don't know. we will find it some kind of way.
i need revenge or something. any ideas?
but, some have messed up teeth.
like the song says, "age ain't nuthin' but a number, baby!"
how about the question, "are you a virgin?"
my husband is rude to me too.
"dork" is not meant to be mean; i call everyone a "dork." however, it is true.
additionally, will you marry me?
i am just 18; however, most 50-year-olds will never have an opportunity to date a 24 year old.
if it were just us men, i would not think of mentioning it.
if you don't love, then you don't have friends.
it depends on if you met the guy in real life, because love also takes action.
be yourself, if you're funny, then make a girl smile.
nope, there is nothing you can tell her. she has to experience it for herself.
talk to him first. don't wait.
i am sorry to hear that that is so awful, but i agree with everyone in here.
to me, age is just a number.
he has a girlfriend now. i think he simply does not want me anymore.
and why does everyone give him such a hard time for knowing what he wants?
go to church and pray. seriously, it works. it worked for me.
you need to move on with your life.
i only see you two lasting, if you can get his mother to love you as well.
next time you see him, go up and speak with him.
attempt to do something extra special for him at christmas.
remember, the worst she could state is no.
of course it depends on what kind of girl she is.
accept it. unless you are obsessed with them, then seek professional help for your mental health.
well, don't do that. it would be cheating, and that is wrong.
if you would like to have a girlfriend at some point in time, you will need to ask a girl on a date.
don't ask her in front of an audience, or use pick-up lines, or other nonsense like that.
keep your mouth shut. and, if you love him, never do anything like that again.
and, you have someone by your side all the time.
is there a baby already pending?
money and intelligence with one. you could get the other.
two months is not a long time.  don't put it off, just break up with the guy.
my wife was my best friend, so i'm scared of games.
do not put your life on hold.
if you need to ask this question, then probably this is not the right one.
i went to my gynecologist and everything came out okay.
well yes. you should love them.
do anything except make him have sex with you.
it is possible that he may want to be friends instead of in a relationship.
there is one other thing that popped into my head.
they are in heaven. keep praying and one day you can go there and meet them.
they want what your lady friend has; you.
nothing, it is not your place to tell him.
then come up with some positive answers instead.
the average guy wants sex and a nice guy wants a caring woman to love and be with for the rest of his life.
no, you idiot, an education is better than a boy!
a friend that is a girl, is a girlfriend.
first and foremost, be polite to her. secondly, dressing well will be beneficial.
if you and your mate are comfortable, then it does not matter.
what is his favorite sports team?
take time to go out and congregate with others.
you should look for someone who loves you too.
if he is spending his free weekend time with you.
before anyone can love you, you have to find a way to love yourself.
it is caused by the way they often think with the improper head.
it is always possible for me, that is why viagra exists.
why don't you try someone who loves you, too?
before someone else can love you, you must learn to love yourself.
that is because they are thinking with their penis.
no, men are always capable, at least with a little help from viagra.
that is because women think with their brain and men think with their penis.
now, that is just common sense.
i would be thrilled to go with chris brown because he is very sexually attractive.
but i just cannot help it.
maybe the people you are calling mean merely have thoughts and perspectives that you disagree with.
move forward, and find somebody else.
let him know you find him sexually attractive and tell him you like him.
i love women with an accent.
please answer my question because i really need to know.
call me back and let me know.
it's probably a genetic characteristic of their family.
they have been friends for many years and she is not interested in a deeper relationship.
note: i would not recommend the cheaper versions, as they are unreliable.
i would be with my wife before another person, but perhaps that's just my preference.
that is the first thing he does when he arrives at home.
i am certain that the other person feels the same way.
well, there are other things that could cause a problem, as well, such as pregnancy.
then you say, "honey, did you see the ice?"
i gave up on dating bisexual women quite some time ago. they are too dramatic, in my opinion.
in doing so, she may find you interesting. please do not ask why.
if he shows you a good time and buys you nice things, then being a friend just won't do.
if he has cheated in the past, he will be a cheater in the future.
it means he does not want a girl friend at the moment. please don't over analyze the situation.
i can currently recall why i seriously dislike you.
if you love him and you want to help him, please take your feelings in consideration.
i would treat him better than his current girlfriend and have sex with him until he wants it every day.
then you're back with them for about ten minutes and remember what you were going to say.
you could possibly find someone to date on myspace or tagworld.
if they do not know now, they will when things start going bad.  i'm not talking about intuition either!
they will ask you on a date, and get upset when you turn them away.
even a telephone call does not provide assurance that they are real.
while i know some people may disagree, i state my opinions.
it depends on your age, but if he does not appear to be attracted to you he might be homosexula.
the responses you receive that appear to be answers may in fact be simply advice.
perhaps you should spend some time apart.
as when we begin to speak all baby like.
when women state no, that means no!
it's better to attempt to impress her friend.
it depends upon how much of the color you plan to wear.
he practices between 20-30 hours a week.
the reason is because i have it, however, you can't have it.
i suggest you also inquire about whey you did not love her previously.
the first reason is the most of the wealthiest reason care only about their money.
i am just telling you the realistic position.
you should inform her as soon as possible because it's best not to wait when it comes to terminating a relatinship.
you must find out everything about a person before you marry them and make a lifelong commitment.
to make her feel bad about what she did.
break up with this man and never go back to him.
if a woman told you that, usually she means no.
that is what i look for in women.
he is my significant other, and that is all i need.
i attend the same school as him, and i am avoiding him, but i do want to tell him.
that is the red light district, so make sure to bring some condoms.
it does not matter what the age difference is between you, as long as you get a long and love each other.
or it may be easier if you can actually see the person.
keep that as a desire or a fantasy.
however, is it really true love?
the people on here seem incredibly illiterate.
we are going through some of the same things.
my sister married a "momma's boy" and they have been married for over thirty-five years!
trust me if you are. what is up? the chickens will come.
the best thing about such a person is that they will be in contact with you always.
flirt with him so he gets the idea.
i think you'd have to have a foot fetish to understand. not that i do, i am just saying.
it usually drives men nuts if you find another man to get involoved with; dating, hanging out, or just socializing.
if you just want a girlfriend or sex, then move on.
i think 16 is a good age to start.
it depends on how he physically he feels in his mind.
does he really ever make you happy?
so, yes, i believe they can last!
try to avoid gaining weight.
can you afford the tax for the cd?
some women fall in love with, and marry men ten years older than themselves.
what is the estimated price?
if you wanted your freedom, why did you get married?
also, try not to be fat.
a cd; come on. you can scrape up tax, right?
some girls marry and love boys that are 10 years older than themselves.
approximately what am i looking at here in price?

if it's a guy resembles you, good for you.

a nice, loving guy, that loves you for who you are.
you are only a kid once in your life.
you should kiss your guy when you think it is the right time.

which do you think is worse?
in addition, the first one is going to be the fastest.

no matter what is occurring,  she is usally too busy and tired.
i like to think that i am the ruler over all that is ours.
1. what do you look for in a relationship?
maybe you need to spice it up.
i know from experience that i become stupid when i talk with girls i like.
maybe the hair would not have been so bad without the make-up.
i do not think it is right, but it is the truth.
is it only me, or is her answer telling you that it is alright?
remember what is good about you; keep yourself busy and give yourself time and stay strong.
it is both a film and a story.
then go back to being funny, stern and enigmatic.
when you're married, you won't have to worry about that.
please give me another opportunity.
much goes to waste daily.
we all pretend to be that way to be polite.
whatever you do, please don't shout!
even most girls would like a moderate amount of shyness for their guys.
my honest and straight forward answer is a resounding no!
if they are not faithful to their own spouse, the way you are, then how long until they will cheat on me?
that is the best way to release emotions.
i was incredibly patient and eventually i was rewarded by finding the love of my life.
if there is sex involved, then he will only want that from you.
it is not your fault, it is the fact that he does not think clearly.
i would play both of them, because they are both more attractive than anyone else.
all you have to do is smile at him and say hello to him now and again and it will confuse him.
i know all about it because i am a man, believe me.
no, because down there they would not be able to get an internet connection.
if you both love to ski, then go to the ski hill or some place like that.
you might buy her some chocolate.
do not use any worn out pick-up lines on them.
i have been seeing my girlfriend so life is busy.
was not john hinkley obsessed with jodi foster?
no, if you must know i am not cheating.
your child now has their own family so you are free now to choose for yourself.
tell her that you are an axe murderer.
it is the one you get from someone you love.
creating space between the two of you doesn't have to mean that he's bored with you.
please be confident and tell him the truth.
we love witnessing public displays of affection.
it can be difficult for some mailes to go from casual dating to entering a monogamous relationship.
some people are mean for no specfic reason. i'm nice, however, i can also be feisty.
it may not be that he finds you boring, he may just need a little space.
keep your head up and tell him the truth.
you should try leaving hickies, we really enjoy that.
some men have a difficult time with the transition between casual dating and being in a committed relationship.
some people are cruel because they are bored, i am a kind person but i do have a bite.
the final point is that love means placing their happiness above your own even if it means that you're not together.
it occurred over a man i felt she should not be dating.
i love my family very much.
i would not expect that most guys would have a preference in that regard.
you can discuss things that they like and if it is a girl you can start dating.
how about just a half day?
unless your job is respectful. it is good to have a spouse. it's your choice.
when you are ready. it's all about time.
and, no, i do not work for them!
best way to attract the ladies.
write them a letter, and then put the letter into their locker.
get in bed, and then stick his penis into your vagina in order to lose your virginity.
if a man only wants to be your friend then it is a sign that you are ugly.
any kind of intimacy or even the desire to experience intimacy together.
best of luck, and have a good time.
you are thinking about love, and love is thinking about you.
follow nike's motto, "just do it!".
i call it the "i love you if".
"how and what way" is stereo-type used for and with "love? what?".
make it unforgettable; i used a big bag of rose petals.
is this woman someone with whom you work with?
think deeply, because this is a good one.
because, i desire them to be.
the first time we went out on a date i had already decided to take her to my bedroom and lay her beside myself.
yes, he is ten years old, let him be a kid. let him believe what he wants to believe.
no, not if you do not desire to have sex.
every time you go home with new pornography you will be more excited than you ever have.
i am sorry, but they are all homosexual.
women do not want to die, but men only care about having sex.
well she did, which is not my problem because he does not like her anymore.
it does not matter if you are homosexual, just as long as you have someone to love and someone that loves you.
yes sir, you are mistaken.
someone persistently asking you to have intercourse with them is not a vaild reason to do so, especially if you are in a committed relationship.
i am apprehensive about this type of relationship because you need to meet someone to truly know who they are.
ask him what kind of things he enjoys doing and pick something together that you both would enjoy.
boy, boy, or girl, girl, whatever. just someone to love, and to love you and "circle the wagons" with.
yes sir, your're barking on the wrong tree.
begging is definitely not a good reason to sleep with anyone, especially when you're seeing someone.
i don't believe completely with this kind of love because meeting makes each other truly clear and faithful.
well, ask him what he would like to do. pick something together that both of you would enjoy.
most of the girls don't like their boys at all.
i have no idea and would like to ask the same question.
having lust in your heart is the same as cheating.
your friends will move away from you but your lover probably will not.
if you are not sure then just ask what her desires are.
primarily, you are not writing to your friends or they are not writing to you.
it is easier to get younger females to be intimate with them.
you are too old to have your first date.
maybe he will ask you out.
when you are out of answers, you should discuss her likes with her.
in the first place, you need to write your friends
it is often easier to engage younger women into intercourse.
you are really far too mature to be going on your first date.
it is possible that he may ask you on a ate.
fourteen to seventeen. you men are cowards, coitus before marriage is not a big deal.
because that is their natural answer.
if not, then you only wasted a small amount of time.
begin slowly and passionately, then do it hard but gently.
couple's therapy, though it sounds strange, it does help.
during teenage years, men believe they are bad boys for having sex before marriage.
they say that because it is in their nature.
if it turns out to not be true, then you have wasted nothing but a bit of time.
the first time should be slow and full of passion, follow that up with something a bit more active but still careful.
i know this sounds cliche, but couples therapy really can help a relationship.
i feel like i love my guy but i do not feel madly in love with him.
lay naked on your bed with a rose in your teeth.
i have read in a magazine that funny people think faster most of the time.
i mean no offense to that girl.
it might mean she really like the ankle bracelet.  men are jealous creatures.
how do i pick up a girl at work?
let me know how that turns out for you.
i've heard that many men have got to have it, yet not all men are that way.
girl, tell someone before they get hurt.
i know he will never change because i haven't and my wife and i experienced the same thing.
how can i ask out a woman i work with?
keep me informed on the results of this.
while not all men are the same, some do require it.
you should inform the proper authorities before someone gets hurt.
i went through the same thing with my wife, he won't change.
heck, i like a guy with good teeth.
just don't go solo, it makes the girls mad.
why would he stay in just because you got mad?
i did, and i've been deliriously happy for over five years now. just follow your heart.
i married someone i met online.
goodness, i like a guy that has nice teeth.
please do not go by yourself, as it upsets the grrrs.
then why would he stay home because you were angry?
i did and i have been deliriously happy for more than five years.  simply follow your heart.
i married a person i met online.
most likely you're attracted to your choir director.
your boyfriend has to worry about both sexes hitting on you.
i'm sixteen, i believe it's a great age to begin.
i wouldn't date someone with a four year difference, because i'm fifthteen.
think about of having a child of your own one day.
so, that is when greed comes.
almost all relationships start because of lust; people are drawn to physical appearance before they decide to continue on anything else.
just like when you know you are in love, you know when you or the one you love is not.
i did not know that the color green was associated with sex; i always thought it would be the color red.
he swears that nothing happened, but i mean, come on! it is a sex drug.
high school can difficult because some students can be mean.
one beautiful woman is good, two beautiful women is great.
she is too young, where are her parents.
follow your dream.
josie, no matter how hard you try to make things right, he will never change; my boyfriend is just as difficult.
high school is a confusing time, often times students are cruel to each other.
if one attractive woman is a good thing then doubling it would be much better.
she is too young for that, where are her parents?
you should follow what your heart says.
josie, i experienced the same thing in a previous relationship, he will never change.
sometimes women act loud, to get attention from the male they're attracted to.
i believe with homosexual sex, it wouldn't work.
if it would be more of an advantage for yourself, why won't it work?
that was the ex girlfriend i found in bed with another woman.
it depends upon the character of the girl.
in my opinion, my friend has a horrible boyfriend.
that should not stop you from enjoying it.
what women say means something different to women and to men.
as a male, i must say.
when you said you did not want a glimpse anymore, it means you made yourself a challenge to her.
please, do not commit adultery when you are in a relationship with that man.
i am extremely self-centered.
if necessary, do not wear clothes.
walking is how people usually approach anything.
you said that you are good looking, which is a benefit for meeting new people.
believe me, they aren't.
women are able to manipulate to obtain items.
life is what you make of it, regardless of age.
the only thing cheating solves is lust, temporarily.
its time could come any moment, so i am waiting.
take a break from both of them; who will you miss more?
i don't think of anyone else when i am out with my date.
i suppose i could be falsifying it.
i am not convinced you are in love with either of them.
you should trust your intuition.  it is obvious that you are having second thoughts.
it is too bad that he is not considerate and respectful of that matter.
you get a feeling in your heart.
converse and discuss problems with your significant male other about every thing.
responses from females and women would be beneficial.
if you are having doubts, you should listen to them.
if he cannot find a way to respect the wishes, that will be a problem.
you will feel it with your heart.
you should communicate with your partner about everything.
input from women would be helpful.
no, i don't believe it's wrong to love.
i would not commit adultery against my wife if you threatened my life.
you have to let time pass.
try asking her once, and if she doesn't give you and answer then stop trying.
this is proof you do not really love your significant other.
there is too many different kinds of religions.
do not dwell on it and it wont be an issue.
face it, you do not have a marriage.
friendship is telling the truth to you when others wont, listening, and not judging.
i still bleed after sex, but at least i know there is nothing wrong.
are you pregnant, or is he being mean?
intelligence can make you attractive.
three words to pronounce; do you not speak english?
where should i go from here?
why do you not get a divorce and save the poor woman?
do rockstars love drugs and strippers?
this hast to do with knowledge, not maturity.
i recommend you cut off your relationship with him.
because you are a stranger to her.
no they don't, and they don't read ladder theory.
many men are obnoxious because they are insecure.
give him time to mature.
don't share that information with her, if you do she may change her behavior.
always remember that what does not kill you will make you stronger.
either way, i wish you all the luck in the world.
i would have to say that both are important, women like to be happy and the size is always important.
just because they are quiet around you doesn't mean they are bored in your company.
you should keep it a secret, if you tel lher she may being to act in a different manner.
what does not kill you make you stronger.
best of luck to you.
silence does not always indicated that the person is bored.
that does not mean i can say what is going on with your husband.
so i ask you to please listen to your heart.
based on that, you should know what to do.
here is a clue about what your next step needs to be!
that is not true if you really love him.
i am heterosexual but some of my friends are not.
for the time being, i do not want children at all.
start by telling her your name and letting her know that you think she is lovely.
yes, he is far too old for you.
i feel it is to everyone's own preference.
i am heterosexual but i do have homosexual friends.
currently, i a do not want any children.
the best way to start is by complimenting her and telling her your name.
i believe he is to old for you.
everyone is entitled to doing things their own way.
when it comes to the guy, you should take your time.
the familiar scenario of having sex and leaving them.
the answer can be found if you look deep within your heart.
if you are interested in getting ideas, we can discuss that.
if a man says he ended an affair, it doesn't always mean that it is really over.
wait for the guy.
i am going to be honest and forthright.
it seems like neither you nor your partner are quite ready for marriage yet.
if you question him about his behavior, he may not even realize there is something inappropriate about it.
i would do so, because this might halt his undesirable behavior.
my grandfather was the last good man i knew.
i don't understand what you meant by, "will i get him?".
it doesn't mean it will be easy.
question him about his objectives.
i needed to concentrate to continue.
in that case, maybe you should obtain a foreign boyfriend.
it is all about the mind, and if you do not connect that way first then all you are having is sex.
try using a chat room called "chat philipines".
you should stay pure until you get married.
they are beautiful, sexy, and a lot of fun to be around.
i guess you like her and want her to like you in return, so good luck.
i suggest you follow his desires while in the bed.
do what makes you happy.
kind individuals are no longer available.
a small number are positive and a small number are negative.
if you would like to be successful you will need to be intelligent.
find out if he's interested, then ask him.
i am also scared.
what makes them unique is their tactics.
act properly, enjoy the moment.
say hello, then introduce yourself, then attempt to make conversation.
just be yourself. the first thing that you need to realize is that you are a special person.
okay, well a good thing to do to turn him on is to rub his ear.
in my opinion, if you are attracted to her, then try to get her attention.
it is obvious that he only wants to have sexual relations with you.
i do not at all the majority of the time.
not all guys are only after having sex; there are some really nice men as well.
i only want to be friends with you, and nothing more than that.
so if that is what you prefer then you should do that.
basically, one way to tell is if you are flirting with this guy and do not realize it.
some women do, and some men enjoy it, as well.
well married women should not have a boyfriend's body to make remarks about.
in the future, he may show signs that it is possible.
one sure clue is when you discover you have been flirting with a man and you weren't even aware you were doing it.
women often do, and sometimes men enjoy it as well.
if a woman is married, she should not make comments about a boyfriends body.
a peer, a committed partner, and a sexual member.
try considering when you are attracted physically to a girl whether you will like her or not.
first, you need to wait if you are just considering it because it is what he wants.
i suggest you tell your man first so that he stays away from that woman.
whatever else you do, do not say what you do not mean.
throw her a surprise party to welcome her back!
it is certainly unnatural, but i would encourage homosexuality.
the odds are that you can do better for less.
if you are unhappy with a person, just leave.  there is no reason to cheat.
i have feelings for a girl who is more popular than i am.
find your personal preference - shemales, bisexual relationships - whatever brings you pleasure.
i guess she is attractive, too, like you.
in the past, i thought all men were unpleasant, but apparently it was just the area i lived in.
try to look at the situation from every angle.
tell your ex-boyfriend to leave.
age is not significantly important.
what if you are caught in the act?
people who truly care about others will give them space and time to themselves.
i know a young lady who was given a rifle rather than a promise ring and she was thankful for it.
he is simply not interested in pursuing you.
there are too many "bad boys" out there.
i am single and attractive, but i am a tad bit shy at first.
for me, it would be my wife.
i had one year in college studying computer graphic arts before i got married.
i must side with getrd2go's statement above: a married woman with a boyfriend?
don't make any plans, just be punctual on the wedding day. best of luck to you!
don't let other people determine who you friends are, or aren't.
this is not having sex, but your boyfriend may enjoy it enough to stay.
and how can one be obtained?
because they want their date to get to know their siblings.
once i realized this, my next relationship really worked because i did not need it, i wanted it.
if he has changed or is willing to change, then try counseling.
if all else fails, use your hands!
i love ll cool j's lips.
to this day, she is still talking about me.
it is because you love or care too much.
no, because once you get married, you do not have sex anymore.
you must do what feels right to you.
it will probably ruin your friendship, but at least she is experienced.
i would like some thoughts on how best to propose to her.
since i am a lesbian, i often socialize with gay men. i can tell you honestly, they are not all attractive.
she should know it is seen as homosexual and annoying.
older women prefer nice men, and younger women are drawn to obnoxious men.
keep looking for new and interesting opportunities!
if you are considering cheating, check that you care as much as you feel you do.
then maybe you will find a sex partner.
do you have homosexual chat rooms for teenagers?
and do not lead her on afterward.
she is going to feel very down on her self, like a worthless thing.
i conveyed everything to her, clearly, her reply was that she would "think", on it.
this is due to the fact most people make the mistake of speaking quickly before they think, just blurting things out.
i would like to know when men will stop acting as such...
all this said, have fun looking for the right kind of woman you seek out.
the 'god spot' is missing in the lives of many people.
he is dealing with more issues than you understand. you can't solve his problems, it is better not to try.
i wanted to find out if anyone else is in love.
boyfriends and girlfriends do things together that other friends don't, so they form special bonds.
well, i suppose it is because god created you that way.
try not smelling so much like a guy.
when you see him, give him some love, if you know what i mean.
do not break up with him but do not call him either.
female chimpanzees do not experience orgasm.
i would like to have sex with you.
i delivered a child six months ago.
it's for the simple reason that men love women.
you never stated that you had everything, and he had nothing.
is there any real good answer?
it's not as if he going to leave anywhere soon.
my husband and i watch adult movies together.
men are a bit less than respectable.
after three months, is he serious?
if you hear these unfortunate words, immediately back off.
he came and spoke to me in both of my dreams.
we sometimes do and sometimes don't have feelings for them. most of our friends are men.
i am a man and i can say honestly that i find pornography disgusting.
i believe this is true. for me it is, and i believe it is for many women.
if you love them, then talk about it, and ask. however, don't expect too much.
take your time and do not do the pornographic tongue flick.
he is basically saying that it is tough being me.
perhaps your best friend found a very insecure girl hoping for a jell-o pitted cat fight!
you are very attentive tonight, is sex the only thing you think about?
once she and i broke up, i knew a lot of other bi-sexual and gay women.
i did not enjoy having my heart broken.
run, wave your hands, and scream at the same time.
no gentleman wants a loose woman.
apologize to him and relay that you though he was supposed to call you.
i am well read, but not handsome.
do you find yourself more attracted to women than men?
the ones who do that are subhuman.
one should learn from his mistakes and not hurt his girlfriend.
it is always nice to enjoy a spa day.
it is a place where people who want to be gangsters and rappers hang out.
do you think that she would leave her husband?
just close your eyes and try it.
send him this text message, "honey, my phone died, but my love for you never will".
a necklace that has a heart charm on it.
next time you look for your future wife, be safe and be yourself.
support your friend by hanging out with them even if you do not care for them.
let yvan tell him.
they can use a timer.
give her nice compliments.
but there are guys, and they are usually very attractive.
whomever said "yes" is very wrong, that is not right.
yes, heck i have fallen in love every other night with a lot of female movie stars.
her sentences are starting to sound she uses the word "ahhness" as every other word she says.
do not worry, she will understand and if she is she will open up to you.
they will follow your wife and find out if she is cheating on you or not.
yes, if they really have true love.
didn't i tell you i took them all and turned them into lesbians>
yes, but it will hurt you, so pick one.
once i knew for certain, i told him and he proposed.
if you had so much fun, i do not think he lost interest, especially since he is still calling you.
would you say that you are still attracted to him and like him?
keep the policy of "do not ask/do not tell".
the best thing would be to ask about what is wrong.
perhaps what you desire most is what you do not have.
christmas is not about giving and receiving gifts.
if that does not work then he is immature.
he wants to marry me even though he does not even notice me and i wonder why.
i have heard that losing virginity is not enjoyable.
simply ask her, "will you go to the movie theater with me tonight?" it is quite simple to do.
my daughter still speaks of how he treated me.
it may seem mean, however she deservs it if she is committing infidelity.
you need to decide who is more important. is it your boyfriend or your friend/roommate?
men either do or they do not.
she is not telling you something that might harm you.
one day i will leave you.
if they do not mind, why should you?
i think it is ugly and disgusting.
she did not catch it until recently because her disreputable partner has been having unprotected sex.
everyone has their own way of doing things.
the best way a man invited me to go on a date was so innocent; he just asked.
gay men are more into things girls like, such as shopping, decorating, accessorizing, etcetera.
you can always learn more about them, then do things they like.
ask him to spend time with you, then be nice to him, maybe give him a gift.
normally it makes things worse if you beat, please don't do it.
it could be because you spend too much time with strangers on yahoo rather than meeting people in real life.
i have a lot of great friends.
he knows he is not the father.
the brain is a woman's most erogenous zone.
she is the only one who knows what is going on, so you need to talk to her.
because they are afraid of their own sexuality.
do not say that they really do make her look fat.
intelligence matters because laughter can only get you so far.
however, do not kill her; that is not a good idea.
find out how old he/she is.
she acts proper, but she gives good sex.
do you want to date this girl?
what do you do on a date?
if you love him, don't mess up his house.
my friend, please do not give her a poem.
you should care, however if she truly loves you, she would not let you go.
i could not imagine not being married, however everyboy imagines life differently.
i wish you good luck with the great danes.
i enjoys hobbies that males typically like, such as skateboarding and playing in a band. i even play the drums.
i do not know, but if you do find out, let me know.
i am indecisive.
i would not give it to her.
why would any woman want that?
the way you are speaking if offensive.
please complete the task as many times as possible.
i want to call my mother to share some exciting news.
you can choose your own path in life.
we have decided to go with someone more qualified.
you are not only fooling the others, but most importantly, you are fooling yourself.
it would depend on what requires lubrication; ky is best for sex and wd40 is best for other lubrication uses.
will i allow you to go deeper?
in addition, women have many more horomones than men.
but she just broke up with me this past year, and i do not understand why.
ask her on a date.
how do i deal with this?
by the way, i am not saying art students are not decent.
before i was 19, i lost my virginity to my wife.
you need to ask yourself, "can i deal with this for the rest of my life?"
yes, it would depend on who the man and them woman are.
do not start the conversation by saying that you want a divorce, that word can be considered to be hostile.
if one of the men did not work out for me, then i always had the other one to fall back on.
so, you need to wait on another one who has the same dream as you do.
there is another man who says that he loves me and will ask me out on a date.
we had only learned of men who wanted to be married to more than one woman.
pay her, and then return to your home with your wife.
does he have drool dripping out of his mouth when he stares?
a dinner at her favorite place.
try acting like you are sexy, and then you will be sexy.
maybe he wants you to ask him out.
it would be alright for barbie!
then use that answer to base your next bit of chat on.
you could ask her, or catch her in the crime.
it was a very funny dream.
perhaps he wants you to ask him on a date.
barbie would accept it.
you can question her or wait until she breaks the law.
the dream was hilarious.
i could have gone the rest of my life without seeing her again.
i think it will work if you get him a box of condoms and say, "let's do it sexy."
i hope this works, and can you tell me afterwards if it does or doesn't?
i was asked out by a man yesterday, and i said yes.
i would like to have sex with you.
how do i end the relationship with the other guy without hurting his feelings?
yes, i hope you will have a happy new year.
bring a case against him in small claims court.
if it is big, should i just try?
i hope your wife will read this online.
if she refuses to put her signature on it, then tell her to leave.
i would just break up with her because what she did was wrong.
but, does not know that i am dating someone else.
it would be better if swingers were the only one to respond to this question.
it is difficult to find the perfect person, male or female.
you have to let things go every so often.
begging for female companions on the internet makes you look pathetic.
if you knew this man you would not let him move in with you.
sounds to me that you are in a casual relationship.
good looking people can have ugly personalities.
you might enjoy it as well if you give it a chance.
do women use this to enlarge their breasts?
we are in a strong and dedicated relationship, but we participate in swinging as well.
they shot you down.
i have never kissed a man.
pigs are the only other animals that enjoy having sex for pleasure only.
speak highly about he or she.
hopefully i am incorrect, but i dont' believe i am.
make sure about that before you start digging.
can you see if your male friends have friends that are also single?
go out there and do your best!  he will be there waiting for you!  good luck!
i was curious and agree with your responses.
when you determine the answer, please send me one.
if you don't solve the problem it will come to your.
feel free to engage in the activity whenever you like.
you should remember to be a gentleman because chivalry is not dead as yet.
i think that dating older guys should not be an issue.
sometimes, you get lucky and someone tells.
try asking yourself if you love men.
you get to know him and you learn everything about him.
i can not stand to look at my reflection.
i believe you meant a long term relationship, and if so, then when your casual relationship matures into a full relationship, then you should know.
women: do you, or would you, and why or why not?
if she enjoyed it or wanted it as much as you do, then yes, it will only help you.
ask him, and then come onto him first.
that is my opinion anyway.
i promise you that they are out there.
how about saying, "hey, i need more sex!"
you have to turn them on first, then everything will be turned on.
if anything is wrong, you can always turn it into a joke.
to find out what a guy is thinking, look in his eyes to try and read them, or his heart if you know him well.
if not, then your first time should not be bad.
best of luck, sincerely, ice princess. ps:
a straight female, open-minded, a mother, sexually active, and intelligent!
he wants you for sex and nothing else.
i would like to have sex with you.
hello, did you happened to view ________ on television last night?
you may need more practice if you are still confused.
i am looking for a man that is going to...
they wished to see her full lip on or around there!
we both had possessions that the other did not.
he always leaves without telling her that he is leaving.
do not expect to fall in love in 10 days unless you meet your perfect match.
or just ask him to be up front with you.
there must be a reason that you broke up in the first place, right?
if she has feelings for you, then what are you waiting for?
women do not see 38 year old me as old.
if they want to see you, then do it.
it is not a big deal.
maybe she likes you a little too much?
it'll be difficult, but leave.
it's not a good way to find love, with other men's girlfriends.
he would call me next, and so forth.
i love him, i want to marry him. i don't want my family to disown me.
stay off that terrible drug!
be confident, but not self absorbed.
it sounds as if they're busy with their own lives.
i'm not sure what i should say.
the majority of us are quite similar.
your wife will be speechless.
if you are bad at conversating then you don't have to talk much with others.
my wife did the same thing.
they say it doesn't matter but it does!
she desires romance, charm, wit, humor, and you must be physically attractive.
she states her desire to engage in sexual acts with you.
i am aware of heterosexual people who have also had them.
however, the common sentiment of "love is lovelier the second time around" expresses truth.
you are returning due to ease and comfort, therefore you must stop returning to your comfort zone and experience more of life.
she wants romance, charm, wit, comedy. you also have to be good looking!
she says, "i want to have sex with you."
and, i know all of "state" people who have had them too.
but, there is a saying, "love is lovelier the second time around," and it's true.
cut the security blanket, and move on. you are only coming back because it's easy to do so.
inform them that it's not working out, it's better to be friends.
let him go, search for a good man.
by now, you should be in a different spot in your relationship.
i have many men friends.
do you plan to try to stop loving her?
they were in a formal relationship prior, he cannot just forget about her.
you should not say things like "you seem like a nice guy" as this will only encourage him.
she is setting the pace.
although some men are different, i can only speak for myself.
remeber that police officers cannot be there all the time, every day to protect you.
by the way, nosey family, welcome to the outlaws; i mean in-laws.
because if you get married he will just hide it, not stop.
so, such as a horse penis transplant.
a naughty girl in the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, stairs, hall, living room and in the evening.
what if you do and then he turns out to not be who you expected for him to be?
a leopard cannot change it's spot.
give her time. when she is comfortable, she will do it.
what you are tangled in does not feel good, does it?
maybe you should call to set up the appointment.
that is there so you are aware of what to scream.
what if you do all the little things and she still does not come around?
yes, i would be upset because you do not like to share a guy with another girl.
i know he cheats on her because he and my boyfriend always talk about it around me.
you love someone, and you want to show that you love him so much.
i would not do it if i were you.
typically, the male species does not care.
i am not shallow.
tell them that it is not nice what they did.
it is unappealing.
you are old enough to determine if you love this person.
i dated someone at work and it was awkward.
you do not know until you ask.
when you are doubtful, take it out.
some women think it is disgusting. however, if i was your partner...
because you are more put-together and clean looking.
show her what she is missing.
i apologize for giving you herpes is an excellent start.
if he has a girl, you should let it go.
however, there are some good men out there.
that is what happened to me.
your co-worker... one who is up to date as much as you are.
well honestly, i think you should be 15.
yes, but only pictures of my boyfriend.
if the baby's father does not like you or the baby then do not marry him, if you do you will regret it later.
if you can answer these three questions, then yes; otherwise try to strengthen your relationship with her.
they do not want a free ticket to the usa.
if they never call back, that probably means that they are not very interested.
if he is playing you, he will stay with her and keep leading you on.
if you do not believe me, talk to a mind expert.
you just feel that you are in love, but you do not really know.
i was not really looking for someone, i just made myself available.  that is how i met my wife.
you will be compensated for taking a vacation somewhere nice and romantic.
yes, i am in love, and i will be forever.
i do not have any mirrors in my bathroom, bedroom, or anywhere else.
take her to see a movie if that is what she desires.
gay male friends are important to have, since they can tell you certain things about you that a straight woman would not.
she is everything i desire. i do not want more or less of her.
a post nuptial is something you do after you are married.
i hear it is only twenty dollars to have your wedding at the local shotgun pete's.
if you ignore him once in a while he might re-evaluate his decision.
i do not think a woman would date a gay man.
men frequently compare themselves to each other.
give her a banana and ask her what she thinks of when she eats it.
a best friend feels like having a sister.
she will be very attached to you.
it is okay for you to ask him out.
virgins perform oral sex on men.
if he is not trustworthy, tell him so he can understand and accept your decision.
a best friend is like a sister.
she will be all over you, like odor on feces.
also, you could ask him out. it's okay to do that now!
even the virgins go down on guys.
if you really can't trust him, just tell him. he should understand and accept your decision.
you deserve someone new
men say they shower all the time.
we do not always use our mind to think.
is she just a trophy wife?
how do i give a gift for my husband of seven years?
you must only do that if it is what she desires as well.
it is because we can only deal with so much, and then there is nothing left to do but leave.
i have feelings for kim chee and ka go ge.
do not worry, because destiny has a plan and that plan will lead you to the right person at the best time.
love will find a way only if you do not let anything come in the way of it.
i am going to watch "monty python and the holy grail."
well, i do not think all women do, but i guess most of them do.
and he needs to tell her that he finds her sexually attractive.
second, do you feel like you two have known each other forever?
if that is what she has done before, then walk away and do not look back.
not ever man acts like a child.
he will be more honest with you than he has with other girls.
we like each other but we aren't interested in a relationship. we do enjoy having sex regularily.
your heart will lead you in the right direction.
i love him and i've felt like this from the start, but i don't know what to do. can you help?
but, not all men act like babies.
he will tell you things he normally does not tell other girls.
we like eachother, but we cannot go on. but, we are interested in our sex.
you'll know in your hear if it feels right.
i feel that from one year. please tell me what to do because i love him so much.
yes, i am in love with a loving man who sometimes acts goofy but who always keeps me smiling!
it does not matter whether the woman admits to liking you or not.
enjoy being single and do not worry about finding the right one as there are probably more than one.
my list is simple but it is composed of the things i like to discuss.
that is because you are all so good at it.
i do not think that he would ever be able to use it.
never settle for anything and always believe that tomorrow is another day!
for a relationship to work well, you need to be honest.
come on, you can do better than that.
be warned; do not try to fake an interest.
as the other member stated previously, she's not.
you should wear it around the base snugly.
i have a male friend, with a girlfriend with issues.
you shouldn't force her to do anything.
we both have careers, she's in her twenties, i'm in my thirties.
if you do not look for him, he will come to you.
do not take this literally because this is only my opinion.
move on with your life, be friends, and do not push him for anything more serious.
sometimes you are so big that it hurts and other times it's the opposite situation.
how it works is if you are very good looking, she will be the one to chase you.
she is probably playing hard to get.
that's because people are quite dense and in love.
so you allowed him to do watever he wanted.
if a girl such as her proposed to me i would not have discussed it with anyone.
if you two have been together for that period of time mother probably knows.
there are plenty of fish in the sea.
homosexual men are similar to women, in that they both are attracted to men. no offense meant.
i'm a woman that's been in love with my boyfriend for three years.
i'm unsure if i see it differently.
a pet, child, and relationship were three things most important to me.
things could have been worse if you chose not to fight.
most of my friends are male because i don't get along with females.
will they listen to their teachers the same way they listen to you?
i don't decisions i make now to have an effect later on.
love is the ability to read excerpts like this one and then finally understanding the meaning of the material.
skinny is not attractive to me, but if a person is too thick then that is not attractive for me either.
here is the thing: when men desire you, they will be sure that you know it.
i suppose it is not the best of places for a third world citizen like me.
maybe, you tell the person that you have strong feelings for them.
it worked when i allowed a man to do it to me.
men trade emotional attachment for sexual favors.
why can you not have a fresh start on a new life?
and you do not believe your question is ridiculous?
there may be many reasons why my father does not come home as often.
you should move on to another woman.
you should speak with him. my boyfriend and i conversate constantly.
if you're with three currently, why not continue?
if you need to ask if you're in love, then you're not.
if you attempt to meet up with him. definitely bring friends.
hello, i am a forty-six-year-old male who is five feet and eight inches tall.
that is the most stupid question i have ever heard.
it is only because of the thinking, nothing else.
because your friend is smarter than you.
it sounds to me like he is trying to control you bit too much.
if you do not want to do it, then don't bother.
i am used to it by now.
it turns them on, as they are human beings.
you never know if the guy may be lying.
i cannot believe that girls can be this skeptical.
sir, it might be two things.
for a girl, it is natural.
what a coincidence, i just dealt with that !
resisting temptation is hard. why fight it ? people say that the best way to resist temptation is to give in to it.
i replied that i was not dating anyone, when he questioned me.
i believe no strings attached is the best policy. you may do as you like.
perhaps she's viewed you ogling at women?
otherwise, you might have already known he had been with her at the same time as with you.
as long as you continue to gather numbers, you're doing well.
how can he not have time to see you, if he's not currently working?
i work with men mainly.
in addition to being extremely wealthy.
whether she is clothed or not, always reassure her she is beautiful.
similar to school with tv's to watch games.
thank you for your responses.
yes, we love it, especially if it is the person whim we have affections for who rubs us.
i am positive that she will love it.
we will have been dating each other for at least six months on christmas day.
i am married and i have had this problem before.
let us see, can women?
i believe you meant obsessed, correct?
some of them both won't hurt.
you should inform your mother.
i was with my paramour.
did i mention how close we're both becoming?
just as men are not, women are not mindreaders either.
on average, once or twice a week is when most people have it.
he would be understanding because he is your best friend.
i believe the only anser is the best answer.
if she appreciates art, then take her to a museum or gallery.
nobody belongs to anybody until he or she is married.
that is my advice, and i hope it helps.
port is considered a relationship breaker and will not help.
one unfaithful, always unfaithful.
you just have not earned it yet dear.
yes, some women do not like it.
i need that sexy advice to help me through many problems that may occur in my life.
do not always dress like a guy.
it is good that you have high self-esteem.
you must demonstate to her that you care.
i estimate that i found him a minimum of five times.
in the first instance, what do you assess your probability of success.
there are many available men with good qualities, and you need not tolerate this sort of behavior.
i will you a speedy recovery, c. fluellen.
you have got to show her that you care.
i would bet that i found him at least five times.
well, first of all, what are your chances?
there a lot of great guys out there; you do not need to put up with this type of behavior.
i pray that you get well c. fluellen.
discipline them. take privilages away. don't let them walk all over you.
it feels so great, but sometimes it hurts a lot.
he won't kiss me, even though it's been almost a year since we started dating.
with her favorite flowers waiting. or, a friendship ring with something personal engraved in it.
the best adjective you could come up with would be "adulterer."
disicpline.  remove their privileges.  do not let them take advantage of you.
it feels wonderful but occasionally it can be quite painful.
he refuses to kiss me, although it has been a year since we began our courtship.
with her favorite flowers in wait, or a friendship ring with a personal note engraved upon it.
the best you could think up would be "adulterer".
if you were my girlfriend, i would be worried!
your father doesn't like him so there will be not future with him.
it is good if you appreciate it, bad if you enjoy the earthly smelly look.
quite honorable, but one would have to wonder when the red flag would pop up.
what has been done cannot be undone, it is better to not play with fire.
should i notify her or leave it in the past?
unfortunately, i had either become too attached or slept with them, it's been unpleasant.
some people have it coming to them.
do men consider sexual realtions that much more often than women do?
i would inform her as soon as possible.
to ease your mind, you need to speak with her.
she may be receptive if you try speaking with her.
i apologize in advance for being so straight forward, but do women not like that?
even more so if she is out with her peers having a good time.
i apologize for our cultural differences, i didn't mean to offend you.
what if he were to leave his wife and family for you?
when he asks you to marry him like you were saying, ask him where the ring is.
if not, and they are not going to marry you, then no.
perhaps you should just let him smoke weed.
i can not find my puppy; could you help me find him?
they are a hot geek, but a nerd has no confidence, therefore, no can do!
he is not only a creep, but he is stupid too.
he really loves his girlfriend, so i don't want to mess that up. but, what am i to do?
if it's "a," then forget it, she's psychotic once again.
a diamond ring will make a girl appreciate you after you made her mad.
he's attractive for a geek but that type lacks confidence so i'm not interested.
he's not only a creep but he isn't very smart as well.
he really loves his girlfriend so i don't want to interfere but what can i do?
if you have made a girl angry giving her a diamond ring will make her appreciate you.
the place you need to reach, is one where flaws no longer concern you.
you should know, that you have a friend in the united states.
he was not aware it was me, until i told him it was.
you need to move on with your life, unless there is no where for your children and you to go, save being out on the streets.
it is funny, it actually used to be public, but is no longer.
it's nice when they wear them on their rear-end only, not on their head.
do not be in a hurry to settle down.
thank god for brave women like us.
carry her books, compliment her shoes (girls love that), and be sensitive.
comfort them instead of anoying them or driving them crazy like last time.
you will risk your friendship with her, your relationship with your boyfriend, and your friend's relationship.
austin, texas should be a good place.
to be honest, it is somewhat depressing; thank you, i feel pretty bad now.
i am weird in this, but i think "hey, it is my two cents".
i see no problem with braces; they do not turn me off at all.
of course, it depends on the girl.
this question is for men; does your girlfriend or wife watch adult movies? do you want this to happen?  why do you want this to happen?
they start at about 10 dollars.
a) flirting, proving to himself that he is still desirable.
i am a gothy/punk girl, so i personally would not be caught like that.
first, go on-line in chat rooms, then you can meet her in person.
he wants to raise the baby as it was his own child.
you really love this person, but you live with your parents and do not want to anger them.
as her why she behaves as she does.
please give me advice on how i can move on from him.
but, i know someone back in my country.
it's been miserable, but i stayed because i thought i had to.
tell your parents that he's a friend.
if you wouldn't do it, then she shouldn't do it.
then, think for what it is?
but, i know a person who still lives in my home country.
it has been miserable, but i stayed because i thought i had to.
tell your parents he is a friend.
if you would not do it, then she should not do it either.
then what do you think it is?
i prefer well built, nice biceps.
girls love that, and more. appreciate the directness.
i wear thongs, and i was wondering if a lot of guys like ladies wearing them?
if she flirts with you, she likes you. if she gets mad at you for anything, she does not.
so, your opening chat should be about people; you and yours, her and hers, them and theirs.
i like a well-developed body with nice biceps.
women like men who are more direct.
i wonder if guys like women who wear thongs because i wear them.
if she flirts with you, she likes you, but if she gets angry for nothing, she doesn't.
because, that is what women are for.
she found herself someone gullible and he will soon be unable to meet her needs, even if ten years go by.
next time you see him, perhaps wear a very short skirt with no underwear.
this leads me to the main problem i have seen with my sci-fi male friends, they do not actually talk to women.
hetfield said, "it does not feel good until it hurts. carpe' deim".
if it is someone who already loves you, however, i don't think that it will matter to him.
you should run, don't walk, and don't look back.
i learned as a result of instruction from you over many years.
the measurements 36-24-26 used to be considered ideal so you are not far off.
being direct may be difficult but it gets the message out.
they are all my friends since i do not have an enemy.
i need a woman who is open to having sex.
but, i have very strong feelings for both of them.
a weird person in bed.
i like my friend who is a guy and i wish he would ask me out on a date.
you should let the guy say it to you first.
leave it alone; do not rush things.
when she has sex with you and then does not want to leave.
try passing gas loudly next to her while she ties her shoe; women love that.
you know you can not see yourself with anyone else but him or her.
i think it would be on a black man.
you know that is true, girls.
describe your time in bed and see what you are doing.
i think at first i would be a little jealous.
when she acts nervouse tell her a lot of lies about how much you know.
i had always insisted that we were only friends.
then wait to see what he says.
learn to not talk like a guy.
it does not matter how hard to try to get away from it, everyone wants someone to love.
a lot of adults say "oh, kids do not know what love is".
it is alright if you are fifteen and he is seventeen.
you can fantasize about her while masturbating the next time you are in the shower.
you will be able to move on if you really want to; it is your choice.
do not beat yourself up over that.
i do not know, but it is fine with me.
i was married to a puerto rican-dominican. it was my personal experience that she was the most captivating woman.
i cannot think about another girl.
give someone a second chance, but never give them a third.
take as much time as you need to decide if you really love him/her.
in the beginning i liked my girlfriend as a friend, even though she loved me.
it just turns them on.
isn't your boyfriend, your boyfriend, for a reason?
tell the first one that something has come up, and you will not be able to go.
you can either lend them money or date them.
see if you can keep pace with us!
females enjoy emotional men, not homosexual men, there is a difference.
that is a dumb question.
that stresses me further!
no, if you're unattractive. yes, if you're attractive.
a little sex, but that's all.
listen to what type of excuse he invents.
the hard truth is that you can't.
messenger's old version: click on "add friend," and search by name, location, or yahoo id.
no, you might be letting the man or woman of your life go.
if it was me you were having dreams about.
if you love her, then get some assistance.
because, that is what it consists of.
ususally, they will tell on themselves.
ask her to go out for a coffee or something.
if you stay every once in awhile, one to two times per week, that should not be a problem.
what if i had married him, and then moved in with him?
if you have to ask, do not ask.
i think that it would depend on what the girl likes.
however, if you want to try to get her to admit it, tease her.
again, i am in high school and i do not associate with very many mean girls who always say mean things.
i would say do not do it.
so either way, take the time to learn about yourself; it can be fun.
i don't want to lose him.
woman have suicidal thoughts when they can not get past a relationship.
be a gentleman, talk about nice subjects.
how can i get him to stop?
he either feels the same way, or he does not.
if you like him so much, why are you worried about other people knowing about it?
sit down and tell her you need to talk, and no yelling, mom, and explain it to her!
i am a sci-fi/anime nerd, so now you know why i ask.
can i get some mens' perspectives too?
what kind of flowers do you like?
if they ask you the reason why then tell them the truth.
take him to your local church building.
so, i told him that maybe he needed to think about what he was saying, because "love" is a very strong word.
why did you even inquire about this?
speak to your mother and father.
good luck in looking for the best answer!
good luck in looking for the correct answer, ice princess p.s.
if you do, there is a large probability that she does, unless you are just conceited.
don't give up, you will find them.
how does one act as if he is in love?
do not flirt because it only causes problems and makes you look bad.
tell her in your own natural words.
attempt to spice things up.
i feel that people today will say say that they will do something even though they end up not doing it.
because it is just flirting, do not have expectations.
knock him out by punching him in the face.
the poem is nice; but, saying it straight to her face is manlier.
can you suggest any websites that may have that information?
the movies are quite impressive.
i wish you much success.
you should call that person.
she will stay if she loves you.
it will feel similar to butterfly wings fluttering in your stomach.
if you decide to date others in the meantime, it's okay as well.
no, you're not supposed to search for him.
you need to ask yourself, if you ever been like this before?
no need to keep searching, that's actually normal.
i have one that i love, does that count.
i do not really think that you can.
there are many reasons that are no good for a person that gets hurt.
it was only something that you ate.
i am confining this argument to being between two people, not the bigger love.  it really matters.
yes, they are  attractive though.
she/he comes up with nothing, even though he/she has two accounts with them.
now you have to decide.  how would you fall in love, as a girl or a woman?
fiance is a man or woman engaged to be married.
anyways, one way or another, you will come to regret your decision.
and then deny me the opportunity to experience that talent?
this sounds like one person likes the other to me.
so, talk to her. if she is okay with your plan, then you should ask him.
i was shy, and could not do it at least half of the time.
you still have time to enter into a relationship.
it is preferrable for you to end it immediately.
if he will not respond, you should step and spy.
simply tell her that she will always be a good friend, and continue.
if you love someone and are old enough to wed, you should propose.
do not become involved in a relationship immediately after you end one.
why am i asking this many questions?
when he is offline, she constantly says she misses him.
do not try to be someone who you are not.
it feels fantastic to be in love. it can also hurt sometimes.
if he's your ex boyfriend, then do what you want. you don't owe anybody.
yes, all women are sexy, some in different ways.
he only had to give you pillow talk.
perhaps he did not enjoy the kiss, or maybe he is too young for a mature girl like you.
(at least, a daily phone call.)
she said that she would like to be friends.
it seems like you may not perform as well as the men out there.
make a decision, he may surprise you.
i have never cheated, it is beyond my character to do so.
boys are about one year behind of girls on maturity levels
they think i behave like an angel.
is she near enough that she could help you in any situation that might occur?
your preference should be a woman, not a girl.
i do not know how a person could develop a disgusting fetish like that.
i believe in being honest while not being accusatory.
if he loves you, you should take care of him sexually.
i am an american man with white colored skin.
attempt to do what you both used to do together before you fell in love and got married.
stop typing and go get his attention.
you cannot because they are all taken.
do not tell him you love him.
you but, but if you are obsessed about him you should seek therapy.
i do believe in love at first sight.
stop typing, and go yell at him!
you can't, they are all taken.
don't tell him that you love him.
you could, but if you are obsessed over him, you should go seek therapy.
yeah, i do believe in love at first sight.
my answer is no.
they have been married for thirty-eight years.
you deserve someone trustworthy and faithful.
we would prefer someone more mature.
it is wise to keep your personal life separate from work.
you should talk to her, the two of you both like each other, go ahead before someone else gets to her first. good luck.
i would say that if both of you are happy, do not worry about it, but be careful.
you should marry and start a family right away.
then he would call me only to talk, he never asked me out.
he is probably a dirty pervert anyway. any one with self respect would not allow such an age difference.
the next step is to slowly take his hand while you are in church; you'll get the idea.
my boyfriend gets angry with me because i don't call him.
when you really want to be with someone you will find him quickly.
if you are interested, just ask him.
it may be better if they just think you are crazy but it sometimes does not work.
yes, and you will need counciling.
you should question weather it is possible for you to do.
this is similar to the differences between democrats and republicans.
you should inform him that it is ending, but continue having sex.
this is the polar opposite of what men do.
yes, you guys are going to need to have some counseling.
so, ask yourself, "can i do this?".
sort of like the difference between the democrats and the republicans.
tell him that it is over, but still do not stop the sex.
it is exactly the opposite of what men can give.
move on, and do not take her with you.
i believe that it is more of a commitment opportunity.
it is because men do not have the pain tolerance that most women do.
it is me, if you like him too.
a woman that i attended high school with had one.
why are you asking him to marry you?
the two of you are not doing yourselves any favors.
an attractive outfit of jeans and a shirt will be great.
i am returning your question to you.
check to see if it is in your address book.
why are you asking him to marry you?
you're not doing yourself any favors. you aren't doing her any favors either.
but, a nice outfit with jeans and a shirt is nice.
i'm giving you back your question.
see if it is in your address book.
i have heard that some have the ability to be nine inches in diameter.
girls are more attractive if they have long hair.
homosexual people are not the only people who can be shallow.
you should not have a exclusive relationship yet; you should be dating multiple women and having fun.
unfortunately women mature faster that men do, because they do not have the same maturity level.
enjoy the icecream while you are able.
there are men waiting for you.
women would like their boyfriends to be romantic and fun.
he is likely just irritated because you always ask.
search google for cruzy and you will see my point.
enjoy icecream while you can.
there are guys waiting for you.
women like their boyfriends to be fun and romantic.
he's probably just annoyed because you always ask.
google the keyword "cruzy," and see what i mean.
i am sure she won't mind if you wait.
if you always say yes to her, she will be satisfied.
i just want to know how other couples are doing.
let him have your body for 45 minutes for nothing.
my only problem is that i didn't do it sooner.
the shorter they are the better they look.
you will get the response now.
she had always wanted to accomplish it but never had the opportunity to do so.
you may go to your friend's house instead.
perhaps, there is an emptiness in your life.
simply keep going until you are finished.
no. you get a nasal drip if you snort it.
slipknot is no good. korn is original and good.
i am eager, as well, to see the answers.
force him to flirt first so that you are not the one to make the first move. then everything will go smoothly.
try to pick your game up a little bit if it is costing you.
well, in a perfect world, three to four times a day.  i cannot get enough.
it is impolite to cut anyone off, period.  it is rude.
if you are eight, it is not okay.
you are twenty-one years of age; therefore, you are wise enough to explain how to attract a guy.
i have been with my girlfriend for four going on five years and i have had a lot of others during this time.
do you think you are good looking?
are all the male counterparts here this way?
all my male peers like them also.
as long as you know what you are doing, it is okay.
when girls fall in love, it is the same as playing with a doll.
i say do not even think about his best friend.  it is easier to hate you than to miss you.
i still want to be treated as an equal.
i guess that is in the past.  what is really important is your life right now.
if this suits you, that which other people say doesn't matter! i have found my perfect match and i married him!
if it so happens that they have been engaging in combat often, perhaps you should ask mother about it.
you should do it girl. i did it and it was the best thing i have ever done.
i do not understand how that is a question; it is a statement.
well if the police are involved then she does not like you!
i would like to sleep with him now.
it could be because they are stupid, or it could be because of their self-esteem.
consider doing this with your conversation.
even though it may annoy you, let it go.  be a friend and listen.
it will not work if you do not.
you will have to first tell us what exactly it is you want.
i apologize, girl, i truly wish i knew the answer as well.
many women find themselves attracted to men who are unpleasant, also those that convey them self as "bad tough guys".
"who need a heart when a heart can be broken?", as the song lyrics state.
this would depend on the age of the girl.
ask a women whom you are close to such as a friend or sister, and see what they think about the situation.
no, you should not do this, it is bad.
coming from a mans perspective, i would say no.
you cannot control it or search for it.
if he winks at you, talks to you, or asks where you are then he does.
i think you should live on and let her live on as well.
was she really your sister or was she your best friend.
i can guarantee that he speaks poorly of you when talking to hims roommat.
please answer all of these questions: 1) does she flirt?
i would like to attempt it again this week but i'm concerned because i was very embarrassed when it did not fit.
some states do not do this, but some counties within the state may do so.
you should confess to her that you feel that way.
i understand that i am a man, but it works in the other way, too.
i would say flowers - normally roses - and a box of candy.
by the way, mine is green!
some states to not, but the county within the state does.
so confess to her that you feel this way.
i know, i know i am a guy, however it also works the other way around.
flowers, normally roses, and a box of candy.
by the way, mine is green.
i wait until i feel like i can understand my woman.
it should have been obvious to you that she had implants, so it is your fault.
i still am in love and i always will be.
then again, sometimes men do not always know what they have until they do not have it anymore.
i wear thongs as well, and i know that men like them.
if you both enjoy it equally, then why stop?
why are you involving yourself?
try something different, perhaps that will spark the attraction again.
perhaps you should concentrate on picturing her as a pet?
with that awful type of thinking, i don't believe you deserve anybody.
it is also important that you always be on the lookout for things happening around you.
start with a nice lunch then head out for a romantic walk.
if you want to keep believing that, you are fooling yourself because she isn't that type of person.
why do you feel that way? was your first one lost as well?
that may end up being a very positive developemnt.
your girlfriend should also keep her eyes wide open.
lunch, and then go for a walk.
she is just tripping because she doesn't have it like that.
why, did you lose your first one?
which may be a good thing.
men who cheat on you are likely to do it again.
i believe that sad people stay in relationships.
does he love you? if not, do not go after him.
do you flirt with women or look at women?
that is true, but it is up to you.
you can do anything that you would like without receiving criticism from others.
if my boyfriend was not 700 miles away right now, it would not.
or else she has mental health issues and should see a therapist.
ask them, and if they are, it is no fault of your own.
and you should apologize for being absent that day.
this is the only experience that is close to what heaven feels like.
if you are grounded about the situation, then everything should be fine.
talk to them about the weather.
if doesn't ask you, then he isn't interested.
if you just showered it shouldn't be a big deal.
it is the only experience that is closest to heaven, i guess.
as long as you are level headed about this, it should work out fine.
talk about the weather, ha ha ha.
if he isn't asking, he doesn't want it!
if all you did was shower, it is not a big deal.
you should suggest something subtle to begin with, such as having lunch or a beer.
if you do not, there is a reason why you do no.
if there is a chance she will date you, why would you not take that chance?
if he is incarcerated, maybe you should reconsider your relationship.
otherwise, he may have ulterior motives behind the love he proclaims.
introduce yourself, small talk, then ask if they'd like to out.
i can't get a date ever.
i continue to be in love with her.
after fighting, love will end up being much deeper.
i've seen him during gym.
he was on his knees when he said he would attend therapy sessions, but he never did.
learn how to dance, but not only how to dance provocatively.
if so, then give the man a chance.
love, passion, heat, and fire are needed in the bedroom.
good luck to the both of us.
get a copy of both playboy and playgirl magazines.
no judgment of either good or bad can be made.
her friends also approve of me and even adore me.
you should move on and find someone else.
she says she does not love me anymore and does not give me a reason.
i have the same ideology as you.
be accompanied by plenty of females, but do not stick to them.
if you do not like him now, you will most likely not like him in the future.
do not spend it because you are either depressed or hiding.
i wonder if she likes you.
if you do not know anything then jokes get boring quickly.
if you want a long term relationship, i am not interested.
you love this person, however your parents do not.
i like naughty girls who are good as well as naughty girls who are just naughty.
if you don't know anything, jokes get boring really quickly.
if you want a longterm relationship, no way.
you love this person in a way your parents don't.
i prefer a naughty, good girl, and a good, naughty girl as well.
if you want to die, no matter how you slice it.
it depends on if he was good and if he is a good friend now.
for me personally, it releases a lot of stress.
he would have gotten a divorce if he really cared about you.
you would call the psychic friends network.
tell them that you are going to be at your friends house, and then meet him somewhere else.
you shouldn't stop just because you're frightened.
if you both agreed to take time off, it wasn't cheating.
it's unusual, i believe. i believe it couldn't hurt to try.
if he's popular, most likely he already has a girlfriend.
you need to get over your fear, discipline your pet.
do not let fear overtake you.
you broke up with him when it happened.
he may or may not have a girlfriend.
if you want him to join in.
or, is it true that what comes around, goes around?
if they say that they do mind, then, you can fix it.
saves loads of trouble, which could come later!
because, my place is a dump!
if you would like him to join in, then . . .
could it be true that karma does exist?
if they are upset, then you can make amends.
this could help to avoid future problems.
my place is substandard.
but that does not mean that you can't still be nice.
try saying to her, "hey hot pants, how about a date with the stud-miester!"
plan a place to go and be fun.
if you do not love him, leave him and he will be fine in time.
it is just like any other request, it's your decision!
if you are a guy, maybe you are just curious, or your self esteem is not high.
you should read the book called "he's just not that into you."

on the other hand, popular guys don't have many attributes that last.
you aren't, if you even have to ask.
if you're a guy, you could be curious, or maybe you aren't confident enough.

you probably aren't if you have to ask.
the letters tsgf stand for 'transsexual gay female', while tsgm stand for 'transsexual gay male'.

i wasn't very intelligent at that time.
ask yourself a question: would you like to have that knowledge?
afterwards, we should go dancing and then go back home for some dessert.
he says he still loves me. should i leave him alone, and hope he misses me?
i am in love with a wonderful man and i love my beautiful children.
oh, the pornography; it was just hidden from me, so when i found it, i disposed of it.
your world and everything you have done has been distorted because of this girl; you are in love.
most men dream of being with an attractive 24 year old virgin. you are fortunate.
he doesn't seem to care about you enough.
sex addiction is similar to any other addiction.
if he truly loves you, he'd act like it.
quickly. i need some suggestions.
you have a wife, and you cheated on her with a man?
smile at her but not so much that you frighten her.
the bottom line is that both of you should have fun.
the only answer is that they have found something better.
bullhockey, if you want to yell at her or strike her, then you don't love her.
i wouldn't advise a relationship with him, as those with many insecurities can eventually turn dangerous.
are you cleaning up after two untidy people?
deep down inside, do women, think like men?
if not, try to move on.
if you don't care for that woman, why did you have a relationship with her?
relationships are always stronger when you have a strong friendship before dating.
you should attempt to talk with other people.
you must first decide what your budget is, what she enjoys, and if you are serious about having a long term relationship with her.
in a sense, obsessively following you at your work and other places.
many men are praying for you.
if they don't end up fighting, don't concern yourself.
if you receive no kisses, or no hugs, how will it become love?

have you ever considered if she felt the same?
you shouldn't try, let it occur naturally.

i would like to have sex with you.

i would ask her, then explain why.
how well do you know the man you are in a relationship with?
why yes, there is, and he is me.
there is nothing that disgusts me more than looking at my reflection/
sometimes i only have sex with women to have fun and i do not even plan on returning their calls.
i only told her about one situation, but i know more that he has done than just that.
money and nice items are wonderful, but they could not care less about you.
maybe he would like for you to ask him.
i take women out there and they seem to enjoy themselves.
try to figure out what it is that she really prefers to do in her spare time.

you do not have to control him as much as you do.
do people not take there vows seriously anymore?
just do what will make you happy.
go back to your parents, and then start looking for a relationship so that you can marry again.

i think flowers are very nice, but flowers are not given to women very often these days.
you are able to make this successful.   good luck!
baby, do not hurt me, do not hurt me, any longer.
is it okay, if it is meant innocently?
i despise feeling that way. however, i can not help feeling lustful towards young women in their twenties.
i miss her a lot as well.
young lady, you should leave him and find someone more worthy.
you could let your husband discover you having inappropriate relations with your girlfriend.
would you be willing to take steps to see if we could have a lasting relationship?
i hate feeling that way, but i just have this total lust for youthful girls in their early 20's.
i miss her a lot too.
move on girl, and go find a real man.
allow your husband to walk in on you and your girlfriend have oral sex.

let her go and move on.
never look back on things like that unless it is to learn from mistakes.
i like fat women, i do not like anorexic skinny women!
then it will kick over to another site that does not have information on the person.
i love to run, swim, and eat chocolate!

sometimes the guys forget that i am still a girl.
friends stand by each other no matter what happens.
you are a convenience to him and nothing more than that.
women love being told that they are pretty!
i am not saying with other women but definitely with you.
in some cases, if you wait too long you lose out.
my assessment is that you should try to help them make it legitimate because you care as well.
the reason is that it's easier to obtain a correction.
i don't know whether he if fond of me, however.
tell him that it makes you excited.
ninety percent of my best friends are male.
guys like girls that do not play games or leave them guessing.
hold hands, kiss, deeper kiss, and there you are.
please note that this has to take less than ten seconds.
i hope it does not rule us out.
if you continue doing what you are doing, you will get anything you want.

the solution is to keep asking him until he opens up and talks.
god definitely has to come first.
it's not a good idea to have a reputation for switching guys like gloves.
most women can only please one man at one time.

get on your knees and take care of him.
soppy version at one and geek version at two.
not if you have just met this man.
if not, then it probably means nothing.

why would a girl stop loving a guy who loves her more than anything else?
no matter what age the two of you are, it's always a big step.
you should personally connect with her to let her know you want to continue your friendship.
i disagree with the thought that you greet her at a later point.
you have damaged the relationship with me and with our children.
i am of the view that it depends on the woman.
if you are getting too upset, pause the conversation.
girls and nerds alike are cute and look honest.
cheating on you once is a mistake but twice?
my parents still do not know that i have had boyfriends.

take a deep breath, walk up to her, and say, "hello, would you like to go somewhere?
if you think more about it, you may decide you are less certain that you initially thought you were.
your current situation is good.

acting that way does not display empathy.
i can not as her directly since we do not talk anymore.
you should only get married if you love someone, not just because you are having a child together.
i dislike it with a passion.

it is best to just leave and not over-analyze the situation.
my best friend is in puerto rico, while i am here in new jersey. i miss her dearly.
focus on the outcome that you desire.
if you truly do not care, do whatever you want.

that would be the greatest first date!
i have had many friends do similar to men, as what has occurred with yourself.
many are fathers, some aren't.
the majority of my male friends trust me, and know i'm there for them.
i believe he thinks the question is referring to him.
beforehand, you would have to take the first step.
ask him if there is somewhere casual he likes to eat lunch, and that should be fine.
but, i enjoy dating and i like to get to know people intimately and to hang out with them.
if you are not out of the closet, then how do you know that you want to date other women?
i would be moderately suspicious if she spoke to her ex-partner every day.
there is a lot going on here.

perhaps, you just don't trust her, sir.
let her know you'll be careful, but you'd better be careful!

what happened to make you and him split up?
just tell them that you do not feel the same, nicely.
i think it is nice to fall in love as many times as you can in your lifetime.

he does not present her with an invitation to join him at his family's house.
the couple presently has two more children afterwards. yes, the man has matured.

this person is your best friend, the one you love, and your partner for the rest of your years!
why would it be assumed that a person is gay, just because they have never had sex?

yes, it is okay. age is just a number.
and, how much you love him.
this is your best friend, your lover, your mate for life!

you should check out a gay bar in your area.

if not, then at least you are still friends.
do you think about her all the time?
that is begging for a present.
instead of saying something along the lines of "i am sick of hearing about your boyfriend."
if in doubt, go eat at in'n'out burger.

if you ask her kindly, she will accomplish what you ask of her.
if you keep us satisfied at home, will not run away.

he does not want me to tell the father.
i love a woman who has full lips, a nice round backside, and big breasts.
that is like asking if a guy likes oral sex.
yes, you can, but do you not think that you need some more time to truly know each other?
sign up for the options that you believe you would prefer.
just be careful that you do not get wasted.
what age are his children?
love does not have very much to do with it; it really depends on the money.
i would still be attracted to you even if it went past your shoulders.

if she is accepting gifts, please be careful.
if you do not take risks you may not succeed.
i'm frightened to phone her, i'm unsure what to state.
i'm a man, so no.
you'll be unable to get that man to adore you.

he is an ex for a reason, correct?
then think of something that has to deal with how to ask her out.
i don't want to break up with him because i really love the guy.
why are you thinking of him?
i am in the same position, as my boyfriend lives in another state.
however, please do not take this for granted.
and if he is happy, you will be happy.
it feels good but it hurts a lot.
why not choose a younger, more virile man if this was only about a way to get into the united states?

i love you tends to mean "let's have sex now."
if you really think about it, half the world is shallow.
no, you're not. you're just passing time until "mr. right" comes along.
you are scared. you're probably not alone. he's probably thinking the same thing.
no, a lot of the stuff i've gotten that was expensive just fell apart.
you need to consider the question, "what if you get pregnant?"
because their lame behinds get a girlfriend, or two!
your are just passing the time while waiting for mr. right.

bad boy, bad boys, what you gonna do?
it depends, does he love you back?
i advise against attempting to change a person because it never works.
sex on the bed is extremely ordinary.
does this person make you daydream about your future together?

i will do whatever i have to do--go to xxx stores, online shops--but you have to understand that i am desperate.
i would not give her so many gifts.
purchase him some clothes or discuss the matter with him.
you need to be firm.

i have not found a single girl who seems very intelligent.
please do not say "i love you" until you are truly committed to the relationship.

if you're comfortable doing it, then i think you should.
that story has been told before, but you've got to love those who don't want to hear it.
that is when love will find you.
that's a really good question honey, and since i am going through the same thing i can offer you this advice: try to erase him from your memory and go on with your life.
you can always try to touch yourself while thinking of him, and possibly introduce adult toys into your foreplay.
please call the police if she said you could be next.
all i know is that i get very excited when i see pretty red hair.

be as authentic as you were before.
yes you can. it is imperative that you remember why you developed feelings for him, initially.

initially, the experience is uncomfortable; however, you get used to it over a period of time.

try your hardest to win her affections back.
just do not try to talk to her.
it is more enjoyable this way, but it is not required.

you are a good friend, but my feelings go beyond friendship.
they are sexually attractive and a turn-on!
your heart is telling you to go and confess to her!

it doesn't matter who they are, if they are married then they are off limits.
you have plenty of time, so do not rush into anything.
he is probably interested in you for the wrong reasons.
yes. i am in love. i love my children and grandchildren unconditionally.
if men do not speak often enough, then that could mean one of many things.

if another woman comes between a man and woman who are already in a relationship, a fight will almost certainly ensue.
talking about controversial topics may not go well with certain people.
i am an only child and it can be lonely.
i am telling you this because i have read about it quite a lot.
i like a guy in my friend's class.
grab him and give him a big kiss.
if you like a bowl of soup then wouldn't a bigger bowl be even better?
no, this is not love.  if he really loved you it wouldn't matter.
learn how to roll with it ever so cautiously, or get out of the jungle.
sure, if he would like it.
i have experienced it and it was horrible.
excitement in the bedroom is also great.
i would prefer not to.
just love her, too, if you like her.
there isn't anything wrong with it.  do what makes you happy -- i think more people should be like that.
try talking to her friends and see what she lieks.
invite him for dinner.  your parents will get to know him and will trust him.
trust me, she will like it.  that was what my boyfriend gave me and it really touched my heart!
if you hide it, it will end up hurting worse in the end.
"hi, my name is kevin" worked for me.
ask him if he would like to go to the movies with you saturday.
i thought it was just me, i guess not.
if you feel you are too shy, try to just relax and have fun around him.
when you are an adult, or in love.
because you think you are very clever.
i do not know what she means by that, or how to improve my conversational skills.
if that's not an acceptable option, i think the best thing for you is to start seeing other people.
the woman you're currently with may not be your soulmate, but there is definitely someone out there for you.
i think you should call her right now and simply say, "i'm gay." then see what her reaction is.
please, be sure to tell me if you get something nice.
if you know what i mean.
the thing guys want is a petite girl who is good at housework.
it is between the f spot and the h spot.
why on earth does your wife want to have an affair ?
dating someone to make your ex spouse jealous is utterly pathetic !
tell him that if your girl had sex with her friend he would enjoy it.
also, it is a plus if she has nice breasts.
you need to act. good luck.
four months ago, he ended our relationship.
the other man took my idea.
find a nice woman and marry her.
a kiss on the cheek, maybe, but you don't need to make out if you don't want to.
most of us really are.
if you like him, try dropping hints and see how he reacts.
it doesn't matter if he's an older man, but it does matter if he's married.
if he really loves you he will wait until you are ready.
i love my dog and think it's the best.
why don't they think about caring and what love means?
if you want to get his attention hit him on the butt and ask him to take you out.
cheating is wrong.
i'm not sure what to say how did you find out?
i am "sugarlump" and he is "sqog"!
he will even get me gifts for no reason!
be honest about girl, ok?  just be honest.  oh yeah, i'm a guy, by the way.
only if it is beyond repair.
however, do not use it just to get some.
there is nothing wrong.  it is just that we are not used to it.
i dream of my son a lot.
sex is just sex, no strings attached.
if he's married, that's bad karma.
when she diverts herself into the restroom?
if you are attracted to a man, and you think he is attracted to you.
this way, if you feel they will reject you, you do not have to do it.
i completely sympathize with you about the situation.
just do not become the villain in your son's perspective.
that is the best option for it.
you are the only one who can know if it is right for you.
it is the normal for this area.
i want to call her, but i do not have the courage to.
yes, you passed the scrutiny.
they do not want to hurt the guy
i don't understand what you said.
if you are a lesbian and you really love her then i think you should.
if you want to humiliate him catch them kissing.
i am sixteen and have been unsuccessful finding someone to speak to can you help?
they only want a little dangerous edge.
do you want to get back at this person, or get even?
you should at least pretend to possess that quality.
after that, i spoke it aloud.
you would so jealous.
you have nothing to lose.
if you do, can i ask why ?
he is not worth it if he is willing to ruin a good thing for a fling.
if he dares to mess with you then you tell him what's right.
if you ask that question, you will not be satisfied with the answer.  perhaps it is better to say i want to get on with my life and good luck in yours.
i cannot meet a decent man on the internet.
it has been said that if one is dishonest, it is difficult to regain the trust of others.
some people stick with tradition while planning their special day and don't even kiss until their wedding.
here's some easy advice: first, tell him that you love him and you cannot live without him in your life.
i'd have to say no - once someone decides to be unfaithful, it's an easy thing for them to do again.
a couple of the little touches women can add that are very noticable include wearing a ribbon in her hair and pulling her hair into a ponytail.
sorry, i already have a partner.
i am very sorry to hear that.
if he flirts back with you, he may be a player.
go for it, but do not over do it. good luck!
he is cheating on you and using you too!
i know it is weird, but that's just how they are.
we don't have to find someone that is good looking in order to fall in love with them.
my answer is a little late, but i would still like to give you some advice.
women tend to lie easily, and then they ask us men to be truthful.
me? never, i will love you forever.
(no, i am not a failure, but i am not popular. i am just a normal person, but he is popular.) please help me!
i love her, and she loves me.
have you tried out relationships with different kinds of men--for example, men who prefer sassy women?
it means that you are examining other women too closely and making her feel insecure.
well, apparently your grandmother loves you. you still exist, correct?
please try to consider the matter from his perspective.
i cannot wait for the answer.
i am in complete agreement with linda01.
contact me when you receive a reply.
often they beat around the bush, so he will get an idea that you are interested in him.
i need to tell you something, it has really been bothering me.
yes and sometimes sleep.
love is like the wind, you cannot see it but you can feel it.
you have your entire life ahead of you, enjoy being young and in love.
by the time she does climax, it will be the best one she has had.
no, it is important that you find the true thing.
in the end you will find yourself heart broken.
life is troubling for me at the moment, i could use some assistance.
consider this before you decide to give yourself to him.
no matter the outcome, he'll need you to be there for him.
is this the same you you were previously telling me about?
i have hope that you will get married.
after investing so much into the relationship, it was extremely hard to get through the separation.
just tell your man that you have had enough, and it is either you or her.
usually, men who are insecure want you to do this to boost their egos.
i think it is a good practice to wait until you are married to have sexual relations.
we cannot simply live together as man and wife anymore.
does anyone understand the situation?
the one i discovered below is located outside of california!
moreover, you will not stop because you are still in love with him.
where girls are concerned, what are your preferences?
that is because i am always dreaming about her.
if not, you may be growing apart.
although she likes someone else, should i tell her how i feel?
go and beat up your friends.
if you are that young, maybe it is not an issue.
it depends on how he or she is classified under class clown.
you are allowed to have a friend approach and attempt to seduce him.
that is just your mind playing tricks on you.
alright, give this person a lot of attention and attempt to seduce him.
the most are on the 14th of february and the 15th of june, while least the least would be during april and january.
perhaps if you were to have asked her while she was more intoxicated than bob dylan was before a performance.
i have been going out with a girl eleven years older than me for eleven years.
other than sticking them in a room i suggest telling them to talk it out among themselves.
salt and pepper shakers, towels and wash cloths, silverware, bathroom set, etcetera.
if he is married then yes, duh.
he never had intimate relations with her?
it is best if you obtain proof from your doctor.
in order to attract girls, you must find a balance between serious and not overly serious.
i know of no one who is perfect the first time.
if jesus is a strong part of your marriage, everything else will be better.
although she lives upstairs, i am unable to visit her.
that's probably where i went wrong, right?
there aren't that many good men out there, so be careful!
trust me it happened to me too, and i feel much better.
i don't see anything wrong with a little bit of physical affection.
ask him what is going on with that other girl.
why are you asking this question i wonder?
hello @chillin, i agree with @superman, you should cast your vote for him!
no child, it just happened at this very moment i believe.
i can't help but wonder about her.
ask him, and depending on the answer, break up with him and then see what is happening.
i really want a girlfriend,  but, she has to be hot!
a girl says to her guy, "i am pregnant. "
he came back two days ago!
if you think life is so difficult right now, if you make a wrong choice, it can only get worse.
yes, for a while, i could not stand to have sex with my boyfriend.
if you have to ask, you are probably too young to be trying.
personally i do not like them.
if you are not attractive, are you kind?
keep waiting because your friends will find you a person, or that person will come to you.
i think it is wrong because they are your friends, but that does not make it less negative.
he just need slapped around a little bit.
this works for this type of arrangement.
and i can honestly say now, i'm glad i never got the  guy!
just out of curosity. how  big is the average male 'part'?
the stork receives your email, and it'll  bring you a little brother or sister.
is there any sign that he may like you too?
first of all make sure that he even knows you exist.
for me there isn't a difference, it's better to make love then just having sex.
you may see it as a date, but i do not.
i need to know what someone other than my friends think.
do not let anything bother you.
love and romance go hand in hand.
you will know if that person loves you.
that was on my mind too.
phone him from your mobile phone.
it is safe to have sex if you are only doing it with your wife.
you should not continue on the path you are on, or you may get hurt.
the man i am interested in is not interested in me. he is interested in my friend.
it does not matter who it is with.
i want to know what they like to do, only talk or something else.
she is has blonde shoulder length hair.
walk up to him, look him in the eye and ask him.  if he flinches, beware.
i notice your friend likes her too.
she is not part of my community.
if you choose not to leave him, there is nothing you can do.
introduce yourself and come around often.
many mistakes are made in haste.
there is no nicer way than to tell her the truth.
if she does, how would i find out?
instead of possibly getting your girlfriend pregnant, or worse, it would be a safer way to see things. do you agree?
first, think. second, look.
you have to be brave all the time.
(they are waiting for you to pay the cab fare.)
do not purchase the inexpensive varieties, because they hurt.
also, you should not waste time and act before some other individual informs her of their feelings for her.
have you passed this information along to anyone else?
that is not true. i have gone to that stage before, and you will not enjoy it!
understand yourself first; do not concern yourself with others.
try practicing yoga--the muscles you will build up will make sexual activity more enjoyable for you.
i am astonished that you actually needed to ask this!
simply love him as a friend.
i contact him once a month, and sometimes i worry about his relationships with other girls.
no, it is not weird, and you should listen to what the other people said: do what makes you happy.
go into yahoo chat, click on "music."
some women already know how to do these things.
shania, because of her looks, her figure, and her mind. on pam, it is only because of her breasts.
check your grammar and your spelling and you might receive a response.
how do i know if he is cheating?
wait to consummate your relationship until marriage.
it is not stupid, it is called love.
i am not any of the ages you listed.
i think this beats anal, 1000 fold.
the way they act around you.
you will see if he really cares about you.
share what ever you are comfortable sharing about yourself.

my mattress and sheets are very comfortable.
we have been friends for five years and i don't want our friendship to end this way!!!!
one day you will appreciate him!
she needs to be completely honest with you, even if she needs to scream.
i too, married a guy who was in prison.
how am i supposed to know?
also, be sure to listen, rather than just making small affirmative noises.
i liked your message. send me an email so we can chat.
i'm sorry to hear that. you sound like a very nice person.
he acts like he hates me.
the opinions of other's should have no effect on your life.
aren't you the guy that asks girls to sleep with him?
to be completely honest, it would be better if you asked him.
i can't begin to delve into the rest of that question.
does it actually hurt the first time?
he says that he would take a girl with some meat on her over an anorexic-looking girl any day.
i am sorry she did that to you.
you should be ashamed of yourself!
i know this will not be enough, but just hang in there; at least you are trying.
i did not let him know how much it hurt to be just friends; i just let him see me.

no offense, but most cheerleader are stuck up, i have met a few that aren't though.
until death do we part.
i would't worry about it too much.
try to be friends with him to see what is happening.

just come out with it, when he comes over to see you.
stick with him, and eventually you will stick as well.
anyway, i hope this answers your question, and does not sound too sick. it was you who asked, after all.
and he cannot always spend time with me because he live 15 minutes away!
not at all. as long as there is chemistry, age is just a number.
you are still so young an have a lot going for you in life.
what other reasons is it why you 2 should get married?
i cannot deal with lies.
do you know of the little boats in italy?
have sex with them both at the same time!
its your life, enjoy it, live it your way.

men can make it out to be more than it is.
find a hobby you both enjoy.
it is cute to see them break rules but get a life and get over it.
i don't know about myself, but my mom's friend got married to a black fellow.
i am uncertain if you should go that deep.
bear in mind the shyness of my personality.
if he doesn't like you, then it shouldn't matter.
if you are desperate for marriage then you can marry anybody.
skinny things do not do it for me.
we broke up and now i just want to be friends.
if you are jj, then there is no way that kaylin likes you.
it depends on your age, but it's possible you're just late.
i have a friend named taylor. i have gone out with two boys, named jake and dalton.
i suggest you tell her to back off! you need to fight for what you want.
yes, but do you think he was really focused on anything at the time?
if he feels the same way i do, is that true love?
what do you mean by this question?
she introduced me to a nurse she knows.
he has a wife, not simply a girlfriend.
some people do not take marriage seriously.
they no longer care.
how are you going to marry them if they are still in prison?
if he does, you should talk to him.
you should worry if you are 50 years old and have never been kissed.
you are still young.  you have to find the right person.
never trust people unless they are your parents or siblings.
usually if someone cheats once, they will probably do it again.
he was the one person who wasn't afraid to tell my parents where to shove it!
i hope that time will run it's course, and i will be able to have sex once again.
why is that nothing like what we wished for?
if you don't love him, i don't think would care as much if he cheated on you.
i always wondered why girls don't like me.
it's probably the same result you want.
i do when i want to, but he gets mad most of the time.
especially when i tell her that i love her.
think of the things that he would like the best!
be patient, if he is fond of you, he will ask you on a date once more.
i attract many women and they say it is very good.
is it worth the time spent acquiring it again and at what cost?
i do not believe he ever will.
give him a small kiss often.
whether it is 6000 miles as mine is, or 6 miles.
some women find nice men to be boring.
i couldn't see it with this women, so when she got her citizenship she moved out of town.
my wife said she would because she wants to be sure i am happy.
make it fun for both of you.
if it takes 20 years, then so be it.
jerks like him give decent men a bad reputation.
all of a sudden, it just stops!
i know you are a traditional man.
when i see women behaving this way, it always amazes me.
first off, it was a strange feeling, then you become comfortable.
i did not change my name after my divorce because i did not want to put in the effort.
the size of the woman should not be taken in to account.
i believe that it can be one way or another.
he looks at more than what the egotistic cheerleader shows on the outside.
i just took my girlfriend to see the movie memoirs of a geisha.
you should not start dating a guy just because you think he is attractive.
that man has a plan for you!
my brother loves a girl and i have only met her once.
if the guy is secretive with you, he is not worth having a relationship with.
let him stop lounging around, have him go pick our a ring, and make him plan a romantic night for once!
i never really lost what i thought i had because it never existed!
do not think of something that does not exist.
this is from my experience with a few men, and does not pertain to all of them.
firstly, spend time with both your best friend and your boyfriend.
you want to talk about having a full plate?
question 3:  do you really love him?
in two weeks i will be 13 years old.
does all this mean he likes me?
if you like him, do not exaggerate it.
treat her differently than you would other girls.
if i were in your position, i would tell her.
you don't know how the other person will react.
people who cheat on their partners likely don't care much about them.
my husband and i are both 28 years old.
that means that she loves you for you.
you were his friend, and is know with their mom, so be careful what you wish for.
why won't he let me go?
ask newer questions so we can get more activity on yahoo!
i encourage you to forgive him.  you owe him an apology.  let him know that you were not being serious.
the idea that he didn't want you to see the text message is peculiar.
i am 18 years old and in my first semester of college.
you cannot keep your significant feelings over everything to yourself.
treat them like trash.
i wasted two years of my time!
i do not believe in romance without legal marriage, even if she also likes to have a home.
i was 22 years old when we met.
i suspect that you gave him your heart and body long ago.
ask him what he is staring at.
never use the "l" word.
if he knew how upsetting the initial blow was, i'm sure he's never talk again.
he is waiting until marriage.
why are you refusing to call him?
if a man cheats once he will cheat again.
who couldn't use another good friend?
i'm sorry but you need to be there for your wife an child.
you don't have to unless you both want tooz
is he a player?
you, to make yourself comfortable when you are around him.
i am not a man, but, one time, i did cry from having a multiple orgasm during my first rear entry sexual experience!
it is good to smile, it shows that you are confident.
why won't he get satisfaction from his girlfriend, if you think he is just looking for casual sex, you should simply ask.
do you really want to break up with your fiance?
this is the point at which you should start trying new things and try to get into the right mood.
it is due to the men you are choosing, because not all men act that way.
ask his friends for assistance in entering into a relationship.
avoid attempting to persuade yourself that this idea is not a good one.
simply tell the person you find them annoying, or, altenatively, when the person starts to annoy you, ask them to stop.
it is the best way to go!
another option is to become a pornography star!
god made you and cares about each one of his children.
a 6-inch gauge is attractive when worn by an attractive guy.
if he already has a girlfriend, then move on to someone else.
i have no boyfriend, but i do have a wife. hah!
i told you not to act or panic. it's nothing but a hormone rush. enjoy it and stay calm. at least you know you love him.
you won't ever find a good-looking guy with a big woman.
that is because you are stalking or sweating them or perhaps just annoying.
yes, i think you should, but at first only as close friends.
can you leave little love notes around the house along with the shaving kit?
he loves you too right?
even if you are being selfish take care of yourself and don't hold a grudge.
that usually means you asked the wrong guy.
awww, don't listen to those two.
you have to stop loving him.
yes, to my little cousin, but not to someone special.
tell them it's over i don't want you, you're a jerk.
i sat with her the first day that i saw her.
get to know each other and spend time together.
sex, to women, means commitment. one-night stands are a slap in the face and basically make a woman feel like a prostitute.
if you want a prostitute, find a prostitute.
some men do not kiss women while having sex, but it is the most enjoyable when they are affectionate.
for instance, if you could be any animal, what would it be and why?
don't mistake me, i love them dearly and am very happy for them.
the right guy is out there. you just haven't found him yet!
you should never date a friends ex according to the code.
the guy got slapped in the face.
your mental and physical health will be affected for many or the rest of your years.
that is the way women behave.
she is older than him by three years.
leave at once.
chat rooms should not be taken seriously.
you must express what you are feeling.
by the way, i am not too concerned over what your friend thinks -- they're not the one in a relationship with him.
the best advice i can give you is to be yourself and keep everything inside your comfort zone.
there is a possibility that you two can resolve your issues and become a couple again.
before you do this, consider how it will affect everyone else around you.
at last, i am in agreement with the girl.
does that make you between the ages of 12 and 17, or gay, if you post here?
if you could say, this is a breather.
i like you just as a friend.
you can be the best friend in her life.
best wishes in your future relationship.
he can doubt that we notice his actions, but we assuredly do.
my friend is visiting who is the daughter of a family friend.

nice question, my answer, go to a place where morality and insanity works hand in hand
my situation is similar to yours but i am opposed to divorce.
there is, of course, always love.
i don't know as yet, and i don't plan to know for a little while longer.
the answer is yes, and he didn't know in advance.
perhaps your girlfriend is unattractive.
you should question him and discover if he does in fact love you.
if they marry, it will make their wedding night so much more special!
as with women, some cheat and some do not.
love is forever; if you spread love to everyone, you will be remembered forever.
well, if you are willing to abstain from sexual activity, then we have a deal.
why are you head-over-heels in love?
i dislike using the phone frequently.
introduce yourself and get to know him.
there are girls who like class clowns.
needless to say, i am devastated!
i am not quite sure if this is her; i will ask, " are you tammy?" .
i am in agreement with everyone that feels it is too late.
if you were in fact being sweet, you would likely get sweetness reciprocated.
that is the only thing that will make him remorseful.
i thought she lacked attractiveness and intelligence.
i posed this question once, but perhaps i need to explain myself further.
there are wireless game pads and headphones and other exciting products available now.
they will do as much as they can get away with.

i have a boyfriend and i am interested in another man.
if she made a mistake, she should be forgiven.
he often stares and throws objects in my direction.
i told my previous partner my true feelings of love for her.
i am unfamiliar with that.
after a short period, he will cheat on you again.
my husband and i got married last year, but have been together since we were 10 and 11 years old.
find out why they are accusing you of that.
just say: if you don't like me, just leave.
he doesn't seem like he is worth changing your entire future for, trust me.
i am just too old of a guy to be talking with a young girl of your age.
smile, laugh, do whatever it is that you do to have fun.
i never realized how much i liked them until i wore regular panties again one day.
i have a good friend named hannah.
i do not know about you, but if it is good it makes me laugh, not cry.
i agree with all the people in here.
having intamate relations with two women at the same time is just nasty!
it is crazy and fun and totally cool.
honey, if he loves you enough to wait then you have a much better chance of things working out.
you are married and your wife wants to cheat and it is okay with you?
class clowns do not attract girls.
i have not.  the best thing is to talk to an attorney.  best of luck.
it means that you are smarter that most 18 year olds.
is it true or false that women are jealous of their friends?
the respectful course of action is to not override your parents rules.
a marriage is a holy contract that should not be mocked or made fun of.
i think you should try calling her.
we are talking but i don't know if he likes me, someone please help me.
try asking her out in a few weeks.
talk to her about it instead of just ignoring her!
instead of looking for a relationship, let it find you.
in my opinion, you should check again and ask a guidance counselor.
to answer your question, women get more pleasure because men love to please.
it is true that women mature before men.

so you are getting your revenge.
present to them something that you secretly adore.
test this person, so that if they fail you can move onto the next one sooner rather than later.
yes he will.  what's he doing now?
if you think he is cheating you shouldn't stay with him.

tell him to get over it, you love him an that's all that should matter.
he never tells me he loves me anymore, there isn't any communication.
don't waste your virginity nor any time.
she possibly means the conversation is superficial.
it is in your best interest to pursue your ambition.
having intercourse solely in the bed can become routine and boring.
no, and if anyone says otherwise you are homosexual (it is no crime if you are).
i have not told him due to the fact that men the age of 25 do not want commitment.
if he loves you hold on to him.
of course, he asks you out on a date.
this is the third time this week i have seen this question.
she is probably not lonely; more likely, she just wants to be happy.
if you are unsure, you can confirm the information online.
i'm skeptical, but i'm willing to be open-minded if you have that level of skill.
and also, you cannot make her accept your proposal.
no, i do believe some ladies are very cute, but i never could do anything with them.
why are you being a jerk to your friend? if she is bugging you just tell her.
but i also love the nurse lady very much.  would i be selfish to get a divorce?
yes, like the previous woman stated, an interracial relationship.
have fun, explore, be flirtatious instead of shy.

you can work out with me, i suppose but only just you.
that's just a few ways to be sure. have faith, for you will know when it happens.
also, it is full of sweet, nice, caring men.
please help me figure this out, why do some girls like me like to suck?
that's a hard one, but you can't force yourself to fall in love.
that last answer should help, not that one, the one above it.
i don't get a break or vacation, or relief, you just go and stay.
will i have sex with girls?
you could try to hang out with her, or accidentally bump into her in the hall.
it is the same as with perfume -- less is more, ladies.
a relationship just means that you are going to be loyal -- no cheating
they have a moist vagina and you do not have to worry about them playing games with you.
how do i tell her that i like her?
there are plenty of guys out there to find!
your grandmother might have killed him.
i agree with chacha777, you are even blessed that you have one.
my parents hate him, and will not accept him because of the way he looks.

the moment you believe you have figured them out, you are hit.
now i feel unusual if i am wearing anything except a thong.
he cannot be trusted and should not be dated again.
i did not cheat on her but did not want to listen to her constant accusations, so i broke off our relationship.

my friend, five yellow flowers mean friendship (long lasting friendship, if you like) but not love.
did you know that frowning uses one thousand muscles?
none of them really qualify because they are too old.

simply keep friends, it makes life easier.
she is your best friend, so just tell her nicely.
romans 1:24-32: lord, please deliver and save this girl.

depending on their age, start a casual conversation and see where it leads.
you've been dating a man for five years.
he also feels that you have forgive him.
i do not know where it is (i am convinced that is how it got its name).
but know he will tell about it to all of his friends
just think about it this way: you will be saving someone's body from pain and embarassment.
in certain games, when you have no score it is recorded as "nil."
if she found out that you knew that she was the one who murdered him, then she would murder you as well.
he gets more unfortunate stuff from you, and then you decide you do not want to be with him again, you are not a good girl friend.
depending on how much he has affections for you, it could be impossible.
this typically will begin an interesting conversation.
start flirting with single men you are attracted to, and get to know them better.

that is because it is darker and colder, but do not worry. you are not alone.
if "heads," then yes. if "tails," then no.
asking him in person is the best way to get an answer.

it beats faster and more often when we look at the woman we have strong affections for.
say, "hi, how are you doing?"
how do you feel about this woman?
i need to rest.
you can try asking her directly if she would want to first.
it would depend on which you would think tastes better, either a ham sandwich or the number 14.
try to be peaceful, to impression, and to get your friends back.
i know that you are in love!
i wish you luck; hopefully he propses!
both of you must learn how to trust the other.
i am not sure what you are asking.
i am still trying to figure that out myself.
i'm asking you for help since you are already among my closest friends.
intimacy isn't always what it's cracked up to be, you might just find that you enjoy this much more.
some people need to make better use of their free time instead of wasting it.
on occasion, i've felt as though i were on cloud nine because she was cordial to me.
your subconscious mind will probably be giving you signals when it's time to stop.
inform him or her that you are not going to lie any longer.
go out with him, but leave with a different person.
if he is too big, he can hurt a girl.
ignore her and invite your boyfriend.
it is worth a discussion.
my husband and i just got married a little over a month ago, and we have silly nicknames for each other.
i try to play the "quiet type" and do most of my flirting with looks.
i once told a girl something similar.
some women can see through that ploy.
would he be willing to suck your big toe?
well that is what my sexual partner does!
like, when they say they desire to have sex with you.

but you will always love him.

yes, very good idea. thank you!

alright. well, i just need a few suggestions on how to flirt.
do not do this unless you are happy to do so, especially if you are shot at. have fun and take care!
of course, i have also seen brilliant women who do not know anything about men. go figure!
of course, the girl has to be attractive.
you are the other girl.
do not be too cocky, because it will likely end in a bad result.
you cannot blame god for what is happening.  he creates man and woman to be together.
that is what they are able to receive.
if you are attractive and kind, i would love to meet you!
find the one then marry her.
yes it is, you guys don't know.
either way, you all have issues.
move one hundred miles away.
i didn't give her space, too bad, it took a long time to learn it was me.
good luck with school and life.
it has put a strain on his and your relationship.
what can i search for on the internet in the morning?
what is it?
i like girls who are happy and fun to be around.
if you are in love, tell me your story.
i am short of cash so i try to be frugal.
you may think me mad, but this is what i think and believe.
twenty years is a serious age gap. you are almost old enough to be her grandfather.
ask her why she wants you to cheat.
if you wait for him to approach you, you will know that he is the one.
as i am already familiar with a few attractive females, advice is appreciated.
please inquire if he finds you attractive.
you will become aware when you are communicating.
it is likely when you desire to spend the majority of your time with this individual.
what should we do as we are in love and he works while i am fifteen and he is sixteen?
i would enjoy being spanked with just enough force to be arousing.
i now believe boys and girls are embarrassed while feeling love for each other.
have you ever considered her possible preference for enjoying it that way?
it is comparable to those who love cheese cake yet desire only one slice.
if he is ugly, then maybe you should stay away from him.
to protect your heart, you should take it slowly and avoid planning a future with him.
i am not sure, maybe you should try some pepto-bismol.
do not do it at all.
you feel complete when that important person in your life kisses you.
try the rest stop if you have no luck.
i am only in seventh grade.
if you are sexually active and do not want to get pregnant you should take birth control pills.
i give blunt answers, so ask me what you would like.
she, among other things, has a wonderful personality.
why am i unable to find a proper man who lives in my general proximity?
if that is what he likes, let him be.
i have never had a romantic relationship with a woman.
do you know the location of the dish?
if you are interested in doing this then why should it matter what anyone thinks?
well, i am not looking for sex, but you can get sex through commitment and that's what i'm looking for.
if you feel like doing it, then do it.
the more honest you are the easier it makes it.
i think so, if you dated a girl.
tell her you don't have feelings for her anymore.
we believe tough guys are more popular and look better.
this statement is neither wrong or right.
my boyfriend is a really sweet and kind guy.
i don't know why not, she might like you too.
that situation was not as memorable as losing your virginity to someone you need to pay for sexual relations.
i would rather not ask personal relationship questions.
if he is happy then in turn, you will be happy also.
put yourself in his wife's position, how would she feel if she had this knowledge?
madden  '06 depends on what the gentleman prefers.
is it rare?
unfortunately, i have no advice to give. may luck be with you.
if the gentlman is not interested in your natural personality, then the relationship was not meant to be.
we must decide what we desire for ourselves first.
is not that sufficient to tell you that he likes you?
it was a phase that had me excited by every woman i saw; and i like all meat except fish, if that is a meat.
cronides just gave a great answer!
but one man and two women is not good.
please ask that question again.
i may not be as normal as you think.
you do not risk loosing his friendship.
are you not a man, what is wrong with you sir?
men are not attracted to highly attentive girls.
if he said "i never had sex with his wife.", believe him.
he might love being around you.
sex with someone you care about deeply is making love.
i am tired of men not acting their age.
first, you should use the word fuck, not copulate.
try to speak english properly without adding slang, find a job, take care of yourself, buy a car, and look your best.
i prefer to say it on the phone because you cannot get hit that way.
if you do not know what one is then you have not had one, but you will know it when you have!
in her state, you need to be 18 years old, so just stay friends for now.
dating is not that hard, but rejection can be so do not take it personally.
if you do not like her, it is right to let her know that.
leave him, you are your own person.
you will wonder why, but it is the truth.
that is the most attractive piece of clothing on the planet.
i have two words to say to you, tough love.
a lot of practice and a case of mono.
there is nothing you can do.
so first off, take a step back and think about how long you will be married to this guy.
hey, you cannot change someone that does not want to change.
if they do enough things, then you won't be in love with them any more.
just like with all men, they have some that are sweet and some that are jacka**es.
it should not be important to him.
it is time to live the life of a married person!
if he responds and then begins to flirt, you could make the assumption he is interested in other people as well.
ensure him that they are friends and nothing more than friends.
i will admit that i was inebriated that evening.
there is a great chance that she has already heard that.
it is a shame that they are like that.
but, he is getting married this month.
why are women not able to just tell us that they like us?
be safe, but be sure to watch out for naughty boys.
as time passed by, she advised that it was a good thing she did not ask.
it may not be true that he likes you. however, you should listen to what your heart is telling you.
i get a mushy feeling inside everytime he calls me by that name.
it appears that you are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
let's take a walk in the park. it is so cold that most people will stay home.
no freaking way,if i am not in that place in my life.
they get bored and find something better.
they can and it would be great if you remained that way.
first timers proceed with caution.
they probably like you if they look at you.
a woman possesses something called an egg.
here are some useful items form you, i hope they help you.
try different positions, consider role playing and some ludicrous experiences.
i am confident i am heterosexual, but i am attracted to the feel and look.
and the best question yet, who is that?
my mother's birthday is upon us.
he could maybe be trying to give you some space.
by the way i am in college, and i am 19 years old.
tell my why, come on it shouldn't be that hard.
inquire and see if he is responsive.
increased proximity of time will result in a lower emotional burden.
are you inquiring as to how to incite arousal?
being in a committed relationship is not required to have a satisfying life.
you just seem irresponsible at the point.
yes, this is the 2nd new girlfriend, she is two years older.
she has to be at least a 7.5-9.5 unless i really like her.
if your parents don't like your boyfriend, they probably have a good reason for it.
we both agreed that she wouldn't see or hangout with her friends until the first of march.
you are never aware  of thier true identity.
i did this  recently and i found it to be the most enjoyable.
excuse me, do try not to let your fears exceed a reasonable amount.
it occurs usually at the school. that is how i located my former lover.
this situation will be much easier if he does that.
yes, and that is increasingly the case if they are beautiful in addition to other qualities.
turn them prone and pull their hair. additionally, a light slap on the posterior may be helpful.
what are the qualities women first notice
if you suspect it, then most likely he does.
anyone can be very attractive and yet be a failure.
honestly i would have to say it may sound bad but let's deal with it.
no matter where you go believe me you will see a handsome man.
is there anything else that i can help you with?
sugar in the gas tank, or glue his penis to his stomach with super-glue.
ask him if you would like to be friends.
my dad advises that it is not worth the wait until you are much older.
good luck attempting to complete that task.
what you need to do is hire an attorney
i say, if you love her then there is nothing wrong.
even if you are 21, dad always knows what is best.
the list goes on.
oh that's my cousin, her nick name is her.
i mean you are really into him!
i like to make friend with her.
first a question for you. how old are you?
send him a query first, then decide to advance to a further rank.
if otherwise, it is rather unreasonable for you to ask her to refuse refreshment.
perhaps a massage would be of use in the calming of her nerves, prior to her participation in the act of procreation.
if it is necessary to inquire, then love is not present.
my name is joshua, and i am based in nigeria.
i married when i was 22 years old, and i am happy that i did so.
it is up to you, whether you want to do it or no.
i am one of them, and i can say that it is fun!
i can't believe you have no one close to talk to this about, how would you feel if you were in the same position?
thank you, i needed that laugh.
my boyfriend said that he really likes kissing me.
take a trip to africa, be polite, be prosperous and purchase one.
she apologized to me and stated how much she loved and missed me.
there has to be evidence if you want a divorce.
and you get half of everything that he has.
when you think of him and start to have feelings for him again, remember those things.
if she has been responsible with it, i do not see why not.
i do not know what to say in this box other than goodbye.
please get over it, he doesn't love you.
people laugh at his dumb jokes because he is a class clown.
but, you will most like remember this girl for the rest of your life.
excitement and fantasy are all nonsense. the truth is, he is bored.
if you are seeking attention and he is not giving it to you, then you might need to seek out a new man.
shee is still very young and there will be time for her.
what happened was, i encountered the person she was dating and proceeded to physically register my displeasure.
a locale where scantily-clad females perform
they were introduced via the internet.
you would not want him to die before your children go to college.
my boyfriend just ended our relationship.
and to forget about ever being with him at all.
i said it wrong and that is the understatement of the year. you are very hot and attractive.
believe me you are young and not all men do such things.
no matter what you do, do not brag to your friend. you will eventually be ditched.
give him the best time in his life.
she used protection. additionally, she is tested.
try it, honey. she may be just waiting for you. you will not be wrong if you try. go for it!
i really like the man, i am going to name him joe.
if you like that person so much then don't worry about what people will say.
i just enrolled into this new high school, and i am really shy.
honey, aren't you a little young to be getting married now?
many will try to tell you it isn't a big deal, most likely because they are no longer virgins.
i think she certainly summed it up right there.
the only reason you would not have sex with her is that you would get fired.
first of all, are you a guy or girl?
look your best and go out in the world.
you might, and you might not.
they will come to you then.
what are a few ways to spice up my relationship?
persuade him to have crazy intercourse, and show him what you've got.
if you try to rush him, that could push him away, be careful.
do your own detective work, or hire detective to do the work.
although the more elderly women will not mind if you tell them that.
and my parents really did not like that.
no one is young or old enough to be in love, but my dear, you are much too young to be married, please trust me.
the wife unless you truly have some things or unless she does not contest the divorce.
he is a year older than me.
i am not sure, but, it may be 18.
no matter what, she will either find out, or she will see the truth in your eyes.
if she was a real friend, she should understand.
if nothing is downloaded, it is probably her realizing that fart does stink.
he seems like he is a bit disturbed,  run away fast!
why are you trying to changes someone?  this is not your responsibility.
the best thing a husband can hope for from his wife is that she does not do a lot of shopping.
you should give a plant in a container that he likes such as a car or a beer can.
guys also do it, it is not limited to being only women that do.
tell him to close his eyes and describe you!
what was a really cool way in which you met someone special?
ask him if he loves you or that gold digger; tell your niece that.
and in the end, just say, "hope to see you again."
it is not a healthy for any relationship, the foundation with crumble sooner or later.
it is not bad as long as it isn't your mom or dad.
if not, you just might be too young.
be careful about which men you choose.
i was 13 years old, and it was the worst day of my life.
why is it that you think you once loved him?
be sure not to be too extravagant or you might frighten him away.
or i suppose i could pay around 200 rupess in front of palakha.
unless of course you want to marry them merely to enhance some aspect of your life.
in that case, you could ask him a question such as "what would you think if i had a boyfriend?"
i want a walk in the park.
he said he was interested in me.
i have tried to tell them, but they will not listen.
how long after the first date should i contact them?
i stared at her and sometimes she would catch me.
it has been months. if you want to keep the fire going then you need to feed it.
however, he is not there yet: he is not in a place where he is ready to fully commit yet.
it doesn't matter what anybody on here tells you.
one thing i like about women is their lips.
you'll need to do some serious soul-searching.
i suggest telling her she needs to wait a few years.
say "i care about my boyfriend".
avoid self-help books at all costs.
i despise the fact that people are attempting to tell me what to do.
either all of the good ones are taken or i can not locate one.
i believe we all have bad days, but you have to persevere not to let the negative days bring you down.
i hope women with that mindset will not lose hope.
thank him for his concern, but he can not tell me what to do.
don't be afraid to express to him your true feelings.
do you want to be with him? you should tell him and his friends that he doesn't have control over you.
look her in the eyes, and tell her how you are feeling.
you should show them a couple of bucks and then tell them how they can earn that money.
girls kick guys in the balls because they want to hurt men.
who's name is it in?
do they use the same method as us?
have confidence, and believe in yourself.
i'm not the most interesting guy.
the men were so nice to me.
if he is being unfaithful to you then you should separate from him.
if you simply flirt with her then she will realize your intentions.
but, if he does notice, tell him the way you feel about him and the way you feel about pool.
i like the actress, jessica alba. however, i would never be unfaithful to the girl i love.
the thing that matters most is that you are going to be happy with that guy.
i can see myself in them, that's why.
dump him, and then take care of yourself.
women can chase after me all they want.
i hope that it all works out for you!
god was up in heaven smoking weed when he created them, please forgive me god.
you ask her do unreasonable things and then become upset when she refuses to do them.
not a chance, sir, none at all.
(i am aware that my mother died.)
the best option is to avoid prolonging the matter and giving her the impression that you are interested.
yes, never allow anyone to hold you hostage in such a manner.
you're not going to have a good time if he's always angry.
it sounds to me that all he wants is sex and all you want is love.
i am not a doctor! you should go and find somebody that is and get that checked out!
it's something everybody does and you shouldn't worry about it.
i am with your boyfriend or girlfriend. i have no clue which gender they are.
if you do it without parental permission, it is against the law.
if you were to pursue this option, what could go wrong?
not all women are decent human beings.
although the relationship eventually dissolved, i was very fond of all four of the women.
if you see a kind woman, that is a good location, you can meet her there. i wish you the best.
sorry, that is just the ways that things worked out.
get over it, move on and never cheat again.
i also have the same problem.  can you please help me?
does it look like a circumcised penis?
he will come when he sees that you do not care about him.
i'm currently 18, and i would like to get married right now.
if he likes me, i just hate being nagged as soon as get home from work.
this is where shower sex comes into play.
if you think there is a possibility from what you can tell, then get out as soon as you can!
humans were not created that way, they are meant to be with only one person.
do not go look for the guy.
please wait until you are sixteen years old to have a relationship.
make her feel wanted by hugging and kissing her.
when your man smells like another woman's sex, he may be cheating.
i do not care if he is a movie star.
flirt with him and see how he reacts.
i am not a violent person; i do not even spank my kids.
she does not look too bad and gave you kisses and hugs!
girls are like flowers: treat them nicely, and you get it in return.
i stopped looking at her myspace page. (i do not want to stalk her.)
i like facial hair on a man.
ask him if he is interested in you.
what women do not have that men most likely do have.
yes, i would date her.
i would like to go to bed with you.
you will survive, but if you love this person enough you should try to fix your relationship with him or her.
this person is eighteen years old, works at a liquor store, and has a strict grandmother whose wishes must be respected.
tell her not to be afraid to do it, but the truth hurts.
outside the door or outside the window?
if he has not asked you yet, then he is probably not ready.
the girl above us just said exactly what i planned to say!
i believe if something is done once it can be done again!
what makes a girl appealing is large breasts and a large amount of cash!
i think the best choice for a gift is something she likes a lot may be her favorite animal?
the amount isn't the most important thing to focus on.
are you simply not observing others or is it an additional complexity?
you have engaged with the channel of nature; yet the correct channel is that of love and romance.
questions with a more recent time stamp are frequent with a higher volume on yahoo!
therefore, if we descend into chaos occasionally, simply recall that coco is the female companion.
let your eyes descend and protect your modesty.
everything is not as it seems.
goodbye and may god bless you.
being intimate with my girlfriend is one of the best things in life.
does he care about you enough that he will stay with you?
god is always with you and will always provide an answer.
you should not care what they thing, just show them your true beauty.
no, i do not know what you mean.
i just had to get to know him more before i could accept my own feelings.
if i could, i would do it 2-3 times a day.
how can i find her?
should i go out with her?
he will pursue you, it isn't the other way around.
second, only seven? that isn't a lot these days.
how many times will this question be addressed?
as they say, once a cheater, always a cheater.
you should talk to him.
some women act strangely after you say you love her.
do not ask him for a list of things to do.
when i have not seen someone in a long time i forget about them.
you should go outside in your underwear.
perhaps they were only pop-up advertisements or something similar.
she is free of disease but she has had sexual relationships with seven men.
it used to be an activity that men engaged in.
proceed with whatever your heart tells you to do.
are you attracted to african-american men?
i am single, and i am open to suggestions.
i have some ideas, but what are some of yours?
go see other people, like friends and family. if you are ready to go on dates, you could try that as well.
there is no way she is merely average-looking! women are all beautiful.
after some experience, i have decided that i would like cultural interaction in my marriage.
obviously, you have strong feeling for this man!
i am friends with his girlfriend.
why answer a question that already has the answer in it?
because, you are to good to be true.
hang out with his friends, so he gets to know you better.
use some thermite, homemade preferably, and use it on the hood of your car.
we are both redheads so i'm going to need some help.
i do like that idea.
be assertive with him and tell him what you are going to do. you do not need to ask his permission.
i told the first person that i knew.
if that doesn't work in a mont or two, leave him, he isn't worth it.
why are you going out with this girl if you don't actually like her?
as they always say, once a cheater, always a cheater!
have some drinks with him and then ask him bluntly, most men won't remember what embarrassing things they said when they sober up.
always do what your parents tell you!
she should have good manners.
try and find a single girl.
if you're not very serious, just get him something he would like.
i have learned why i am divorced; why men do not like my life style.
if you are enamored of her and she of you, then by all means, set a date to see her.
returning to the matter being discussed, my advice is to prepare for the expected and unexpected.
my friend, you should consider looking elsewhere for male companionship, this gentleman is not benefiting you.
it is best to continue your current course.
banknotes are not equal to the amount of stress they cause.
all other people commenting, aside from the two above mine, are correct.
would to like to make an error?
it does not mean that i do not love vanilla.
talk to him and determine if you have any similar interests and be flirtatious.
they were jumped and called a derogatory term.
men act like children.
like las vegas, it is all fake.
red roses are a great way to win over a woman.
to make friends, all you have to do is go out and keep trying.
b wants me to be his girlfriend but he's taking his time asking.
there is someone out there for you. don't look for  them and just enjoy your life. they will find you!
it depends on if you have a very hairy butt. if you do wax otherwise don't.
sometimes i wish i could just slap those flipping b*itches!
you don't want anyone who is ugly either.
is everyone else still friends?
good luck with everything and god bless you!
i like a flat stomach, but not very muscular.
i can't understand the language.
i haven't seen him in 12 years.
how can a man tell that a woman is interested in him?
whatever it was, write those thoughts down.
it was an utter betrayal, and then she woke up!
a month later the cops were getting involved, and that's when she told me.
what? it happens to men as well!
i do not like sweets, such as muffins or pumpkins.
she will forgive you, but not forget, if she does love you.
people of questionalbe morals and miscreants are often one in the same.
young men do not always have a lady's best interest in mind.
i can differentiate the visual differences between the two, but it is not important.
can you message my screen name, luapro77?
i'm testing if anyone else loves me as much
if he's cheating why are you trying to spice things up?
two mice at the same time is incredible.
i hope you find your answer soon.
i think she likes me.
now you realize how much you like men.
was i mistaken when i thought i had your heart?
you can remain unmarried.
one thought to remember is that no two people are the same.
you have time enough.
anytime my friend is attracted to someone she acts without restraint, even if the person is not attracted to her.
simple suggest that he appears to like you, and you were curious because you like him, then go from there.
i am 40 years old and my girlfriend asks me all the time why i am not married yet.
i have a friend who is 23 years old, and they are still a virgin.
stand up for him, and it you have a bad break up with him you can alway make fun of his nose.
the other sites were slow and lacking.
if you only knew her for a short time and then cheated on her, i don't think she will forgive you.
if he does not do anything for you, leave him. no man should treat any woman that way.
in my opinion, no one is ever good enough for her daughter.
i think it is their greatest asset.
if there are no kings, they will never be married.
just the idea of getting a brazillian wax is frightening.
i understand your pain--my grandmother died when i was six--but you should not lie about it!
i do not know if you will get that, but yes.
i do not know--it is just not a good color.
do not ever limit your success or happiness to the past or even to the present.
give her this link and let her read it.
try them in a very serious situation such as times of death, diseases or poverty.
my friend, you will have a new girlfriend and lose your virginity sooner than you realize,
tell him to spend time on more important pursuits.
one idea is that you could simply say it directly. otherwise,  you could hold hands and approach it more gently.
for most men, taking their shirt off.
i would never be effective for me but it is so cliche that one feels compelled to laugh.
i am not alone on this planet.
you are the head rather than the tale.
for the most part, i do not look because i am blind.
i recommend visiting barnes and nobel because they have some helpful books on the subject.
you should enjoy intimate kissing, but you are not competing for any kind of world record.
it is also ok if you are trying to pick up a man.
the age of thirteen is far too young to be concerned with adult relationships.
set it then keep your hands off of it.
you cannot always help what you dream about, so do not worry.
it is like cuddling and similar activities.
it is because you are the best a man can get.
get a backbone, and send the foreign guy packing.
she does not like fancy stuff like perfumes and lipstick.
i will find a way to talk to her because i think we could become friends.
if he moved we can have a a party and invite some of his friends and some of your friends.
can you explain why you want him back?
i do not believe he will think you are bad woman.
if you told him you did not want him to play sports do you believe he quit at your request?
pick the mattress up and then he will have to find somewhere else to be lazy.
if it is meant to be, then it will be.
yes, but you will never find them.
i am a virgin because i do not want to be accounted for wrong decisions, stereotyped, and i also do not give into temptation.
this is untrue, and who are you again?
i read this on the internet, it could work for either gender.
good luck and have fun with it, most importantly be creative.
i do not know, maybe my girlfriend is cheating on me?
it means he likes you because i have done that myself.
i think he accidentally got a new female friend.
a good type of kiss inside of the mouth with your tongue for a long period of time.
you will get married without even thinking about it.
it would be a good idea to find a job and then a girlfriend.
please be nice and free of judgment, as i am sure you would prefer others to be to you.
not all girls are about looks like men are, so it should be fine.
it just gets easy enough to tolerate it.
red hair looks funky.
do not give up on you friends, any of them whether female or male for the person you're dating.
ask him if he would like to go on a date somewhere fun.
kuwait is not the country where i live.
why don't you make plans to see a movie or just leave the house?
you could ask her questions about herself.
if he is not willing to take your feelings into consideration, you are not important to him.
when i fall in love i get very happy.
my grandmother is strict, and i have to listen to her.
you should give her some time and see how things go from there.
in time you will find an even better guy who will want to be with you.
have you niece ask him if he and the girl are still in a relationship.
no, it doesn't hurt them at all.
i think that you need to have sex or something.
that will catch the heart of every latino man i know.
i loved the price of the invitations.

please attend the pelvic area.
once you have done that decide if he has changed.
i am a man.
be yourself and do not worry.
you should tell her that her best friend does not have good morals.
unless you were separated and in the end it wasn't anyone's fault.

ensure that you are not being selfish.
i do not agree with my best friend of nearly six years.
how can you have no chance?
i would enjoy it greatly and if you would like to telephone me my number is 09871985706.
it could be he is not interested in you anymore
i like to show off my body
if you kiss him he will notice you

we both have to work on things.
we think we are very good at it.
teach me about men. they are so complex
i'm not sure, he may have just gotten bored.

my reasoning is that we do not need them to be trained to disagree with us.
you should wait until he is ready to ask you.
no, it is not wrong at all!
take a chance.  all she can say is no.
if it is his only one, you are out of luck.
can i buy you a drink or do you prefer money?
i would not worry about it yet.
date other people, and work on yourself, you're your top priority.
love is an emotion not an attraction, at the end of the day you love who is best for you.

i am a person that truly loves with all my heart
i love my boyfriend so much
i don't think i have ever been in love
that is not right, the answer master has the correct answer
go get a rubber ball and let's get this game started!
you're a little young to be dating, don't you think?
i have to ask, why date someone at your age?
twelve is far too young to be dating.
if you think he is cheating, he probably is.
he called 24/7, and visit everyday.
laugh it off and say, whoever the guy is . hes lucky.
if you just be yourself and have a good personality, then finding a decent girl will be no problem.
anything is possible in love and war
im 18 and addicted. i lost it in march when i turned 18.
to start, ask her if she likes you.
time is forever. and you want to spend forever with him, right?
remember that jesus was a virgin.
but here is some great advice to help you find your purpose. i am sure it will help.
certainly not. obviously you do not care for or love her, so why cheat?
however, be sure he is a nice person and you love him.
additionally, stop going for walks in her company.
i can emphasize with the difficulty in moving on from that type of situation.
if i am able to provide advice to you.
i am not being serious as that has never been successful for me, actually only time and affection from another person will heal a broken heart.
date, if you really want to learn.
make that two hundred boys.
no matter what rachel,we will always be friends.
beforehand, my guy mentioned that it was embarrassing to him.
i have thrown up in class.
i plan on getting some cologne or silk boxers for my boyfriend.
yes. that is correct, so let it happen.
i do not want to hurt your feelings or make you feel like i am against you, but it would be beneficial for you to stop engaging in activities like that.
first you need to engage her in flirty conversation, and then you need to ask for her email.  once you have the email, you can tell her your thoughts.
i am thinking about ending my relationship with him and would appreciate your help.
my boyfriend has called my "baby", and "honey", for the past 6 years.
are you not going to go out with me?
get a fishing pool, and a ticket for a great fishing spot.
it is on the internet and on the radio.
of course, you aren
go to a disco, and you will find a lot of them that will want to have sex with you.
you might be allergic to latex condoms or the spermicide.
you can't force her to forgive you if she is upset.
just don't give up, and try to remain strong.
he's really shy, i've known him for almost 3 years.
am i overreacting or something?
certainly not, i go out with many friends, but i don't consider myself as one who dates an excessive number of men.
with a sexy tone, "good luck".
he obviously does not love if you if he is having infidelities.
enjoy it as often as you can.
what will i do if it happens again?
there are only two times that i want to be with you and they are now and forever.
i noticed that girls also "check out", just like guys do.
what sort of things does she like?
you are on the wrong site.
if you give it some time, you will find her.
i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want this in my marriage.
perhaps visit the gym and gain some muscle mass.
you could tell her that you are not interested in ruining your marriage, life, family, kids, and reputation.
i said no, as in i do not love you.
always; which is why it does not matter how bad it gets, keep in mind that, "this too shall pass!"
who says brainy women are not pretty?
other than that, maybe they just really do not feel loved.
his voice gets softer whenever you two talk.
as for me, i like chatting with any guy on the internet; what is your email?
it is nice to believe that appearance does not matter, but it most certainly does.
why you do not stop talking and be silent.
we have tried counseling, but the counseling did not work because, for one, we did not finish it.
it all depends on the situation, but i guess i would say that honesty is always the best policy!
smile and allow her to talk first.
when you do find her, do not mess things up!
i may be a little overprotective, but god, if she is already acting that way at the age of five i will go ballistic.
but sometimes men can be foolish and shy.
i need one, too, but it will not come from sitting down. go out and have fun!
fat people make me nauseous. i would never date a fat person.
i have no idea if i should stop being more than a friend to her or fight for her.
let him make the first move because it is more romantic and you are not too young to kiss.
i found some lip stick in the vehicle.
the best way to propose to your girlfriend is to ask her to marry you.
i finally gave in because i was tired of him.
i've heard that there is someone for each of us.
i believe that you should follow your heart.
i prefer 18 and up, but you will know when you are ready.
thin is the fashion, so choose the skinny one.
although there are no rules in bed, you should give each other the freedom each deserves and keep very good communication.
yes, i did enjoy an evening with him.
i am a black woman who loves my black man very much.
or, performing sexual relations with a person but only one of them achieves orgasm. i do not consider this sex, i consider this making out.
so, you should ask your own friends how to find woman who are available to date.
i suggest you tell him. you will never know, it is possible he might want you to.
i was curious as to how old her boyfriend is, is he the same age?
it would take too long, most likely two mounts, so try your best!
that means 1 in 4 men will not cheat on their partners.
would you like some meat?
maybe you should ask her?
however, a decent guy would not mind.
if you are asking this question, maybe you are a bit too young to know the answer.
because men are swine, performance and physical attractiveness are the only words in their dating rule book.
get out of the house.
if she says no, then respect her reasons and do not push.
if she does, do you really want that kind of woman in your life?
yes, some of the best tricks out there.
i'm not saying other races are not, i'm saying from my experience i find them that way.
why would he believe that of you and his best friend.
i am more interested in the relationship and getting to know my girl.
it is because many of you women allowed them to do so.
you need to tell your friend that you have feelings for her or stop having feelings for her.
no, because if they are in relationships then they must possess a noticeably attractive quality, do you understand?
they kissed for fifteen to twenty-five seconds, since it was new year's day. then they had coitus for close to an hour.
attempt to be single for some time. it will do you some good if you succeed.
is it possible to have sex with your clothes still on?
maybe this is because you are a virgin.
this is what you need to do, show him a little bit of your hips, and your thighs.
the experience was so eye opening!
i need a boy to tell me that he likes me.

follow through from your experience

my boyfriend and i fool around in his pool house because he has one in there.
you should honestly choose one woman and stick with her to avoid having a double life.
by the way, you are acting like an idiot!
that happened to me before!
you do not need a boyfriend when you are 12 years old, as that is rather young.
do not try to hard and just be yourself.
do not do it if the age difference bothers you.
furthermore, the reason is not because you want to be unfaithful to him, but that you crave for physical relations with other men.
i believe you need to date men similar to me.
now he wants to have us be married. i love him very much, should i trust him?
also, are you aware of any cute names for a baby?
you should tell him he will be a father, do not be naive.
give it a try, but do not get your hopes up.  good luck!
now all that remains is to get out of debt! (which we are slowly doing.)
he obviously loves his wife and has no plans to leave her.
the better we feel, the more we are loving it!
i do not like to chat, because i would rather get down to business.
leave him to be alone for some time and watch what develops.
if you intend to be unfaithful, then end the relationship. it will not improve.
a lot of coitus, good fellatio, and no complaints.
no, you utilize what you have. some men like small breasts.
nothing is happening between us anymore. i believe it is because we are both reserved. i am very confused.
she must need a boyfriend.
i would not be fair to your new love interest if you still wish to be romantically involved with your ex-boyfriend.
you should attempt to make him notice you and then let destiny determine your future.
women are never satisfied, never trustworthy and never accept the truth.
do not lie, for lying will only make the situation worse.
also, take their garbage outside.
trust me, for i am your faithful wise man.
try to make it work, but don't get overly attached.
if she says no, do not get discouraged, try again.
until you have fulfilled your career goals.
it is possible that this is the best thing that you have to offer.
you should practice with a lollipop.
if your boyfriend is married, you should leave him to be with his wife.
do you think that i am not sufficient for him, and that he is not afraid to lose me?
my boyfriend was doing the same thing, and i did not find out until almost two years later.
they are entertaining.
they want a wife who is attractive and good at sex.
since you two are friends, maybe she will understand your feelings.
shouldn't you be doing your homework?
yes i am 13, but she just wants to talk to people.
if you are aquainted well enough, you are familiar with what he likes.
if you are getting your penis damp through the mail then yes.
it may lead to love, but usually it does not.
a magical thing you can say to him: do not fret too much, simply, man
sledding, riding on horse back, and even visiting the local shooting range.
the only thing you should be careful of, is not to send an inappropriate message.
it goes on the left hand next to the pinky finger.
don't forget to confess your problem to him.
women want they don't have and could never have.
i think that you should ask him how he is doing.
if you are in love, don't deny it and work hard on your studies too.
handsome men can get away with that; so they do it.
if you are having problems and you two aren't patient, kind, and understanding with each other: then you are not in love.
because, you are still unmarried.
so everyone is happy and loving it.
this is the present, not future or the past.
some girls move faster then others.
if you care, you will talk to her about it first.
of course, after long hugs and kisses, it will be a day he will never forget.
compose a letter and state that you do not want him to contact you again.
i don't get why anyone would find her attractive.
this is the best way to see if my family likes my new guy.
now that is a good question.
this is the most fub i've had on the internet.
you  have to decide whether your friend or this guy is more important to you.
i feel nervous and nauseous whenever i see her around school.
go out, have fun, and learn about different people.
right before he went in, he cheated on me.
you will eventually want to do it, but do not.
that means there is no way she does not know that you are still alive.
you ought to wait until you are both in love or married. it only now occurred to me to ask: how old are you?
it seems that you have already resolved this. or have you?
it is dependent on how attractive the person is.
how old are you, if you do not mind the question?
simply say hello, acknowledge that you like her and then become acquainted with her.
if you and she went out, would you be untroubled?
this is an acronym, not a quotation.
the word "swimming" contains the letter 'm' whereas "swinging" contains the letters 'ng.
in the event you are an opportunist and wanted a rich woman, then you must do foxy little works.
my answer to you is; if you are uncertain you would want something done to yourself, refrain from doing it to his spouse.

i would not, however, marry a woman who woud not adopt my surname.
i am indifferent to whether anyone approves of me.
as was said previously, upon what does it depend?
you are in an endangered position.
why would you want a relationship with a man who is going to injure your feelings?
that is saying that all women are after money.
my boyfriend spends his free time playing sports instead of spending it with me.
for four years i had a male best friend.

it is not going to hurt anyone right now, but later it may be a problem.
i am romantically attracted to a man from a different state so how can i invite his company with finesse?

twirl your hair between your fingers.
it is easy to forgive, harder to forget.
that is what intercourse was before the media began trifling with it.
and, if he believes that you are a moron for that, you are wasting your time.
i am not in "olve" or "olive" with him as you state, but i am in love with him.
i believe that it is quite beneficial.
i believe that you ought to at least endeavor towards it as a companion then see where it goes from there.
my husband is similar to most of the men he works with.

i want to express to you that we can always be friends.
after he speaks with the girls, make sure you can read the conversation.

i do no know what else to say. i am sorry.
even if they will not admit it to their friends.
i tried to let go but it did not work, i am so in love with her.

if that does not work, then you need to show her who is the boss.

he will come back, but he may leave you again.
you must always be yourself and love yourself first.
offer her advice and subtly tell her how you feel bout her.

you need to motivate him without him realizing what you are doing.
i am sorry, but there is no other way.
roomba, he may want something romantic but i believe he will want something better.
while it is not unethical, it is certainly politically correct.
i have no idea what my next step is.

first, it is him controlling you, next it is him using you.
i am twenty-one and consider myself to be attractive.
please do not do it and run away instead.
i am familiar with the awful feeling of having an unfaithful partner.
women allow men to engage in sexual acts with other women.
i desire a close friendship or relationship of that nature so do not make those sorts of statements.

sex is best when it is a fair exchange.
if the girl is larger, it will not be as bad.

well, if you don't know i can't tell you.
pay attention to her, tell her she is pretty an be nice too her.
just give it time.
some people are only nice while they need you.
it will hurt the 1st few times.
you should only do that if you are having sex with your mother.
first it is just sex but then they move on to a true relationship.
you should use a pleasure toy.
he will screw things up.
if you get scared, you can try this during the scary parts.
i love my girlfriend, ashley, and i think of her every night.
just because you encounter some self-centered men does not mean all men are like that.
letting a man know you love him can make him feel as good as making love to him.
is that something you agree with?
i do not. why watch this when you can have the same thing in real life?
where does she enjoy visiting?
in regards to popular opinion, do women lie when discuss love?
everything is okay mother, please go ahead with your decisions.
there was one time i remember when my sister gave a man her cell phone number who she had just met.
perform an action that will attract her to approach you.
then, you ought to decide or, at least, it shall provide for an easier decision.
frankly, i attempted to cease favoring him because no male is worth losing a friendship, correct?
i would ask myself, though, "why can he not speak with me?"
i would most likely say, "sixteen and older," simply because anything younger is merely a fleeting fancy.
do not rush it.  wait until you find your true match.
this man seems pleasant based on what you have told me.  i think you should stay with him.
the coach was very different.
enjoy yourself, but make sure to practice safe sex.

start naming names (fictitious) or something.
he makes you feel so special and wanted.
take a break from him, at least temporarily.
try to step back and take a good look at this boyfriend.
give it a chance, sometimes you just need to take a leap of faith for love.
when it comes to looks, sometimes, but not everything else.
it involved silly string, we will just have to talk about that later.
tell her to not do it, they have no clue what they are doing if you understand what i am saying.
if you're an emotional person, i would recommend against it.
i feel that you have not found that special someone yet.
you do not have to.
if he likes her better than you, then he is not worth your time. you should find a new man.
be prepared to be incredibly disappointed.
find something that will elevate your boyfriend's position.
only the arrogant people who think themselves better than everyone else.
someone who would be great company.

if you are asking if she should move on now that her husband has committed adultery, my answer is yes.
if you date other men while you are dating your boyfriend and he doesn't know, that is still considered to be an affair.
are you aware that your female friend is interested in you?
my friend discovered her boyfriend was having an affair so kept an eye on him through his email account.
if you prefer to eat in, what would you like to eat for supper.
i will go out with him again if he isn't creepy.
your friend's wife enjoys pleasurable experiences.
can you please ask him why he is speaking this way?
i dated a woman who was almost 300 pounds.
i do not want to be perceived as a jerk.
learn to put that into words!
it is not uncommon for a girl to watch pornography.
go back to rocking quietly in your seat.
if that person what truely your friend you would never have done what you did.
men like women for their humor, simplicity and intelligence.
if you were in your dad's shoes, you would.
take a break in between dating to heal.
maybe that girl was his other girlfriend, i am not sure although i broke up with him too.
you will know when you are in love with him.
perhaps you should open the car door for her.
if what they say is true, then to know me is to love me.
trust me, the man will not mind.
the most important thing that partners can do to make their marriage work is to communicate with your spouse.
do no ask her friends if she is cheating on you because that is not very nice.
that is just a little advice to help you.
they are desperate and appear to have no other interests in life.
since she has expressed her love for you, it is apparent you both want to be married.
he has deceived you once before, which leads one to believe, he will do it again.
he is your friend and will forever be your friend, which proves he will never turn.
the alternate story may be the better choice.
do this because of the right reasons, because you like them.
if this love was meant to be, tell him and you may have more of a chance at staying together.
in my opinion, it is not possible to have deep feelings for someone you barely know.
say something nice about the person other than their body.
they want to feel at ease and relaxed while talking with that person.
keep an eye on him and pay attention to his demeanor.
i had the same thing happen to me!
no way! i once dated a guy that bought me face wash for christmas!
whether you should or not is entirely up to you.
i believe that is why some guys like me.
you should talk to her because she probably likes you, too.
if you continue to think about her, it will only make things worse.
you may not know what you are doing because you are probably new to this.
how can i shake her off?
i am man and all i want is sex.
how do i ask a man out if i am shy?
i guess it is okay for the person that actually wants to date him.
it sounds to me as if you're trying to take some sort of revenge.
your heart will tell you.
you should tell her how you feel.
explore your surroundings.
my bestfriend is a transgender, and i'm fine with it.
people always want things that they cannot obtain.
he will not perform.
if i find his hair and eyes attractive, i will act foolishly.
you should call the police and report your stolen boyfriend.
that is where we learn about sex.
i know where to find one that is great!
i look at him and decide whether or not i want to sleep with him.
can he take viagra or some other drug for his erectile dysfunction.
just give him a punch in the face.
i could do this to you right now and i really would love to try it.
i told the man to calm down and perhaps you should do that, too!
find a new love or hobbie to mingle.
it looks like gimpy has you beat, although it is difficult dating women online and having them not show up.
you all might end up getting married one day.
take a deep breath and ask her on a date!
do not criticize him if he comes home late.
the only thing you can do is talk.
i am attracted to women who do not wear makeup.
you cannot do that when you are far apart.
an acquantance's friend told her boss that her friend was dating the boss's friend.
your former partner is no longer your partner.
it is not worth the hassle.
at a later time, you should make yourself available so he can discuss the right move with you.
you have not only lost a peer but also a potential love match.
don't let yourself get worked up over this.
it varies but most girls in the city are concerned with material posessions.
why is this questions under the topic of singles and dating?
who do you want to be with?
i was jealous of the girl that i introduced him to.
some women like skinny men, while others like heavier men.
you should meet and find someone that you can trust and be happy with.
do not be annoying.
if you are as much of a stud as you say you are, why do you need to resort to online dating?
it is their problem if they do not like it.
he is a nice gentleman.
you could either move on or stay with the girl.
if he can not adhere to your rules, i suggest you break off the relationship.
although the lie was minor, i don't think she appreciated it.
you can tell my his expression that he is not telling the truth!
if it happens again, ask him why is this woman so important to you?
you need to discuss this with him and let him know that what he said or did was unappreciated.
love is better than lust because you gain more from it.
if you are not exclusively dating someone, then have fun talking to, flirting with, and dating other people.
they say, "all is fair in love and war."
it depends on the catch because you will not be given fourteen million dollars for doing nothing.
it is not your business, your daughter should be the one researching it.
so many men are similar in that way.
what would she do for you if you asked her to?
appropriate for your birthday as well as for others.
he will look to be sure you are near in his time of need.
i don't agree with many of her friends; never have and never will.
also, be careful what type of church you get into!
one of my friends hit on my ex the same night we broke up!
i have no idea what to say, or who to say it to.
time to let that go, my friend!
it might hurt, but you have to do what's best for you.
the rush of emotions come and go.
i would even if i had to brutally murder somone and their family.
it really depends on how he is.
we just have to learn how to choose the keepers before we go home with them!
do it secretly like many others.
in revenge of the nerds,the main character marries a really beautiful woman.
you know i am just a dog.
i love you said to often loses meaning.
if it is only talk and nothing sexual,i would not worry.
you should give her space.
not to be overly direct, but spend a lot of time tying your shoes!
it is cheaper to run your own through paper work and through the mail.
once i dated four women at the same time for a few weeks and it nearly killed me.
you will definitely find that i am a sweet person.
no matter what their hair color is, a pretty woman will still be pretty.
the only thing that you can tell by his looks, is that he is hot amd that you want him!
if a man outs his hands on you once, do not think for a second that he will not do it again.
no, it is called: is she really going out with him?!
i was born at night, but, certainly not last night!
just tell her that maybe someone is waiting for her,  or more fit for her than this guy.
perhaps you think they are in love, but it is unlikely.
you may want to reconsider your opinion on this subject.
please give us another chance.
it is difficult but sometimes it is necessary.
get her permission before using your lips.
i wish i could get a man to watch "brokeback mountain" with me!
oh, yes, i don't want him to think i am frigid!
first ask him if he likes you. then, go from there!
i don't know what i'd do if i were in her position.
yes but it would be tough.
i have when i was younger but have you?
you obviously don't know the difference between they're, their an there so it is definitely a no.
it will be okay, just hang in there.
your boyfriend loves you an you don't love him? damn you seem cold hearted. just kidding.
they can, this is the only reason they need, and there are sufficient numbers of willing women.
i attempted it and it worked very well.
hey may not enjoy chocolates or teddy bears, therefore provide him with extensive sexual activity.
it rarely functions in the intended manner.
i nearly forget to mention flowers and the censored portion hides the word "dildo."
aren't you on thin ice here princess?
gee, i'm glad i don't fit in that category!
sometimes it works but sooner or later the stat acting imamature.
doggie style or on your side?
move on the is somebody out there 10 times better!
perhaps the two of you are too young.
my ex-partner did not, however, i believe they can. it all depends.
you will not know unless they tell you!
i find that "roofies", a date-rape pill, work best for me.
god willing, he will be there for you. if he isn't, then you have a better idea of what you should do.
it is possible though there are some money problems.
the suspicion is a problem all on its own.
he is not really old enough to have one, but i'll share the information with you anyway.
that is a negative, men who lie to you are simply cheaters.
i don't believe that is a good idea due to the fact that people will question it.
it's incorrect; you can't trust anyone in this matter.
so you know what some people want.
why would he break up with someone he really likes?
do you like working with little kids?
just don't show that you're better than he is!
after you have sex, it is going to hurt.
do you surround yourself with muslim friends?
you must be aware of your circumstances and goals, and persist in you plans.
his appearance will become appealing to you.
it would not be good for you.
maybe when god was passing out private parts, he ran out and gave you what was left.
yes, when i was a baby.
the one with a good head on his shoulders.
maybe you should talk to him and tell him how much you use to enjoy it.
i do not want to be alone for the rest of my life, i need some good advice.
you can do what you want and have some fun when you are single.
if they do not say hello, do not feel bad.
i am very glad you are not my friend.
what i mean is, he is falling for you and then you are falling for him.
don't speak negatively in the situation, it will come back around and damage you.
my spouse admits to performing sexual acts when she was younger.
i wasn't serious, but how can one accurately describe love?
it seems you have gained much notoriety now.
it will take time because love doesn't happen overnight.
i then was able to gain confidence. i once again learned proper manners, and went on a few dates with other men.
then run away and have a good life with him.
do you have any thoughts on what this dream may mean?
pleasuring yourself by touching your genitals until you reach orgasm.
you should ask them if you do not wish to hurt their feelings.
i think it said $500.  it was nice to see how accurate it was.
you do not need that.
you cannot always hate them.
you should show him how much he means to you.
if he leaves you, will you wonder what could have happened?
the one thing not to forget:  people do change.
that is why i do not have a lover.
this will work most of the time.
of course, no one knows, but here is an idea.  simply go and ask her!
maybe, once the tax period is over.
it could be, you never know what could be going through our minds.
it is a complex question, go here to read about why i think it is so.
when you are trying to be close to someone.
you have never had sex, you are underage.
you were not wrong at all, if you do not want to, then do not do it.
go some place like a starbucks where you can actually talk and laugh.
i did that when i was aged 10 1/2.
i know how hard it can be!
and you can see whether you can meet some of the sons of your mother's or father's frinds.
if i am very sad, should i tell my friend how i am feeling?
in our daily life, we need to make choices that we don't know the outcome.
i really enjoy that song!
you should really enjoy the process of falling in love!
that really is a mood breaker for me.
have you been engaging in kissing women that you don't know?
if they get a job soon is fine even if they do not have one now.
that is the same problem i have with my ex boyfriend!
it is going to be hell for you both.
at the age of fourteen you are still to immature.
ninety nine percent of the time i give money.
due to ladies investing more in love and a relationship.
am i mistaken in feeling very angry due to a strong aversion to this?
i have the impression the lady is not interested.
she will come eventually.
neither, find a lady who has done it once or twice.
do not let your husband ruin the life of you and your baby.
i decline, unless you are old and rich.
the answer is no, but i am still curious.
you really do not have to tell her if you are already 21.
it is possible that he will get scared, and it would be awkward if it turns out that he does not have feelings for you.
i understand how you feel.
it happens in relationships.
no because you were not together at the time.
she did not do it on purpose.
seems like it is better for you to wait until your in love.
these things happen in relationships.
no, this is because you two were no longer in a relationship.
she did not wish for that to happen, but that is life!
you should go to a place where you can laugh and enjoy yourself.
what are some possible ways to ensure my boyfriend's happiness?
be self-assertive so that the man will be able to see that you are motivated.
i believe that is how they say that they like you.
i urge you to not waste your time and energy on him.
don't try just look for an older guy.
flirting is just fun and it doesn't necessarily mean anything.
you should not have to ask where baby's come from.
do a cross of sounding smart but actuang stupid as well.
it is best if you ask your northern that question.
has any other person previously done this deed or laid eyes on its execution?
perhaps you should consider adopting a child... or possibly a pet if that is more to your liking.
procure an attractive au pair and then escort your children to a matinee.
however, i do declare that it is primarily about sexual intercourse. please do not doubt my sincerity!
i have nothing against them, but i would refrain from picking them over someone else.
i probably would not have married him if i was not pregnant.
he used to cheat? as in more than one occurrence?
i am not being sarcastice, i am actually curious.
instead of flirting and behaving in a cool and interesting manner, they just act foolishly.
she goes on an anti-men website.
you should talk to your wife, but do not mess with her.
you should ask him out the next time you see him.
i will tell you after you do it with me.
i do not think you and your boyfriend are really fighting.
if you were not together, then it was not cheating.
leave him and his new girlfriend alone!
there are different types of hugs; gentle, strong and grabbing her butt.
the weather is so variable i can not imagine why you would put your friends and family through this.
i am a widow and am not looking forward to valentine's day.
go ahead and find a new boyfriend.
you need to have a good smile, women know when men are trying to sleep with us.
subtle ways, massage her hair or rub your hand along her leg.
they could break your heart without even trying.
you know this is bad news.
having a penis put into my pussy.
it could go the other way though.
if he closed the im quickly, he obviously has something to hide.
we've been together for 3 years and it's still great.
i hate the whole diva routine.
you should stop berating yourself over this.
what would you say about a man who has been separated from his wife for six years?
do you think that was short and to the point?
the reason is that it looks sick and disgusting.
i do love myself.
it depends, does he help out you and your children?
you merely have to forget about this misfit.
if you go see a movie you cannot do much more than sit and watch.
you need to take some time to examine your life and reclaim your identity.
when you want to kiss someone.
that is the best thing you can do.
just be honest with her, tell her to hold on, that you think she is nice and ask her out.
how should i approach and ask her next time?
ask her if she has a boyfriend or not, and if she does not, ask her if should would consider it.
you will just end up hurting her but you would not feel it with a pornstar.
choose the virgin, unless you prefer to injure people.
my experience occured at 11 with meredith, my love. i love her and am happily married to her.
perform your best with your current resources, there is nothing you can beyond that.
you must be using a bathroom on an airplane.
if you are able to locate one, inform me and hopefully we can connect and chat.
i know my wife reads the obnoxious comments i supply as answers.
you know you are not in need of details.
a kiss and a rose, my friend.
pursue him instead of losing him!
it is not being unfaithful if you were not in a relationship.
buy him a new vehicle if it is affordable.
i suggest you do not enter marriage immediately.
try to be yourself and do not be overly polite just to impress her.
you are still very young and may find it most difficult to raise a child.
one of them probably likes you, but if they do not, they would probably be too much of a burden on your time.
why not invite her out for coffee sometime?
i would never have sex with another man; i doubt i would watch brokeback mountain, either.
are you attracted to a man like that?
so. when the really important birthday arrives, what am i supposed to do?
i hope you receive the opportunity to experience it.
if you're being yourself, you'll find the right individual.
you never love anyone the same way twice.
must i be alone for eternity?
love is something i lost twenty six days ago.
be careful with women because sometimes they don
why would you want to be with him, after what you have said here?
tell your friends it is not funny and to stop.
you can set them up in dates, but it is up to your best friend.
give him those records, and then dump him!
you never know until you try.
if you honestly like him, then i say go for it.
that may just be me.
keeping busy is the best method.
should i worry, or should i just give up and let him work things out on his own?
i broke up with him on monday (the 23rd).
i prefer etneis or vans for boys to wear, i am a girl.
then you apply mr happy until the two of you have a happy finish.
i would hug you, but i don't believe it's possible to through the internet.
i learned what i did wrong, and where i went wrong, now we've resumed our relationship.
they cause us to have an erection.
join a club, take a class, etc.
natalie seems like the correct one.
i am sorry to say that you will never entice her to love you since she already has not loved you from the beginning.
do what is best for your child, if nothing else.
maybe so, but the reason could also be that she misses being around you.
certainly this is the time when i should explore the new corners and funs of life.
i honestly think that most couples do not register anymore because they would prefer cash.
no wait while you can because whenever you get attatched you are attatched.
if they do not come remember that it is their loss, not yours.
first, stop flirting, and then ask what his intentions are.
that is because they are still in school.
i am sorry for both of you.
this begs larger questions, such as, is your girlfriend really untrustworthy or are you just way too controlling?
i find it very childish, but the problem is that i love him so much.
no, because you two are not together anymore.
funny, caring, and good looking, someone who says i am pretty, not hot.
oh yes, latins are hot and as a lover, satisfy.
you mean b.o.b.: battery operated boyfriend.
evidently he falls really easy, but you have to be the judge of that one.
i do not like these questions.
you will enjoy it as much as he does.
what happens when men go hunting?
try something new, as i am implying.
ask her if she has considered how i feel.
to give him a foot massage, sit in front of him.
if the question you asked is in this section, you may be considered a stalker.
a woman would be crazy to email you, because what kind of man does that.
i liked you before we even went on a date.
you spent a day with another guy having intercourse.
please do not make the same mistake again.
however, i am an overweight and impolite lesbian.
i am simply not sure what it is that you are searching for here.
do not make false statements. tell the man that you are bored.
having money and a nice car do not hurt your chances!
knowing he loves you is a good thing.
it is good that he wants to spend time with you.
there is a cab around the corner waiting for you.
you do not know, he could be a weirdo or murderer.
i do not like olives.
that is quite repellent. i believe that it is not true love because it is flatulence.
there is one waiting for you shortly.
preposterous. you could truly be dating a menacing murderer!
i despise olives, but some men love them!
what if he gets mad and wants nothing to do with you?
it would be a good idea not to tease him.
in high school they are still acting like fools to get the attention of girls.
you called him a boy and i am guessing you already have the answer.
when you don't want one, you don't see the interests of others as well.
tell your family that you love them and be happy.
newer questions get more activity on yahoo!
do it like they do on the discovery channel.
yes, there would be no love without commitment.
darling, you are looking in all the wrong places because i am right here.
i asked, "what present should i give a guy?", both of the answers were oral sex.
if she says "no", then walk away.
what i would have given to be her thong.
nothing is worth taking your own life for it.
how the guy looks would not be a big deal, but his personality would matter .
you talk to him quite a bit.
it is not as if you slept with another man while you were still with him.
"ask" is not the best place to get this information.
that means staying only long enough to reel you back in!
and so my final answer would be a resounding "no".
some men are afraid, other men are involved in relationships.
young lady, i believ you need to stop, but that is my belief.
approach him and ask " do you still desire me, or is there someone else?".
if not, then sit down with him and discuss your feelings.
more than half of significant others find ways outside of copulation to satisfy themselves.
a good ride can last eight seconds.
further, this is a question you should pose to your friends.
i am of the opinion there is no time limit in love.
next year, he should be required to hire a sitter, and you can then take the children to a film.
some people must look out for their own interests, and he is one you should not help.
could he be serious? do not be blind by nice words, forever is a long time.
oysters and pumpkin seeds by the hand full.
i agree with sunflower, if you had wanted to be with him you would not have cheated.
do not wait until after, that would be rude.
his or your's i do not know.
a man's word indicates his character.
that'd be amusing, but the girl ought to be his fiancee.
he's only interested in carnal pleasures.
i feel that i am a good lover.
in truth, if this man cannot see how beautiful you are, then he is not worthy of you.
have you considered whether or not you truly like this man or if you merely want revenge?
i think he truly loves you now so when you are alone ask him or call him.
i once went on a date with a very attractive young woman.
you are your own woman. if he believes that is being unfaithful, then that is his loss.
it kind of sound like she wants you to make the decision.
i would probably recommend carnival cruise lines.
some women and men just like to flirt, i guess.
sorry, little guy, i feel bad for you.
do not worry about what is homosexual and what is not, just be yourself and do what feels right.
at certain ages and levels of maturity, hard testicles are always a problem.
you are attracted to gay men, that is certain.
in my opinion, cheating is wrong, no matter what your reason is.
no, men do not like that.
my own is large, well no it is not, however i do have a man.
however, i have dated women and they are capable of lunacy.
provide her with enough alcohol to be intoxicated then attempt to engage in passionate foreplay.
she will realize it, so assure her you will be there to support her no matter the circumstances.
additionally, you are an exceptional sexual partner if you both climax simultaneously.
if he has been in love three times, did he lose his love because of a death, or because of the end of a relationship?
i suggest you ask her, and when you decide to ask her use compassion in your voice and make eye contact.
if the picture gives you discomfort then why would you not tell him?
therefore, i wish my best for both of you!
it is possible that he may not want her to be in a relationship with you, and how is that?
if i dated someone simply based upon their appearance (which i do not), i would probably find myself ending the relationship.
that's rather stereotypical, wouldn't you say?
then he thinks i am pretending.
i must admit it: you could stand to lose him.
keep in mind that if you attempt to reach him at some point and he already has it, he could still always have two of it.
you have to think about who you like more, or do not date either of them and pick some one else.
you need to get rid of your past demons (why do you not like women?).
so i am guessing the sex will not either.
have you ever even heard of that sir-mix-a-lot song?
i decided i wanted him back.
he reminds me of my partner, my cheating former partner.
check the individual's underwear, if you see blood, there it is settled.
or, you could just ask him if he likes you as a real girlfriend.
consider if it is to the point where you have to think about someone else during sexual relations to be satisfied.
are there any volunteer moms who need a young person like myself?
consider the reception you desire.
they want what they cannot have.
surprise him and say hello.
he loves me, but i do not find him physically attractive.
all you other children need to grow up yourselves.
hopefully, you like the person immensely.
just be true to your heart.
i have been in a situation similar to that before, and yes you need to worry.
nobody said love was easy, and it is certainly not.
i believe she is smart, but she acts as if she is unintelligent.
if he played with you last year, he will play with you this year.
some girls do, but some girls do not.
that is the only way for me to go.
it is nice to be with a curvy girl; they are usually receptive to me.
it is the same as requesting a doctor be a good patient, am i correct?
the most important question is weather or not you can wait.
it doesn't always mean that your significant other should or desires to have that knowledge.
i don't know what to do, he is incredibly popular at school and i am concerned he won't like me.
even with love, it is the same as some huge contest.
sorry, i couldn't tell you the signs because i missed them.
i would do the same thing.
oh, do not do this, it is illegal.
well yes if he had a good explanation.
girl, i doubt that it is going to be a problem in the future.
i recommend that you have that examined.
it depends upon your capabilities.
do what you want and take advantage of other people.
your only options are to accept the situation or leave.
ask him about it and if he becomes agitated, it is highly likely that he is doing it.
hm, yes you might be deceived.
i say love, it is a flower, and you are its only seed.
honey, if you are asking this question, then you already know the answer.
inform your bestfriend that your bestfriend's boyfriend pursued you.
why do you want to share that information?
if you ask a gentleman on a date, you will feel elated.
by nature, men are nervous about sex while women are not.
it is important to remember that love is a social construct, you can fall in love at any age.
i have found myself in that situation and i hope to never repeat it.
i find myself attracted to a special woman.
please add me to your potential choices.
he would like it to be easy.
i would like to search on the internet and relax.
a person that has sexual relations with everyone but me is not my type of girl.
i still fantasize about when my wife was pregnant. she had an increased libido.
why have you not yet told them?
i weigh less than 110 pounds, but that is ignorant.
if you need to question it, then you are.
i prefer an equal amount of both.
you should thank them for the good times, but right now you need time to think about things.
were you thinking about getting your names, i love you, a heart, or a picture of you guys.?
to make you someone unhappy.
we were not together because i wasn't in that mode.
additionally, the fact that i am of tremendous size is not at all important.
you seem to be perpetually on a tight schedule. i am 30 years of age.
due to the fact that he was procuring something when he made that statement.
please consider the situation as if i were in your shoes and vice versa.
is it possible that the person in question is you and not the other gentleman?
divorce is very expensive, therefore you should only marry if you feel it is the appropriate action.
speak on the subject now if you have not previously done so.
sir, you will lose your vision.
find a pleasant gentleman to have a relationship with you.
in my opinion, invite whomever you wish to the wedding or reception.
do we fancy european women in particular?
in order to become skillful in giving fellatio, it is advisable to learn how to use what you posses.
it is advisable that he acts more mature.
at least not for quite some time.
you are an uneducated woman. i know who that woman is, and i advice you to tell her to go somewhere else.
she does not need friends like that.
you cannot do it as good as big momma.
you should only give him a kiss if he acts like he wants to kiss you.
if she looks sweet do not use tongue, and if she looks promiscuous use tongue.
you need to take care of yourself right now.
i do not have a problem with homosexual women, i know some of them like me.
i was just joking, it is totally ok to be homosexual.
you should just ask him for his email address.
i hope so, if nothing else know that god loves you.

no, darcy, that is not what i meant.
european girls are the hottest!

barney the dinosaur singing i love you and you love me.
it might be interesting if someone actually loves his wife when he married her.
it depends on your age and for how long.
tell him you have a good opinion of yourself also.
it all depends on what is going on in your relationship. tell us some more about your relationship.
if i am constantly asking this question?

you should be a polite and respectable woman and ignore his expressions that are unacceptable.
i don't have a clue.
keep proposing new idea, and if that fails, ask her how she is doing.
is he too much older than you?
could i restate my previous comment, here is a suggestion for something to defend yourself with.
attempt to be charming and be sure to make eye contact, if she responds positively, then continue to be charming.
day and then night, why do you have only one?
review the questions on your list dolon. you are being hyperbolic...
sexual relations can become monotonous if frequent, but adding variety to the experience will increase the excitement.
if you were unfaithful to him then i would not be able to blame him for being upset.
begin to reason if he likes you, and if you can reason this then ask him to enjoy some time together.
inform her that you are 21 years old and you are your own person.
do you believe i have possibly made her nervous?
i became aware when i felt a reaction in my chest and my head that is similar to a numbing sensation.
it doesn't appear that the situation is going to improve.
you can believe me on this point: that should make him happy!
you can exceed the norm for the way you and your friends have behaved.
i think sex is a beautiful thing and you should embrace it.
when i see a girl who dresses provocatively, what do expect a guy to think about?
love isn't ever how we expect it to be.
she's odd, if she doesn't enjoy it.
due to recent events. i i find myself single, at age fiftyone.
you're too young for myself.
what trust does she have with this other friend? why would that keep you from dating her?
first ask yourself, "why did he leave"?
it is time to divorce him and move on with the rest of your life.
yes, my boyfriends' do a lot.
there is no sense in crying over spilled milk, after the fact.
my crush has an odd taste in shoes, but i still like him a lot.
you should search for someone new to be your date.
it resulted in me sending a card stating mommy, a monkey followed me home.

gentlemen enjoy having their space.
he is currently on his very best behaviour.
chicken head was the loudest song we had.
i would call you a bad guy.

down there, if you catch my drift.
it helps relieve stomach pressure and is a wonderful position for hitting a woman's g-spot.
there really is no way to tell if someone is being honest with you.

i like to have sex post meals.
it means that he wants to be the individual he's concerned over.
she hadn't been searching for anyone at school, but there he was.
take her to speak with you.
there is a large difference in maturity between the ages of 16 and 21.
let the idea of being with her go and start looking around for a woman who'll work out better for you.
what woman could possibly refuse that offer?
because you are a complete fool who is trying to sound like he is tough and streetwise.
why would you want to know that?
god bless you, and hang in there.
or check to see if he wears a wedding ring.
if you really care for someone, it is the whole person you care about, not just what they look like.
he is in his mid forties.
please think on that for a while.
my fiance and i are freaking out.
not even if you and her be friends for thirty years.
good for you, and hopefully i find a nice guy someday, too.
a good expression of emotion, a good beverage, and a good friend.
do not do it as it is not worth the cost.
have you ever considered her motivation for moving out of it is a lack of desire to leave with you?
i believe you will understand my point of view when questioning if you would choose a mexican man instead of another man.
i view it in that sense.
i can see that it is all about his child, but to you it is him being around his ex girlfriend.
i used to have a boyfriend but we broke up.
i need someone to go out on dates with.
i get the strong feeling of wow and wonder where did that come from?
just because you cheated on him, that does not mean has to get mad at you, does he?
it is not beneficial; it alienates her.
express your need for space.
romantic men are not always the most suitable partners.
i would watch brokeback mountain, but not with my father.
you can just tell the secrets, however small, as long as they are cute.
how often do you do this... you know what i mean?
(please no physical fire... do not burn down your house)
i think you should beg for her forgiveness, but leave it be if she did not.
let him go with someone else, because you know that you can not get pregnant. i meant no disrespect.
is it possible to move beyond that and trust a woman again?
one must admit that guys can be forgetful, too.
i definitely do not want someone local.
however, this is just a woman's perspective.
her behavior is unacceptably out of control, she behaves in a very controlling manner, and she complains a lot.

when you generally do what the she/he prefers.
it would be ideal if you disclose to me, what is love?
being able to become friends with a non-heterosexual person would be great.
you can wear lingerie and he will stay around.
being in love should not change the person you are.
if he doesn't want to be with you, you should move on.
he is embarassing whenever he is around you.
i am too busy with my studies for commitment, but you are not alone.
once she starts counseling, do not be surprised if they do not confide much.
am i incorrect or is he lying about his feelings.
be honest and tell him that you do not feel the same as you once did.
do not wait until things get worse.
i would say chicken, or even rooster for that matter!
i just want her to be happy.
if you stay, you really are being no good to yourself, your children, or your wife.
she is your wife and you need to be with her.
time is not a factor unless the woman is really enjoying it.
it is not something you should be able to move in and out of at such a fast pace.
it is the equivalent of me playing as if i am homosexual when i am clearly attracted to me.
if your boyfriend is performing this, it shows he is clearly very attracted to you.
i find that personally, it is not something i am very interested in.
they are seeking someone who is both intelligent and entertaining.
color is not an issue when true love is involved.
no matter how much i fought that fact it was definitely the case for me.
yes, if that is your name.
when you think about someone all the time.
marriage is a mistake for some people.
he knows that you like him, and you are an easy target.
it is their personality,  and they flirt with me while they are sitting on my lap, while stealing kisses from me.
not all if you feel like it was the right thing to do.
they probably do not deserve you in the first place.
he is not attractive, in fact he is corny and lame.
he has been my best friend for three years, i could really use some advice.
a car is not that serious, i don't own one.
some people may still reside there.
there are some girls that do and those that do not.
that dance was not hard to learn. i performed it in grade school.
i am already dating at 12 years old.
i am leaving after i graduate high school.
go get help rather than overthinking it.
he has become distant, no longer compliments you and does not arrive when you have plans.
i do the same thing, so i think it is.
in my opinion, you should just ask her on a date.
i am afraid that she is on drugs.
i would not tempt karama.
i have been married for three years and am seeking advice to improve our intimate relationship.
begin to look for something else that you want, lady.
you will survive, be sure to be aware of your decisions that you are making!
tell him what your wants and needs are and then continue the conversation from that point.
in addition, if you want to converse further then please use email as a means of communication.
if you present a man with everything he states he wants, and he is still unhappy, then perhaps it is time to progress with your life.
if you are low on cash you could give a card with flowers, a hug and a passionate kiss.
boyfriends come and go but best friends are forever.

the truth is if your parents did not love you they would have put you out.
i have always liked that one.
so why is life so tough?
boyfriends come and go but your true friends will be there no matter what.
you need your friends when things get hard.
i'm an old fashioned kind of guy.
i am against domestic women.
your girlfriend is being picky.
you didn't reply with "i love you", so he likely won't reply back.
answer this question instead: would you respect a woman who was not challenging to attract?
never hate; when you hate, you become discouraged.
simply be authentic, and if he is the correct man for you, he will be your man.
yes; this is because he seems like the type of person who is insincere.
however, i do not know whether he has lost romantic feelings towards me.
it is true that you should be careful what you wish for.
i am enjoying sex, but am also open to try new things. what do you suggest?
perhaps she is still getting over you and would like to keep one memento of you.
that is the reason i am dating eric.
i am sorry that you are having to deal with that.
that indicates that you are feeling the need to have sex.
the reason is that you probably don't feel anything.
you should find a new guy and make your ex-boyfriend jealous.
the best approach is to be honest and tell her if you don't love her.
i have never kissed a boy before.
yes, i was not smart for that one.
sometimes alone time is the best method to know yourself and what you want and need.
you are getting leftovers, and the other women's problems that he did not aware you of.
life carries on so you have to move on.

i met my husband in an online chat.
he is attractive, funny, and smart. he is my type of man. one problem though, he tends to flirt a lot. what should i do?
my first kiss was last year.  i was 15 years old.

some people are just scared of "the d word": divorce.
talking to people on the internet is like talking to mystery people.
good luck!  i hope i helped a bit.
my ex spouse and i were together for four years.
it's as if the guy decides to connect.
i have often had that feeling in my life.
if you guys can magage, then no.
i'm not sure, that girl sounds crazy.
i don't want a simple answer, i need it explained to me.
go with the flow, don't call back, and find someone new.
my husband send our prayers to your marriage and your children.
hug him at his waist, and kiss his lips or cheeks.
by the way, beautiful is the wrong answer.
like most men, you are blind, women expect men to read our minds.
only do it when you are in a good mood.
no matter what, a good lover will want to please you first.
you'll be fine if you follow along with what he is doing.
think about it, maybe he is gay.

other than the fact that they could be called "queen mother".
you have given him chances before, it is time to get on with your life.
do it once in awhile.
i do not ever do anything about it.
it would depend on the mistake; pray over what you have done.
unless you're both divorced, i don't see you two getting together.
if you want to acquire a girlfriend, why ask the internet?
i like fun, attractive women who don't smoke.
i think blue but not just me, lots of others think blue as well.

yes, sometimes i think about the color blue because i am sad.  do not worry, it is normal to think that way.
keep me informed of things and let me know the result.  best of luck and have fun!
no, my boyfriend is younger than i am.
go to the extreme if you choose.
maybe you will be lucky and she will want to date you!
most people, sadly, do not realize the the difference between the act of sex, and love-making
if i had a boyfriend who was cheating on me, it is common sense.
move on, and you should not have moved in with him. keep telling ladies this, as they don't believe me.

ask her what the situation is between the two of you. if she says 'just friends,' then leave things as they are.

your best friend or her boyfriend?
find adventure with other people, because neither of you are happy with the adventure happening between the two of you.

maybe it was just small talk. i wouldn't look too far into it.
remember to be nice to the girls.
think about the mucus, fungus, and my mother-in-law.
some guys are not good looking, but there are others that are.
no, it just means he is arrogant and wants to play games, so be careful that you do not get hurt.
you are probably holding your lighter too close to it.
also, guys like girls who like games.
you know, you should not worry about it that much.
do not let your wife off the hook!
write him a note that asks the question "do you like me? circle yes or no".
if they guy that you are with cares a lot about you and loves you, then stick with him.
i guess it depends, do they both know you love them and another person?
perhaps you all have a few suggestions?
you are supposed to ask them to marry you.
i you do, i am very interested in speaking with you because he is the most handsome person alive.
he visited my in arizona on christmas and gave me a diamond ring.
he may just tell you.
if he was interested in your friend, then he would be in a relationship with her.
people do not always marry the right person.
why is is that younger men like older women?
the person keeps it in the house.
i conferred with my friend after the incident occured.
the gentleman seems as though a nice man and deserves a chance.
it is difficult to grasp when loved by someone that has forced you out.
it is how rings could be worn.
i find the purple desirable, because it is more inspiring and cheerful.
victoria's secret is a great option, and if cost is no obstacle, take her on a weekend get away.
i think i know what you are referring to.
yes, you should be open and honest.
it is not difficult, it just does not go they way we would like. there is a difference.
i do not date anyone younger than seventeen.
whatever you do, make sure he does not cheat.
what can i do?
no, because when i flirt, you must know that it was he that was flirting first.
if a man isn't ready to propose his love, than that is perfectly okay.
she then told me that she was not interested in that man to begin with.
there is a lot of confusion, we have never seen each other physically, only via photo and web camera.
if you really love him you can explain to him that being disrespectful to your friends isn't okay.
he often checks on the boys in their pajamas.
while being chinsy and dishonest, he doesn't seem like a mature man.
we have large arms and attractive bodies, or so we wish!
one should not date until the divorce has been finalized.
thank you for the reply regarding the older man.
i am mad, because this girl is telling me that she is not worried about me trying to have sex with her.
tight boxers are more sexy.
the answer has to be the fact that you love them more.
that is a very popular idea.
my neck, lower back and thighs. *laughing*
i would suggest that you just move on.
i would not want to have to wait.
when it comes to emotions, men just do not show it.
and to have what you want with a real person.
perhaps it was him, and he had no other way to tell you that.
it takes trust on both sides.
"hands up" posters of that era in your reception area.
it is not all the girls responsibility though.
perhaps it is best to give it some more time and see if he shows up.
well, i tried giving advice...
and maybe, they will become good friends.
cheat on him. have sex with his best friend.
write her a letter if you feel uncomfortable.
oh my god, he is so adorable!
i suggest you look at her straight in the eyes with a kind look on your face.
i am so glad that you posed this question.
which celebrity would you like to have sex with?
therefore, we enjoy having sex very much.
good luck, and i hope it works out for you.
you should tell the truth when talking with me.
it took me a year to admit to my friend, cherry, and myself that i was falling in love with him.
in my opinion, you ended up dating the wrong guy.
when i thought a guy was attractive, i sent him a card on valentines day.
you are very lucky.  don't worry about it.
it depends on the girl's nature.
regardless of what you get, it's what you give that actually counts.
girls are only interested in money.
it would be like asking if they need help.
yes, when your having sex you are connected as one.
treat them like they are the most spectacular women you have ever met
do not listen to everything dragonfire tells you.
before we part, i will say this:
or, how extensively involved would you allow a male to become with you?
it shall be difficult, but you must conquer it.
now, i am baffled and have no clue how to proceed
the answer to your inquiry does not lie in me nor anyone else you may ask.
is he merely pretending, does he genuinely care, should i simply forget?
do you look at her differently, has it affected her original impression?
it is terrifying because he is almost nine.
why don't they ask you out?
i am not acquainted with you?
it does not make any sense as to why you would buy an engagement ring for a past girlfriend.
this is when you become a legal adult.
an experienced marriage counselor would be helpful.
if you are being very sexually active at the age of 13 then it is highly probable you will be raising a child at the age of 16.
i do not understand why a person cannot just be mine.
we act differently on the internet.
he is everything i require of a man.
not everything that happens in life is great.
i hope you realize the caliber of man you have and not cheat on him.
if you love them then the response is certainly.
when it starts to happen, take a breath and distract yourself by thinking of something else, such as drag racing.
do they feel they need to hide what they need and want?
they looked me up and down then smiled.
you should speak with him about whether or not he is ready for that kind of commitment.
i am 18 and watched dvds alone with him.
you should stick your tongue in there.
if they are your friends, they would not be attempting to steal your significant other.
by nature, they are the ones that men are attracted to.
we have been together for three years.
we did not get to know each other before.
yes, if you are a man.
do not hesitate and stumble over your words.
i would call a person like that a phony friend.
if that is the case, then yes!
but whose business is it really, anyway?
i really enjoy wearing my husband's t-shirts and sweatpants.
go visit your doctor, and tell them that.
you would need to categorize this question to get a direct answer.
yes, i hope you know him. it is only dating.
try having sex without: one, thinking about it; two, listening to it; or three, thinking about it.
people change, his not the same person from ten years ago.
what should i do?
if you have not engaged in sexual activity, then you are still a virgin.
are they just seeing people?
he is mostly likely a player that is not worth your time.
keep it clean; i would like to know how to conduct myself to avoid removal. thank you.
my screen name is jvlmrive for aol, so come talk to me.
to throw away your friendship would be foolish.
our three-month anniversary is soon, and i don't know what to give her. (she likes frogs.)
(sarcasm) that is your valentine's day present!
sometimes i just sit there and watch my friends go crazy.
just ask him if there's a chance that he likes you.
you both feel the same thing at the same time.
you shouldn't act too silly, just be yourself.
obviously you are not getting what you need.
you apologize by buying her some flowers and telling her that you love her.
we message on the internet but she does not always reply to my messages.s
if you didn't have intercourse, then you are
most men do not notice me.
at the young age of fifteen, you should be more concerned about your education and goals as opposed to boys.
it is probably already happening, you are just unaware of it.
this is emotional, i would say you either have to choose them or yourself.
that depends on what the actual truth is.
that may be true, but it does take time, that is my point.
it means he loves himself more than he loves you.
set up the bar similar to the speakeasy fashion.
ask yourself this question: am i happy?
he broke up with me because he does not like long relationships.
your answers make it seem that she is a blow up doll, and t have sex with it.
we were happy that we forgot everything.
you have to ask him, and let him know your feelings.
if everything else fails, just have a conversation.
maybe it is your present behavior towards the world.
women love real, not fake, items.
if you are not assisting him, then you are creating a bigger problem for both of you.
it very much depends on the girl.
two of them already have a family.
do not forget to be a gentleman.
if your classmates are constantly flirting with you, and giving you hugs or love notes, it is important that this attention is wanted.
talk to her about things she is interested in.
if you have had sexual contact, then you are not practicing abstinence, and should use protection.
i guess you should improve your self-esteem. how would you go about doing this?
he is a friend of mine, he was my classmate.
give you boyfriend time, because you say it doesn't mean he is obliged to.
they have an incredible marriage, and love each other dearly.
my son asks why can't his father be like my husband bob?
my family seems to go senile at eight, but you understand what i mean?
i believe she wasn't my bestfriend.
that situation will be hard, have you spoken to your best friend about it?
if all else fails, smash his computer.
no, i do not think in those colors.
when i speak, i say "hey there sweet thing".
do not forget: boy's do not write letters, they propose.
when men wear boxes they look childlike.
sometimes i think mean look for a woman to treat them poorly.
if they are between 40 and 43, then it is okay.
i have the same problem.
understand a woman needs to know that you hear her.
men wearing boxers appear similar to young boys
on occasion, i believe a small number of men intentionally seek a woman who will treat them poorly.
however, it is acceptable if their ages are forty and forty-three.
i agree, i experience the same problem.
you must always be aware of a woman's need to believe you are listening to her.
you should purchase her something meaningful, something that she doesn't already own.
it would be ill-advised to have a sexual relationship with that type of person.
yes, i am myself when i am around her. however, i would like for her to perceive me differently. do you have any suggestions?
when you least expect it to, it will occur.
with me, it is either all, or nothing.
please be sure to purchase a man a drink sometime.
i believe most males notice the internal beauty of a female first.
if he is the one you prefer, stay with him.
i should mention that my wife will never leave the nursing home.
a man is either wonderful or he is a cad.
they were not worth your time if they leave the relationship because you express your feelings.
and if he did it one time he knows he has enough power over me to do it again.
get back out there and look for someone special.
do not dip your pen in the company ink!
i shall select "dam & duf blind woman."
my youngest brother is nine years younger than i.
why not travel to your local school where you may possibly have the band perform a few arrangements?
i have a unique unicorn my husband simply adores.
he proposed to me, and i accepted.
because all you will do is eventually spout loathesome babble.
what can i say other than i am merely blessed?
but, we became friends regardless, and that was the end.
and, i adore nature such as butterflies, flower, trees, and anything similar.
time escapes tracking when you are on yahoo answers.
it sounds as if counseling may be a lot of help to you two.
then ask a girl if she will have sex with you.
in a bedroom on a bed.
ghosts; monsters in the closet or under the bed.
no, perhaps he just wanted to have a conversation or his friends are not spending time with him that day.
your stylist will know how to do it. it is finger waves and combed out.
either do not worry about it, ot give it preamble.
i had my first kiss at age 11.
i still hate scary movies to this day.
even straight girls can fall for a tomboy.
okay, leave it to myself to throw a wrench in the question.
and once he is aware how do i get him to be with me?
this is the best i can come up with.
food, and the best romantic soundtrack.
let's begin from there, so do that home girl.
maybe you should ask yourself, "why am i curious about this?"
sorry, i let my emotions get the best of me there.
if she is already in a relationship, do not pursue her.
allow me to make a mistake this once.
if you are not fulfilled sexually, leave the relationship
they also enjoy receiving flowers and letters from apologetic men.
what should i do if he has the attention of other beautiful women?
it is possible that her significant other cannot or will not go.
if we show any sort of sex-drive, we are labeled negatively.
how does the other male feel about you?
however, things could turn negative when you actually meet each other because they see who you really are.
simply call him on the phone.
many people do not confess how they feel when they should.
and of course, he will do the same to you.
get married when you are ready. do not let them pressure you!
men like to watch their women pleasure themselves.
her girlfriend is pretty great too.
find someone else, don't waste your time.
i would be apologetic towards her, and then kiss her.
online advice is always wives submit to husbands and vice versa.
and, since the intercourse is not enjoyable, you will not be tempted to repeat the action with her.
i simply recently informed him that i had a partiality towards him.
not if her male paramour is around or an envious individual.
ah, yes, do not forget to swallow.
to each, their own, but for what reason?
engage yourself with activities, there by distracting your attention from him.
request the status of his affiliation to you.
to sacrifice your favorite pastimes for a man warrants pity.
she proceeded to converse with that gentleman.
if you assist them, age is irrelevant.
yes, if you are into bsdm.
ok, girls like it when you make them seem special. so, tell her.
hey, what is up? everything explains me, except college.
just do it live, as the nike slogan says.
or, maybe. and, we hope not!
i do not care what anyone else says. love is never lost.
i guess this is goodbye.
breasts, buttocks, vaginas, and mouths.
do you think someone did something to you while you were unaware?
that is if you already know what you would like.
i did not want to ask her for her e-mail for one reason, because i wanted to forget everything that had happened.
if he will cheat with you, he will cheat on you.
i am, as it was i behave better with her around
if all else fails move on, there are other fish in the sea.
i told him not to take himself so seriously and think about how others feel.
you have given her everything that she needs but did you ever think to ask her what she wants?
we only saw each other through photos and cameras, never face to face.
guess what will happen if you think that way?
so, they get mad because they don't feel like they can as easily.
also, men mature later then women.
it depends on what you mean by a phone relationship.
i'm really tired of these women who think that if you're not thin or tight, you're a joke.
first of all, you aren't a screw up.
i am not promiscuous, but luckily i am not a virgin either.
rest assured, it is not always the woman.
in other words, my entire life.
if it kept happening, i'd eventually confide in my friend.
if he did, he would not have been unfaithful in the first place.
most men have a tendency of using someone.
men have a tendency of visually seeking out a female rather than what is in their hearts.
there is much more to come.
when you are in love with your spouse you are accepting of their faults.
what is it that a male is contemplating as he gazes into your eyes nightly?
talkin to your woman is the best advice that i can give you.
look around, there are beautiful women all around you. you have to decide if you're looking for inner beauty or outter beauty.
do you want to find your lost friend?
there is nothing to be afraid of, get out there and do what needs to be done.
it will feel like lightening hit you.
once you mature, you may come back to each other.
how appealing you are, and how fast he recognizes you.
how does she shake her hips, and turns her head?
ask her what she enjoys doing on the weekends.
it will not happen, because men dislike desperation.
does it not amaze you what money can accomplish?
even though he says he is not afraid?
go ahead, unless it is on the cheeks.
some do, but not all the way.
it is not going to happen, because guys hate desperation.
is it amazing what money can do?
even if he says differently, he is afraid.
unless it is on the cheeks, then go ahead.
some do, but not all.
if he can't cooperate, then file for a divorce.
yes, because we usually have intercourse.
yes, i would even go to bed with him.
i do think it is a big deal, but it is for some girls.
for either yes or no, tell me why.
he told me i am crazy, sweet, and beautiful.
you should wear cologne, most girls like guys who smell good.
we do not want our friends to see us with an ugly girl.
do not jump in head first until you are able to get your life back together.
that is called bestiality. blue would be better suited for another dog.
there is just enough fat to cover up the abdomen muscles.
i think boxers look outdated.
i will not label any necessary thing as "should be".
if you and him are truely friends, then you must know his address. you should go there and get the details.
now, he is acting completely uninterested in me, saying things like, "i used to love you."
if you are certain, let her go.
do you think she is attracted to you?
it is such a common trait that i wouldn't call it weird.
those are the signs of a man interested in a relationship.
why not try asking her out? perhaps to a movie or something?
yet, when a man calls you on the phone, you do not answer or return the call. what kind of behavior is this?
i am not sure if i can still marry her.
she should also return your things, unless you told her they were gifts.
and are low enough to convince him to leave his wife.
and, intelligence is what i prefer in a woman.
alas, simply present yourself and allow him to know.
alas, the violent femmes instructed to do so.
you require counseling with your husband if circumstances are repugnant.
i came to the realization, i want him in my life.
women like when men ask them out in person.
men are like dogs, you scold them once, they won't do it again.
i don't accept the other way, it is perverted.
how can i get his answer to be yes?
what would you like to do?
they loved their mother dearly.
i believe that my husband and my sex life is much better than before we got married.
it does not matter how old you are, only when the time is right.
men and women alike come in all shapes and sizes.
whoever accepts you, they are lying.
i wouldn't call them a friend.
a lot of girls all over the world.
for the virgin girls out there, great job.
no, that is not repugnant, but that is not something that you desire to speak to others.
indeed, you merely need to have caution.
it has been three years, and i love him fiercely.
is she truly your most significant companion?
all you have to do is "inform" your wife that you are a worthy husband.
yes, look at my case, i apologize.
i have to say blue looks better on other items.
i don't know, you're about 21 when you finish school.
it is normal, and men like it.
you broke up for some reason.
well friend, it sounds like she is very important!
the boy i told you i liked came to my house today.
she needs to know you both need other friends.
not all are jerks, they just need to step out from behind their egos and grow up.
yes, it is nothing to avoid.
unless you are twenty and the other person is fifteen, then that is not good in my opinion.
at the end, just point to the bed and you know what to do then.
i prefer the black and chrome.
if you are doing it too fast, you should slow down.
most of them are very unattractive.
there are not many good ones these days.
to meet ladies, get dates, and to hang out.
being in love makes you defy reasoning.
my next wedding will be outside in the spring with a lot of flowers on a beautiful lawn.
if you desire to ruin your relationship, then go ahead.
there is a girl i know who the sex is terrible with.
do not date the sadist; tell him to leave you alone.
more of the silent type, or the more active one?
im glad that you have found someone that makes you truely happy.
living with your mother or father is fine as long as you are helping out.
think i should let my boyfriend know that im going to the concert.
if you know what she likes get her that.
your young slow down and enjoy yourself.
get rid of everything that reminds you of this guy.
even if you do not date until you are out of school, who cares?
pray when it seems like jesus is not listening, pray some more. i have been there.
i would probably get tired of it.
if you do not feel right, then do not do it.
if he was interested, do you think he would act tired?
yes. i would like to do a foursome with you involved.
do not let it get to your head.
why would you want a man that would leave his wife for you, or anyone else?
maybe he has been hurt before, and is afraid that you will hurt him too.
please do not lose that, it is a nice thing to have.
my advice is, tell him the truth, and hope he receives it well.
although i am sort of shy at first, i am completely comfortable, once i get to know someone.
it is because they dislike being corrected.
there are plenty more guys that you can focus on.
when you fell from heaven, what did you say?
it depends on how long you have been dating.
if you really love them, give them a leader with discipline and strenght.
as you've mentioned, you will get your desire, if you're like that.
it's over, so break it off totally.
don't be obliged, if you want to go for long, i am pondering if he does as well.
it will much more fun than before.
women are not blind, we see much.
you seem to lack some self-assurance.
the female that he fancies, is my best friend?
if he pulls out and claims he was not aware that the condom broke, then he's probably lying.
just wait until you are older and then perhaps she will like you!
there is nothing wrong in trying, since many, including you, are there for fun.
i am married and see my wife only twice a week, when it is necessary.
yes, i do love blue, but also hot pink and lime green!
however, if she does not like you?
that girl does not deserve you, you should break-up with her.
if she does not, you may want to tell her.
i would say that you should, because they are fund and you get a chance to travel around the world.
it does hurt when the person you like wants someone else, and shows it.
they are married now and/or have kids.
i believe he is cheating on me, but there's no proof, just an intuitive feeling.
you know you should end the relationship.
don't use a coat hanger!
do not be too shy to answer the question.
additionally, though something may be legal does not mean it is right.
he does know she is not intelligent, correct?
girls are like candy.  the cover can be compared to virginity, so you should be a virgin!
please get this jerk caught because he is very bad!
you know he is interested if he flirts a lot with you, and if he pays a lot of attention to you.
when you feel the kiss, you can kiss.
guys have short hair and girls have long hair.
excuse me, miss, i can't help to think that i know you from somewhere.
imbecile, respond to me if you understand me.
i am a girl, i am in this situation.
look them in the eye, be honest, humorous, and slightly flirtatious.
essentially inform him you are favoring him, and feelings are uncontrollable, thus, what is to come afterwards?
because, in a sense, it is fine if a male is promiscuous, but not for a female.
are you looking forward to getting a message from her via email or text?
you should be brave and ask him out.
you should try as hard as you can because one day she will talk again.
i am not sure, but i think you should take things slower in your relationship.
blindfold her and take her to the top of the building.
it is your decision. do not let other people choose your boyfriend.
the bridesmaids will buy their dresses.
my significant other had an affair but since i had done the same previously, i told him that we were even.
i cannot tell you but it lasts forever when it is love.
if you had one wife and she gave you a daughter, you would have had to try for a second child.
lust had nothing to do with it.
however, if you are comfortable there and your parents do not mind, then sure, why not?
actually, it is when you start asking this question.
i recommend to stop fighting and flow with it!
share your feelings and see how she feels.
get on one knee and apologize.
my boyfriend is in iraq and i wanted some gift ideas for valentine's day.
all that you need in a relationship is for you to still like each other.
just get what you want!
it isn't tough love or even love.
you need to forget about him.
people don't understand love.
a woman is not needed for life; however, she is needed to keep me company.
i feel like i mess up a lot.
if things are not working out, leave your husband, but don't run off with the new guy yet.
if he is willing to flirt, flirt back. maybe you will end up together.
in my opinion, love and friendship are the same.
it is obvious that they like you for who you are, which is great.
it is time to get out and be independent.
talk to him, and if you become good friends, tell him that you like him.
just wait for her to return.
where can i find some pornography?
are you having casual sex or is it a friends with benefit type?
it is because we think differently on a lot of things.
i hope you are not a girl trin.
i dont believe men are one or the other.
do not change for this guy.
yes, i am kind of going through the same thing.
friends do not give friends lists of demands!
i am not jealous.
hello, i am junior and i would like to be your pen pal.
do you want some of this black booty?
no one can be considered hot until after they are 17 years old.  before that everyone is just cute.
i like brunettes that have long, soft hair.
i cannot put it into words.
no thank you. that was a silly question that people ask.
no it is not right and that is sad.
some brunettes have long hair.
it is difficult to say.
some people ask questions that do not make sense.
it is sinful and that's awful.
if you do not change some things about yourself, all guys will just use and abuse you.
if you really like the guy, then make the effort to spend time with him.
well, i am experiencing the same thing.
if you are not currently in school, you need to move out of the house.
you do not want to get back together with your man.
they want to be mean because they believe that their husbands are mean.
just relaz a little. good things only come once in a lifetime, maybe twice, if we are lucky.
if they pursue a relationship together, you are going to have to move on.
i left my home the day after graduation to pursue a job opportunity.
i am twenty years old and have plenty of electronics.
you do not have to date anyone that you do not want to.
on a small island in hawaii on the beach during the daytime.
also makes the kissing more exciting.
you need to ask him why his father let him date the other girl and not you.
blue says, "i am thinking you are crazy with this".
unless, of course, it is porn involving children. that is very wrong.
is it wrong to fantasize about sucking cock?
i'm assuming that he really cares about me.
after you talk to her, give her time to figure out exactly what she wants.
if you are sometimes nice, i wouldn't consider you a major prep.
he is not doing all of the things that he used to do.
yes, my husbands clothes are very comfortable!
he might, but worse he probably doesn't.
i think it is great!
being caught with an ex can mean the end of your relationship.
opposites attract, so it doesn't matter if you two don't have anything in common.
i would take him back, but it would take a while for me to let him come home.
if you want to get ready for love, read this book.
my friend set me up with her friend, a nurse.
when you tell him you are not ready he will respect your wishes, if he loves you.
be more considerate and do not brush her off just because you have already told her that you want to break-up.
if you quit now, it is only going to be harder.
i would say to think and try to remember if you possibly did something.
as far as telling him that you liked him?
because women never stop talking and are always complaining about something.
i feel heartbroken, because i am also in a long distance relationship with someone i love.
it is because good men present no challenge to women.
however, watch out for older guys, because the majority of them only want to sleep with you.
is it that you are just not ready yet?
i am confident that my backside and legs are nice, and that i am not overweight, by any means.
bring her some exotic flowers. look in her eyes, and tell her how you feel.
if nothing changes, tell your best friend.
when you love someone, you don't falsify your actions just because you are with your girlfriends.
he likes it at home. he isn't ready, i'm hurt, (and i am ready)!
oh my goodness! it is crazy that you asked that question.
do not let him get under your skin.
other than that, is everything is good?
i am a boy in the eighth grade, and i am fond of my friend.
be happy you are fortunate enough to have a significant other all together.
do not listen to others that tell you to give him a chance.
i am 17 years of age currently dating a 21 year old. the age difference is not a problem for us.
although i do not like it, it happens to me frequently.
everything will work out great.
we live the best we can.
so, if a girl was to cheat or express herself sexually, she would be breaking that mentality.
average, big, huge, or "what is that thing"?
definitely briefs, i think they are very sexy.
also, do not date a guy to get over a different guy.
yes, if you are a guy.
perhaps a man is interested in you, more than just physically?
yes i am hurt but i only flirt when, you can guess who, flirts first.
best of luck to you, captain blarg, you internet aberration.
truly, unless you realize for sure he is self-centered bigot, just ask.
i want to end our relationship because he is disrespectful to my friends.
personality, intelligence and also what most women refer to as the stomach.
yes, it is less expensive.
ask him if he has someone and if he says no, then you should ask him out.
it isn't wise to say that you are more attractive than your girlfriend.
the man has to come to the woman first.
just look at it this way.
good luck, keep your head up.
just approach her, converse with her, and see if you all enjoy each other.
i am really smart and i am not hot, but i am not ugly either.
go to dating sessions if you are that kind of guy(or girl, just consider that)
i do not want to just flirt with her.  i am interested in a sincere relationship.
they were hurt a little but are fine.
wow, this man is very mean!
are they more important to you than you are to them?
it depends on what types of guys attract you.
your kind of love is unselfish, i respect it.
i have had bad experiences with them and advise that you stay away from them.
he was my first love and i have always kept him in my heart.
you should check and make sure that he is ok.
the man is not even creative.
the man requests an embrace from me.
you do not want a girlfrined more so than just having sexual intercourse.
you should be direct in what you request.
there are different standards between males and females in terms of sexual relationships.
how can i get this female to be attracted to me?
this is a good thing to know by the way.
so, how do i know if he has feelings for me or not?
or, if you meant the none-perverted way, you would use salad tongs.
if it was a mistake that you had made, then you will need to apologize for it.
not rock hard ab muscles, but it is not flab either.
i wish you the best. remember to just be confident, honest and caring.
blue is my favorite color. sometimes it is associated with the feeling of sadness.
if you are a legal adult you should not have to rely on your parents so much.
age is just a number.
it depends, do you really want to meet him?
i think that this is the incorrect answer!
when you are in love with someone you do not have eyes for anyone else.
should i wait? or move out?
no he might be strong in all the right areas, but he won't be around as much.
as long as you are happy, it doesn't matter what others say.
do they like constantly flirting girls, or just occasionally flirty ones?
you need to meet rosy palm and her five friends.
friends are supposed to support you and not their partner.
my sense of maternal pride is strong- even for strangers.
simply accept the love that is available.
purchase for her a stuffed frog with a heart on it or some other item that combines the ideas love and frogs.
you are excited and eager to enjoy yourself.
when you cease asking that question.
because he would like to be friends with you and nothing more.
try some clothes that flatter your thighs and buttocks.
it all depends on how the relationship is going.
tell her exactly how you are feeling, just tell her nicely.
number two; join him and beat him in the game.
change nothing and love him as a friend.
i like people with good personalities.
many males look for a female to support them.
for your information my mother moved out on her own when she graduated high school.
men don't fight with females because women are usually more weak.
men come and go, do not let this one ruin your friendship.
you are too young to be infatuated with a boy.
no matter how mean he is to you, do not hate!
keep it to yourself, they do not need to know.
i don't believe so, it is near.
i understand, it's odd, but i enjoy it.
you can't decide who you love, your heart chooses.
just ask how she feels about it.
i can't call to say something like that.
by the way, i am 17 years old, and he is as well.
of course he will, if you let him try.
everything about them is great; their looks, the way they carry themselves, their independence, and intelligence.
do guys like that trait in girls?
i guess it is something that makes all girls irritated.
no, it's not love in any shape or form.
you deserve a lot more than that man.
he bounces, he shoots, he scores two points.
if it burns when you urinate it's because, i believe, you have a disease or something.
i believe he does because i hang around with tons of girls, but not necessarily the ones i enjoy.
never open mail from a stranger.
don't be yourself, you're embarrassing.
ask him as if it were someone else.
good idea, now he knows you care, so he will be thinking of you.
are you going to spend the rest of your life with this person?
do not cut is short, hold the conversation for a while.
i wish you the best.
she and i are still friends, and i still care about her greatly.
he asked me my address and pretended to like me.
when it comes to family, the females have that.
when she inquired, did it hurt?
i realize that this isn't too in depth, but i do hope that it helps!
be yourself and use your style to your advantage.
also the first time is all about the attraction.
i apologize, i do not fit into her clothing.
what i am saying is that it is hard to know if it is true love until you spend time with the person.
if you act like english royalty or liz hurley, you will do great!
i suggest you get even by cheating on him and i will help you.
if he really loves you, he will want to spend the rest of his life with you as well.
i do not know because i have not seen it.
i wish the both of you the best in life.
everything that you do with him may be romantic for him, and you as well.
you were far off topic.
at least this way you have a 50% change of happiness, and i wish you luck.
that depends on how long and how well you've known them.
her ex-boyfriend and her current boyfriend are buddies.
do not confide in her.
if you fall in love get married.
his wife lives in an assisted living facility.
my ex-boyfriend is friends with a guy i like.
2nd, do not tell her anything anymore.
when you find someone you love and you are ready to marry.
answer it and it is not sace our ship.
my wife is in a nursing home.
a lot of people wonder how you became so accomplished at such a young age?
seeing a person twice a week is excessive.
watch out and be extremely careful to avoid injury
did i say i would think about it?
a reality love show is not what i expected from him.
you are capable of accomplishing it.
due to the fact that he already has a lover, his game system.
i believe it is due to the fact that males are often more co-dependent than women.
maybe for some, but not all.
i wish you the best of luck, i believe it will be fun and exciting once you walk through the door.
remember, at all times perform the correct actions so that it will not haunt you afterwards.
do not concern yourself, you will mature into it.
i assume no, as everybody desires change.
i hope that the romantic encounter went as you had desired.
i believe males prefer long hair, and most of my male companions prefer a brunette.
okay, this is the biggest shock to a young man.
only one man is worthy of the pleasure of taking your virginity, and that man is not your boyfriend.
alternatively you could go to las vegas or reno and win her a stuffed frog.
no, why? did he break up with you?
you shoudl apologize for valentine's day and give her a bunch of sweet gifts like roses and cocoa.
be honest with her, and move on.
trust me you will find someone better.
love isn't easy either.
you sound very popular with men!
they don't want to date their mother.
personally, i think it is wrong to cheat on my spouse.
i need information on having good sex.
have you explained to your partner that you like someone knew?
do your best so you can enjoy the best.
don't do anything because he wants you to, do it because you want to.
unbelievably, it is all about the money.
the male is able to know, the female more than likely cant.
there are more productive questions to ask.
men do not make plans to cheat on women.
i am unaware of anyone who does.
i recently met the most charming and sweet guy i've ever known.
maybe she is attracted to us.
have you ever met the man you speak to on the phone?
explain exactly how you feel, don't hide anything.
that stereotypical saying is true, it does take two to tango.
love knows no boundaries, we are all just people!
finding this out the hard way is kind of sad.
try your best, and if she cannot to appreciate it, it is her fault not yours!
looking at it you will go limp or it will dry up, try it!
you may not be as adventurous.
there are men who like me, those who don't and those who are intimidated by me.
it didn't feel right.
i like men who are truthful.
fifteen years old is young to be dating.
you should tell your best friend.
do it clothed, while lying in bed or on a couch.
what can one do when it strongly feels destined to be?
could you explain how i should kiss him?
do not kiss each other if you think it will become more physical.
i hope you receive some better solutions.
don't let it bother you.
after all we've been through, i don't feel i love my husband anymore.
she is well-liked by many boys.
encourage the guests to dress in that era for the best experience.
i never seen her sleep, she is my girlfriend.
he is coming to meet you.
last but not least, you need to spend money on her, do not be cheap.
is she into that type of stuff?
i am bisexual and i would never do that, but if you feel that you have to go for it!
it is possible that it is just getting boring.
which types of flirting do men prefer?
he is a republican. are you a democrat?
so, ma'am, take your time.
the act of "swinging" is considered by many to be an unsavory practice.
you will only be able to be with him alone, otherwise.
finally, why is it that women make better nurses than men?
i think i look like a fairy tale princess.
how do i begin a conversation with someone?
he is probably not a bot.
i can call you father!
it is hard to tell, except for maybe the bonding comment.
when you focus on yourself first, someone will come later.
maybe at the end of the night.
i do not think enzyte will increase the size of your manhood.
then he must be able to trust you in getting married.
what does one do when the man you love cannot stop staring at another woman while you are with him?
i am on a fast, need-to-know basis.
you are her knight in shining armor, in a manner of speaking.
friend, if it were my decision, he would disappear for doing something foolish.
his possession of a vehicle is a good sign, haha.
then you caress her cheek and tell her that she's very attractive. then you need to be close friends.
i perceive you as a challenge. and that is a good perception, if a woman desires a challenge.
you should not end your relationship with him for another man.
then secure with bobby pins in a criss-cross pattern.
last night, his parents revealed that they have given him permission to move out with me!
do you know if the person is cheating and where?
i like technicolor because i feel that it shows the real me.
go out with your friends and enjoy a girls' day!
you do not want to be mean, or have her misinterpret your feelings.
he can easily hold conversations with other females, he can joke with them, etc.
get rid of the moron before he becomes dangerous to you!
especially if the other man does not even notice you.
when you turn 18 years of age, then you may leave.
you only live once and sexually transmitted disease is not as serious as it once was.
in reality, money is not always the key issue.
you are not missing out on anything; i just got back in the game myself.
i suggest you talk to her about her preferences.
if a guy is someone you date on the rebound, tell them so and enjoy it.
or you can figure it out the difficult way.
do you believe that's anybody's problem with us as really what he or she is?
try asking "do you want to go out" it works.
look upset and make her aware that your life isn't going on without her.
i haven't been around either of ou guys to tell if there is a connection between the two of you.
try walking around the neighborhood; you will not just loose weight, but you will also be more active.
i sit around and call all my friends when they are gone.
i always hear people say that they like europeans more.
on top of that, my name is bob.
in love, age really does not matter at all.
if that doesn't occur, you should tell him to retreat. if it does occur, you should not try to take him away. that is unhealthy.
do not flirt with men who are in a relationship.
do your best to deal with the situation.
i met a man that i enjoy being around, but i am still married. what shall i do about this situation?
how can you tolerate this man?
he wants her to disconnect with each other.
as soon as we get bush's head on straight, we will get equal rights.
i feel lonely when my partner leaves.
believe my, it is worth the wait.
loving a person in spite of their faults.
and that just proves even more that i belong to him!
there are some strange people around, and the neighbor's child throws rocks at me.
ask yourself whom you like better.
i like the way they always try to look their best, although i hate it when it is overdone.
oh, and something more if he is helpful.
it can get better, if you let it.
if you are too shy to ask her out, eventually you will not like her anymore.
how do i tell her that i care about her?
i have dated a guy that was 10 years younger then me.
do you think that he likes me?
we will have been married for five years this july.
i even enjoy talking with him.
no i am 23 years old, and i have returned.
i read dr. phil's book, 'smart love.'
hello you are attractive. do you own a ferrari?
i do not know blue or you, and i do not know what is in a person's heart.
i know that you can do it!
i think that she loves you very much, but she can not express her feelings in a good way.
being too badly burned if the feelings are not mutual?
angelina jolie in a heartbeat!
is it strange to ask in a coded manner?
in my opinion you should move out when you are eighteen before you go to college.
be confident and do not try to use pick up lines.
i do not know if i should continue the relationship or not.
if you are a good person, it should not matter
why would i be able to not have legs like that??)
haha.. better believe it.. everybody here is distorts.. so becareful when you say that...
ask him, i'd wagered he feels the same!
all folks play with young ladies, in the event that they don't, they are unusual.
not each guy needs a indigent young lady.
but the police will look upon you with shifty eyes.
are you joking? because your friend kayla was just here asking the same of you.
i am kind, i am in need of female friends.
let her go, she will return when he ends the relationship.
perhaps that will be the reason you finally are relieved. (5 years?)
i would not lift the restraining order that you applied for.
do not be discouraged by one person.
i like the sound it makes after it bends.
better to play it safe on the first date than to rush things.
i am curious.
im liveing verification , what dont slaughter you will make you more grounded !
it happens constantly.
i simply believe that is clever.
the main individual that i kissed ,is my significant other now .
same ol tune, yet its actual he should be the ones that is forlorn fallin for a star
so what are you asking me?
i would love for you to perform fellatio on me.
that relationship may not last.
i am not strong.
she is not faithful to him.
you are always being observed.
never did i think that he would simply ask me to have an affair with him.
you do not have to do it that way, if you do not want to.
even have recurring dreams for months at a time.
i would then ask her for an opportunity to romance her again with dinner, flowers, dancing, etc.
now, doing it is the last step for you.
"whooo hooo, lock the doors, baby!"
and, if you are a real woman, what a thing to say.
yeah, you can kiss someone with braces even if you have braces yourself.
i've found mine, and we're engaged. yay, me.
why do men hurt women who love them?
when a man tells you to ask for assistance if you need it what is to be understood by this?
i do not understand what the complication is.
i do not allow him to come home.
i began noticing the acts he does including the acts he does not do.
i believe the majority of men prefer long, dark hair unless they like you already.
why would you wamt him back?
for instance,  i will at least listen when my ex-wife says he is a really difficult person.
you should start dating when yiu are mature enough to get married.
well, if he smiled he loved it, and you played sta?
be assertive man, and go get her!
or, on the other hand when she says, i adore you, you answer (or something like) i know.
try not to wind up plainly another victim of his!
no hun that man does not adore you, hes only being unreliable and a butthole
try not to stress, pleasant folks do complete last, however they have pretty spouses, huge houses and truly quick autos!
what is the reason young men undermine young ladies and get frantic when young ladies do it back?!!.
with friends like you, who needs enemies?
you could beat them, an if that does not work, take things away from them.
if they do not say they are preps, then that's why they are calling you a prep.
no worries, being single is much more fun.
at times people have to choose between their love and their best friend.
be yourself, and enjoy life.
it will not work, and it hurts. it is always mr or mrs perfect that are states away.
if you can make it work, there is no need to worry about size.
cartoon gummi bears and piranha have me nightmares. so did the chipminks movie and wild boar.
teach your family not to ask you that.
ask your best friend a few questions.
i agree, but, get rid of the unintelligent people first.
you do not want to feel trapped if you have spent a lot of time with her.
i assume you mean " british"?
if he did truly love you, he would not harm you physically.
change things around so that he will be interested.
i would not call her phone at all.
i want to be with this woman, but i also want to date around.
add some details, and i will answer your question later.
if you are doing this just to have fun, then go ahead.
do not do it; life is not that simple.
this guy told her he could not be seen with her.
just tell him it is over.
there exist gentlemen who adore athletic females.
have you ever thought that perhaps they are genuinely virgins?
if he is not partial to it, advance to the next male.
every male i know gripes of similar issues.
tell him you doubt his love for you.
he has never given up on me.
right when you least expect it.
in addition, i try to get back at him everyday. unfortunately, now he is really attracted to my best friend.
make sure to listen and show her that you are listening.
i believe doing that would be a mistake for you.
why does he refuse to take a chance at creating a relationship with me?
girls of that age tend to be more unstable, given that they're younger, so they tend to play games due to their immaturity.
does your love interest give you the love and attention you're looking for? does he act oddly around you at times?
look, i don't wish for our friendship to end so suddenly.
when i turn eighteen is when my parents will kick me out.
if that is something you would be comfortable with, then go ahead.
the one that makes you talk to the lord; you know, like "oh god yes!".
i think that you should when you find the right guy.
i do not know if i am cute, but if you say so.
i will just mail it to him.
long-distance relationships never work out.
with ebony black eyeballs that have white pupils.
it depends on which state that you are in.
that site is a crock.
you can find love at a stop light, depends on cupid.
he has been wetting his pants all the time.
would you like to have a drink after work sometime?
the girls hair should be done like the era.
i like it when girls put their hand on top of mine or on my shoulder.
it seems like you have noticed signals that he is interesed.
my friend is interested in someone four years older, that's crazy; three years would be acceptable.
why not have sex with as many people as you can while your still able?
i didn't mean a mix such as canadian-american, i meant to refer to something such as spanish-russian, etc.
if you do not want to divorce your husband, definitely do not have relations with another man.
do what is right for yourself and get a fresh start.
if you are interested, what size do you wear?
remember to have fun, be honest with each other, and only swing as a couple.  you are very lucky.
i cannot tell you the details, but it will last forever!
whether he says not over not with stress you will discover other guys you similar to.
if your in the middle of ages 7-12 aren't you too little to bring a boyfriend?
just come on out with it and speak it
pray on it study your spiritual text and generally envision and  pray.
my companion kayla appears like shes playing with me, yet i dislike that!
i need to make the female unattractive.
men of your stature are rare.
not spending enough time with your offspring and significant other can be detrimental, especially when engaging in unethical behavior.
you are not incorrect, but are treading into trouble.
he wants to entertain you in a similar way that levi entertains me.
no matter which decision you choose try to be kind when you make it.
you do not want to make her boyfriend jealous so that he becomes angry with you.
i am still interested regardless of the events that occurred.
regardless of who the gentleman is; one must be true to themselves.
sometimes being careless seems to be achieving one's goals and yet have much more work to do.
it depends on the age difference between the two parties.
it is best to make sure that both parties are in agreement.
she may be of need of assistance, so it is recommended to let her be.
i doubt you could ask a more difficult question to answer.
last valentine's day, i purchased a soccer piggy bank filled with chocolate "hugs and kisses" for him.
if your parents do not mind, and you enjoy it, then forget everyone else's opinion.
so, i say forget about her.
so, i say do what you think is best, and do not even bother with protection.
trust your intuition and be skeptical if something does not seem right with him.
he may be afraid that he cannot fulfill your desires.
more than half of married couples end in divorce.
of all the options that's all i can recall.
most people are not interested in dating an unattractive person.
even though i am an ex model, good looking and in shape, it happens to me.
i need help dealing with my friend asking out my best friend.
she asked out someone else in december, after she broke up with me.
let them know you are christian and would like them to be as well.
david was my best friend whom i married.
he told me that i have beautiful eyes.
they resemble eyes looking at me.
ask her when you can.
before it is too late, i suggest dumping him.
tell her the truth and if she thinks you are weird, then she is not a real friend.
you can do any position if you have an erection.
i met a really lovely girl last summer.
did he help you while you were in school?
i am too wonderful to be cheated on.
i am not attracted to any of the young men at my school, so i am waiting for the right person to come along.
try your best! walk up to her, and ask her if she would like to go!
be strong and firm, and give it time.
on the beach? no. on the couch? maybe. i like the car and the floor because the former is private, and the latter has a signifcant amount of space.
trust me, i am not flirting with you!
he will be a sort of companion.
i need something miraculous to occur.
my ex-partner liked my long hair especially during sexual intercourse.
you are welcome to contact me via e-mail if you need assistance.
it is obvious that you have feelings for her as a significant other or companion.
the answer is not having sex, however, if you are unable to control yourself then use protection such as condoms and birth control medication.
however, divorce does have the tendency to strike fear in some people, both men and women.
if your man does not tell you that you are beautiful then he could be self centered.
spend lots of time with her.
they are unaware of what they have, they are being naive.
if you are serious, take one pill to achieve the best results.
if he is not then look for someone else
no, what i did, he still stood for and could not stop it.
that way it would be easier for me and my fellow women.
i offer you my sympathy. that is a difficult situation.
couples should take turns doing things they each enjoy.
i am 17.  my question is: is that legal.
everyone reaches a point where they must examine their lives.
being homosexual is morally wrong, as is overeating, smoking, cursing, littering, and polluting our world.
some individuals aren't nice, no matter how well you treat them.
do it for your wife.
blonds tend to be fake and over the top, a brunette is a better choice.
something boys like, like a sports item.
hang out with him for a bit, and then ask him out.
just because he doesn't have a camera doesn't mean a lot.
i have no objection to asking a man on a date.
in a humorous turn of events, i am getting married in february of 2010.
it is an achievement that you should be proud of. live your life like a king.
have you attempted to communicate your feelings to her about the matter?
you should take him for every penny that he's worth.
there is a possibility that your brother is content in the fact that her loves her very much.
i beg you!  i will stand by you forever!
it would depend on the girl i will be seeing at the time.
please let me know if i can help you with anything.
having diversity in your interests is a very healthy way to think.
i don't think i've ever heard it said that way.
all you have to worry about is you and your partner.
guys get soft after a while, so sometimes they make mistakes.
if anyone cares, it might be less than eighteen.
the great thing is that i had my best friends around me.
it would be measured by how much compassion you have for her.
if you have god in your life you are doing well.
it depends on how much you care for her.
i have romantic feelings for my friend's ex-boyfriend.
i think you should kiss, take of his pants, and you know the rest.
the place you are in life matters.
just ask her the same way i asked my boyfriend.
a nymphomaniac can only be a girl.
some guys just want to have a girl who is younger.
yes, believe me, you can do it with me.
i hope that this helps you more than it has helped me.
if this makes him distant, then you do not to be in a relationship.
get out of the relationship now!
ask if they want to be married by october 2006.
they are wrong, i don't know why they would say that.
you know you might have a great chance.
we used to hold a conversation all night but things have changed.
i believe it's not a good idea to date your best friend.
i understand what you are feeling.
let's ask this question to him directly and wait for his response.
why are you scared.
no, there are 10,000 more exactly like that one available also.
with that being said, you should move on with your life and try to enjoy it!
they say they do not mean it, but they are lying.
vin diesal and the rock, but definitely not arec barrwin.
don't worry so much about what people think.
go wear it and do it.
eighteen or older; anyone younger is still a child.
would you fight for your love?
find her brother, the 18-year old.
don't just listen to your heart, use your mind too.
i was interrupted by my husband and you took off quickly. maybe next time.
i am a scorpio, i know.
his sister claims she only shows off to me.
ok sweetheart, i had the same thing happen to me.
if he is overly threatened by this after only three weeks, run.
it keeps you interested and caring.
if there is a build-a-bear workshop in your town, that always works.
his priorities are out of alignment.
are you a girl and are you just curious?
consider taking a trip to the doctor first, and ensure there is nothing truly wrong.
walk up to him and say, "hi."
it is all up to you.
his friends there will tease him about it.
i last seven or eight minutes before i am finished. afterward, i need a sandwich and a beer.
you do not watch the series "friends?"
are you actually in love with her? or are you experiencing infatuation, lust, or some other emotion?
i forgot to give the "courtesy tap."
he may ask you out. if he does not, then simply say you want to go out on friday.
my friend, i should not start talking about that.
very much, funny. perhaps that is because my boyfriend is deployed overseas, and it has been a while.
being with more than one person is alright if that is your preference. i think it is best to be with just one person.
do you understand what i'm saying?
forget about who everyone thinks you should date.
by the say, good birthday, dear!
masturbation is normal, don't let them tell you that it is not.
young girls usually do not date guys their age.
is it too early to know?
you can't force him to love you.
you don't want to forget your mother so you hang onto trinkets from her.
afterwards you and your friends should go somewhere.
that could destroy her life and marriage.
some men are nice, and some are too kind.
i suppose it is best that i did not.
hello, my name is mostafa and i am from egypt. i am in search of a spouse.
it is if he says that he enjoys your company.
they look attractive each day just to do so.
more power to you for liking something that i do not. enjoy it while it lasts.
you will know what you need to do if things don't go the way you want.
how would you feel if a 35-year-old man had sex with your 18-year-old daughter?
it is right under the head.
you, me and my dad all agree.
do you really want to be second choice?
a male is reactive without concerning himself with details.
i went through a similar ordeal.
another man has interest in her.
they will be found when least expected.
determine if he has interest in you or not.
yes, the breaking up and i was just kidding.
half of my friends are male, and i consider them brothers.
sit on him and move around.
if this eighteen year old man makes you happy, then enjoy it.
i have always followed my heart and now is it leading me to you. what do you think?
think about it this way; if you were married, would you want your wife having intercourse with someone else?
if she is upset or worried that means that she cares. if she doesn't react then she doesn't care.
ok here is more information that i have received.
if you show him that you are interested in him then he will feel more comfortable asking!
what do you think i should do?
it is easier, unless you're shy.
if i had more to lose, i would accept.
ask your partner what they enjoy.
they're probably cheating or have no trust in you.
just try to get lucky and wait for her to leave you?
i am looking for some sexually attractive lingerie for size xxl and upward.
i have attempted sexual relations with my wife, but have thus far failed.
begin perceiving him the way you used to perceive him.
i received a satisfactory answer, charmer.
i do not perceive you as a timid person.
if you desire you may marry your first cousin.
you do not trust her much.
it shows you care for them.
do all that you can to arouse him.
is there someone that understands the situation that i am in, and could possibly help me seek answers?
he did it just to sleep with her.
wear good clother, look presentable and be nice.
do avatars have nice personalities?
who ever i talk to he tells them to back off.
let her know that you don't like it when she talks about her ex's.
you do have to choose.
in my opinion, chris brown is to light skinned and tall to be considered cute.
you already know the answer.
do you really need a same sex marriage?
in my opinion, intercourse between two scorpio's is the best there is.
no tongue kissing on the first date.
he may not necessarily be cheating; he could just find you boring.
some guys are really just for being friends with.
i would not worry too much about it.
you need to tell her parents or a teacher.
do not give in because all he wants is sex.
i believe it may be possible.
i would say to not do that.
his company will look into it.
i am positive he likes me as well.
i think you understand what i am trying to say.
it takes a lot but i don't like how hard you're on yourself.
we have to lose them to get some peace and quite.
think about how poor he was and that should help.
to begin with it sounds like he has the wrong idea.
yes of course, because red is one of my favorite colors.
this isn't a friendly relationship, just showing compassion.
my advice is to leave if you're not happy, why are you still there?
it would help if you could meet an european lady.
remove his pants while he watches sports on television, and orally pleasure him.
i'm not comfortable answering this question.
i suggest that you get to know each other first, and then see how the relationship unfurls.
i do not understand why you would want to have an affair with someone who ended a relationship with you.
i am a doctor, so trust when i say that you are a virgin until you have penetrative intercourse.
if you re frightened, inform her as you could pontentially be harmed.
depends as to what you are implying by the term "arranged."
there are a few rather attractive african american gentlemen there.
alas, this is what i believe you should do.
it is similar to breasts, and perhaps intercourse.
it sounds like any average crush.
one might say women do not know why they do it, they just do.
she will either answer or not. because you know them and she thinks she is going to tell.
you can get his number and you call him.
you should wait untill you are married.
i agree with rascal, you should get pictures.
i am ashley's older sister. i am 14 years old.
you should leave your problems behind.
how much more experience would you like to get?
don't settle. find someone you love.
is there a reason you are not supposed to like him?
i do not believe you are a lesbian.
do not worry sweetie, it will not last.
go on being happy with your life.
do whatever you want, just do no get into trouble.
what can i do to better my chances of winning her back?
i am not going to sneak about as if we are doing something wrong.
she is your past, let it go man, i hate it when my friend phil says that.
the guy does not even know how to use it, but, the lady does!
i did, sort of, after my first try.
she had to mentally mature at a young age.
where are you from? i am from washington d.c.
getting along with your life is a lie.
wait until one comes to you.
i like him, he likes me and is really cute, but his sister hates me!
adultery is a serious crime.
come on, it is you first cousin, think of your future children.
you will not waste anymore time on self doubt.
a lover is easier to find than a genuine friend.
find a partner that was nerdy.
he is handsome and a talented singer.
to some girls, pulling out the make-up bag may be funny.
well, unless you turn into a nun, you will get married.
me and women both are concerned about their performance.
their opinions are irrelevant to me.
if the woman you are interested in is in a relationship, you need to pursue someone else.
i try my best to be strong, but when it comes to that i am weak.
i do not care what age you are, or if you are having sex.
she does not like potatoes.
most girls like guys who are slightly bad.
nothing too big or serious, it is only the first date, you have time!
you are thirteen, you would wait until you hit puberty first.
you just need to coax it.
i have been cheated on and it was a horrible experience, nothing but a nightmare!
if he is handsome, yes.
he is afraid to pursue them.
he doesn't consume alcohol.
it sounds like she needs to let go.
thank you for you opinions, but i was joking.
i hope you find what you need!
if you are honest and can trust each other, there is no reason to be jealous.
if he likes to watch television
how should i win his affections again?
talk to his friends.
why don't you just start over fresh and forget about the past?
the two of you would be very unhappy.  in the end, you would wind up cheating and would hate each other.
do you have a romantic interest on the internet?
do not settle for someone who cheats or is a jerk.  you deserve better!
i have really great friends who are girls, and we can just be friends.
yes, i have some friends who are female.
yes, in that circumstance it will not hurt much when you are married and you will be experienced, which men find attractive.
you should converse with me, saleem_nawaz, and we will speak briefly.
i know that i have told that to many men; however, i was sincere.
if you love and trust her, overlook this.
why are you involved with a married woman at all?
it is not a question, of course the answer is eminem!
i find this very amusing, you must really appreciate this lady. i am laughing in amazement!
even women will appreciate a little challenge.
take as much time as necessary to please a lady.
waiting and socializing until something presents itself as entertainment.
first, draw her a hot bath. after that, undress her, gently lift her, and place her into the water.
my wife is aware of the fact that i have many female friends, and she trusts me regardless.
in the long run, a good man will respect you for it.
place it gently as it arrives.
she will love you just as she did in the beginning.
we don't understand.
if you don't then it is your issue.
mail it, or give it to a friend.
it is possible, but it could be someone who is 97 and aging.
she was not nice, and didn't treat him well.
you are not attracted to women.
it may hamper the relationship if you intervene.
why is he staring at you?
they do not state that in the beginning.
why do i attract males that are below my standard?
if you do not experience attraction towards women.
do not be arbitrary with either of them because it could damage the relationship.
ask why he is staring at you.
and, of course, they do not tell them that directly.
why is it that i attract only impoverished men with many children and concealed weapons?
provide them with all the information you have and to be careful.
is there a difference whether the male were older or younger than the female?
most people are unsure about what they did.
it surprises me that anyone thinks differently.
he is not serious with you, he is only playing games.
do you still want to spend time with her?
i did ate around a bit, but i thought i had nothing to fear.
you should just accept the gift and be happy with it.
she is behaving like the average woman.
i manipulated him, it may have been wrong but it worked for me.
the police will get involved.
they are usually fake.
no he still doesn't care for you.
i can handle both at once.
if she left you then she is a loser, and does not love you anymore. i would get over it and move on.
many people would say that they are not really happy.
try to connect with this person, but if you cannot then do not even try to go there.
yes, you should do the things that make you happy, be with the people who make you happy, and not worry about what people thought.
forget her. find someone who actually appreciates you.
well when you think about it, gay men have sex with other men.
although i do not think it is.
whites are usually 5-6 inches, hispanics are 7-8 inches, and blacks are 7-9inches.
break up with him. she can do better.
if that is what you're asking, then you are not going insane.
it's possible that the type of girl you're looking for doesn't go to your school.
i tend to prefer brunettes, but i am not opposed to blondes.
she has plans to lay down and relax on a bed of very green grass.
of course, right now. i don't know if he is interested in me, but i am certainly interested in him.
by the way... my girlfriend is not bisexual or she has not tried it, but finds it also is a turn on.
if so, then i would say so.
just ask him or do not if you never want to know.
he is just trying to protect his girlfriend.
when i look at a girl, of course at first we see how she looks.
invite him to your next wedding.
i understand, i know you are having a hard time.
not all men are bad.
i had already had four boyfriends by the time i was thirteen.
the wedding is in april. the colors are lavender and white, with fresh cut flowers in huge vases on the head table.
don't try to be someone you are not.
that is, if you both want to.
youmhave to be in love first if the sexual part will be any good.
if she does not like potatoes, just finish yours and she can eat what she wants to eat.
the two if you have different opinions about buying shoes, but that does not mean she will stop buying them.
i feel that some men have low cognitive function.
madam, may i suggest that firstly you see which one takes a liking to you.
i'm kyla. nice to meet you.
happy wedding day. if you haven't already, i suggest that you get a karaoke machine.
how do you think she will react if you irritate or bore her?
i would enjoy being asked out by a girl.
you need to make yourself the priority if he is being unfaithful.
infatuation is fleeting, but true love is not.
we are more like acquaintances and can go months without intimacy.
one caveat is that there are attractive 33 year old men as well.
it is not as complicated as a man asking a woman on a date.
after he placed the ring on my finger, he no longer had any interest in me.
not at age 13. it is eighteen years old for both men and women in the united states.
it sounds like nothing at all is wrong with you.
if you use them as examples they will realize how unfair and childish they are being.
as you know, i spend time on the computer which keeps me from getting anything done.
it is my opinion that you should not drop out.
experience has taught me this.
it is a great way to spend time with others.
a church function is the best way to spend your time.
i don't think they are close friends.
they may have mized feelins and don't know how to love you.
buff means that they have a strong appearance.
it isn't good or bad, it is an opinion.
don't go back even if they say they've changed.
i would break up with him!
if the right guy really is out there, when is he going to get here?
say hello and be nice!
they have been dating for about two months.
i thought they were just kidding around, no man has a problem of that magnitude.
try always to grasp what his point of view is, and never try to attack his ego.
your points may not be well taken, if he continues to ignore all outside views, other then is own.
i resent the fact that two cute girls are fawning, over a male that doesn't know they are around.
making lots of money, is a way for a lot males with self-esteem issues to compensate for their self-esteem problems.
it is of no concern to others whether or not she has feelings for the gentleman.
you may not believe so, but you do harbor strong feelings for the gentleman.
with the lack of love people would procreate such as those of the canine species without any emotions.
spend more quality time with him by talking and flirting.
in the end it does not really matter.
she said that he liked me.
meet up with him and be honest when you tell him why.
when you see that man be yourself and do what your heart says at that time.
i first met baby's father when he was a picture perfect man.
i am not a huge loving person, but i do know what love is about.
i'm told he just doesn't go with me.
next time i'll find someone better.
he still makes me nervous.
the child subject makes sex harder.
he doesn't give you gifts for your birthday, or holidays?
should one sleep with his brother or his best friend?
one seems to be much older than the other participants.
allow your friend to be happy by giving her the opportunity of being with him.
what is your name, and also, why does she have to be of a different race?
i thought i was in love.
firstly, it has to do with your age.
ask him to stop staring at you.
a child should not have to grow up listening to arguing and violence.
in my experience, it rarely lasts.
you have to be careful with that.
if your sister told you to holdon, then come back, she is not here.
only if you like alot of sex.
but there are some guys who cover it up by marrying women.
now that i answered it i am not so bored anymore...hey, thank you.
i am having a napoleon dynamite moment..you could do as pedro does and make her a cake?
you can subtly drop hints and maybe he will ask you out on a date.
a person who is shy may look at you because they are afraid to make a move.
he is always saying sweet things to me and about me to others.
feelings, including love, come and go.
i honestly think that some people are undecided when it comes to who or what they want.
let him know how you feel and he may just ask you out on a date.
he compliments me all the time.
if it's not true love it will end.
honestly they are not sure about what they want.
has anyone ever informed you that you have difficulty succeeding in social matters?
i suggest that you cease eating them.
i have been involved in a similar circumstance to this before, and what i found most effective was kindness.
ask him directly and do not hesitate.
what is it that i am not doing, or should not be doing?
as a matter of first importance is she the one for u, at that point u shouldn't stress over being embarrased.
no one ought to be anybodys punching sack it is quite recently off-base.
i have heard that brunette is recently latin for blonde wanna be :-p
obviously it's conceivable have a fabulous time
they generally need the awful young men.
anyone why says 'hi' is a girl, and a woman says 'hello.' just observe.
june 2006? it sounds like he needs to graduate from somewhere.
she was not the one. why?
i have 3 different friends, buy they do not know eachother.
if you are only interested in sex, then do not marry anyone.
if you ask her to go on a date she will go with you.
give them time to understand.
there is good and bad in everything, being married for example.
to many guys ask me out, i don't need to ask them.
he wants to be with you so he hasn't told her yet.
raising your children in that kind of situation will influence their future decisions.
i am 19 and still searching for a real man.
you only live once so live it well.
your children will be raised believing it is okay, when it really is not.
i weighed 98lbs when we got married and now i weigh 140lbs.
i really miss it, can you tell?
i do not see what is wrong with you looking at another woman and saying "she looks nice".
that depends on what type of guy he is. but both i guess.
i really like the girl, so i want it to be nice.
your actions will keep you out of trouble and on the right path.
remember, you are a helper; give him love and encouragement.
what is wrong with you, of course men want that.
i am very sorry to say, but i believe he likes her.
have you ever done anything to her that would cause her to not like you?
i am going to wait until after i am married.
take the time to look inward, then, go and get him.
it was strange. i was suprised that people actually enjoy that.
if you tell her and she is normal herself, she is sure to break up with you.
you can flirt with him sometimes when you are together, but do not go overboard.
there is nothing wrong with that you are doing, just be honest with him.
it is so wrong for me to date a guy !
in the meantime, get friendly with some ladies five to ten years older than you.
in my opinion a great many people confuse lust with true love.
of course, if the individual is mean, or intoxicated.
if as a couple you began with nothing, a prenuptial agreement would be an insult.
show him that you support him, and gradually give him your love.
of course i don't know everything regarding my wife's past.
my situation is better than having four husbands!
they act that way because they find you attractive and want to have a relationship with you.
i don't mind staring at men.
discuss the positive and negatives.
i wonder how many people would want to answer this question.
yes, it shows you have good taste!
the number of questions is overwhelming.
the odd thing is that they married each other.
it's not that they aren't knowledgeable - they are just very confused at the moment.
it is never acceptabil to victimize and prey on young girls.
it would be better for you to extricate yourself from the relationship.
it is difficult to find respectful men today, and that is exactly what you need!
to find time to spend with you.
your abrupt defensiveness informs me that you are too young for me.
take his hand, and ask him on a date!
lust at first sight, yes.
he would have to pay alimony for the rest of her life or until she gets remarried.
i feel like i can do better on my own.
sometimes he has intercourse in bathrooms and other seedy places and she never knows.
that means that if one spouse is caught cheating, the other gets everything and he gets nothing.
would you like to have a cup of coffee together sometime?
i think that it should be for marriage only.
when it comes to blue, there are not many blue flowers.
this guy also sounds like it.
girls like men who have skills such as being a handyman with a personality and bowstaff.
as long as one must think about sexual relations, does he like it?
i love my boyfriend greatly.
i hope this elucidates the subject better.
if you broke up with her, then i doubt she will want to get back in a relationship with you.
now, i understand why it is best to wait.
this is not a difficult problem and i think most of you are mistaken.
the age of 18 is challenging for many.
the solution is some lubrication, such as ky jelly, and a lot of foreplay.
you should just wait for the right single guy.
in addition, should she say no, ask her to explain why.
you should be just as good a person on the outside as you are on the inside.
i think you should tell the police.
if at all possible, the woman should separate herself for a time.
that is a great question, however the answer is "not as many as i do".
typically, guys are not very good at getting subtle hints.
just the thought makes me uncomfortable.
jealousy can escalate to abuse quick, please be careful.
she would mention it to you.
my boyfriend is like that, it is overbearing.
he likes you if he teases you.
i plan on remaining with this man for the foreseeable future.
he was not receptive of my advances.
would you want to do first:  exchange photos or telephone numbers?
you seem to be tight-knit.
they seem to begin after you have finished.
they would not grow accustomed to that life style.
as of july 2014, the exchange rate for the indian rupee (inr) was 46.13 per one us dollar.
i certainly would not enjoy being around someone who behaves as you do.
you are cheating on him with your boyfriend!
i often think of sex.
men are rude, but they will participate to have sex with a woman.
do you know what is like for a child to know their mother is abused?
boyfriends/girlfriends come and go, don't let your friendships go for a partner.
bet on paper chips, go for the winner.
i think you should change your style.
why would any day matter if not on your honeymoon?
i approve of this.
contemplate all the activities you do well and enjoy them with friends.
there seems to be back to back financial crisis.
i still love her and if given the opportunity i would not hesitate to return to her.
keep yourself busy and stop thinking about when he is going to call.
i am asking this question to find out how many girls actually fake it and why.
yes but it gives the other 40% of us something to laugh about.
perhaps you just do not feel ready yet.
nathan in the bible.
the most appropriate manner in which to inform a lady you no longer wish to be her paramour is to be honest.
keep us informed as to what occurred.
but, the saying is, "if you love something, let it go. if it comes by, then it is real."
but, five months is of no importance.
if you do not adore her any longer, inform her and do not harm her.
it is right next to the vein on the underside of the phallus.
i would like to know what to do.
i am content with what makes me happy.
i feel that women sometimes find another man to get back at their ex.
he is sixteen and cute.
depend on your mother and father for your livelihood.
it is because the male originated first and the woman second, so males had sexual desire first.
it is a new year so hopefully you have good fortune.
some strangers ask anything because they do not know you.
she did not know that i gave it to him until last night.
i sure hope that there are no children involved!
i told my best friend and she got mad and we didn't hang out for about 2 months.
probably some guy who does not broadcast it.
don't buy it with their money, or buy something really expensive they they will never use.
what you see is what you get women.
you are not meeting the right women.
thank you for sharing your impressions about what is happening in my life.
surround yourself with male friends--men who respect you-- and with whom you are comfortable.
if she rejects you, there are other pretty women available.
it takes time to forget things although he manages to do so the second time.
my goodness, there are so many conservatives in the area.
good luck to you, cigarettes are all right.
how about that ! what are your going to do now ?
please, find a close friend that might explain some of our lower points.
lies always hurt, and they will always backfire.
as long as you love him, it shall be fine.
alas, it could be a band.
dearest, i went to the doctor where i was told that i have a sexually transmitted disease.
my former paramour was unfaithful which lead to our falling out currently.
unbelievable, dear lady, you are thirty-three years of age, yet you appear to be more similar to my own age?
i didn't intend to go out with him.
also, gracious my god, why might you remain with some wedded washout at any rate.
rather than hanging out with them, now you hang out with your uncommon somebody, yes?
young ladies don't normally get frantic, they get even.
so be it...she needs another closet?
she is constantly with you to ensure you are not doing anything she disapproves of.
do you think that you got it from him?
you know it is special if she cares for your family and friends.
whenever i sense her getting more serious, i get nervous and fail to reciprocate.
i am sexy, you should get to know me!
just speak with her and treat her like anyone else.
it depends on what you're purchasing, likely.
we used to do those things, why have we stopped?
i'm an attractive man, will that work for you?
i am not usually shy around her so i am not sure why it happened this time.
i am a female who has been through similar experiences so i can lend you my thought on the topic.
that 18 year old sure did find himself in a lucky situation.
the reason that love hurts because of the fear of losing that person in the future.
my email address is sexyniceeyes_15@yahoo
trust me you do not and you will not for years
you do not know what this guy is like
are you sure it matter's to you?
you are going to have very hard times.
soon if you would like, but late if you are not interested.
if you are a man it is different.
what did you do to lose her?
she does not hate you, she is just annoyed with you.
time and experience are among them.
when your desires are not fulfilled then that hurts.
if she could do what your mom can do for you.
do not be stupid and do not start dating!
i actually like this guy a lot.
i have to be honest.
after that, it becomes a combination of appearance and personality.
you should make her feel important and special.
how can a relationship change from electric to boring?
i use e-mail so that i have the potential to make relationships on this site.
the truth hurts but he will move on.
my signifiant other and i are having issues.
i am not sure who to chose, this is a tough decision.
i do not understand why jennifer aniston and brad pitt seperated.
you can't live together and still attend high school?
size matters, however it is just one factor in the whole pleasure experience.
my best friend is male, we've been friends since we were two.
i hope he isn't bigger than you.
it would not bother me in the least.
that is a clear sign you need to break up.
the two things that help me to clear my head are running, or there is beer.
you should make a billion dollars acting in the movies and then ask her.
i am 13, and there is this nice girl who moved here 4 days ago.
indeed, however, i pay no attention to salma hayek's attorney, who unrelentingly menace me with a restraining order.
inquire it of her, because the worst case scenario is that her reply will be a refusal.
in many instances, women refrain from purchasing presents for men at all.
take my advice, each time you return to an old romantic acquaintance, it only exacerbate the matter.
present him with a box of chocolate confections.
then you should say, "one for you...one for me...one for you".
you're still too young to date; i'm not going to date until i'm 18.
all you have to do is touch a guy and he's arounds...just joking.
"help" is right...hide the kids.
do whatever he wants, especially in bed, whenever he wants to.
he was revealed to be obnoxious.
you do not know this man. he may be armed. do not meet him.
you may end up losing your relationship if you sell yourself short.
this is a dumb question, but i thought i would be able to get opinions from some people. thank you.
it took you 16 years to establish what type of person she really was.
as a 13 year-old, i feel confident in what i am doing.
if you are friendly, you will have a lot of friends.
should i give it a chance?
you do not have to worry, i am not gay.
it will make you more likable and gain friends.
do not extend a relationship by making him think you love him.
he will give you one.
(not to mention, she typed all in caps, and it was one big run-on sentence.)
i would tell him face to face.
thirteen is too early to start dating.
maybe the guy that is mean to you likes you!
how can you love someone when you do not even know any of their inner characteristics?
do you think you're boyfriend is either gay or fat?
hopefully, they break up, if they don't you will just have to live with it.
the deception alone is wrong.
if all he is doing is staring, that's not considered stalking.
why would you want a friend that you don't know?
if that is the case all men of puerto rican descent would be taken.
you deserve to be treated better. snooping is not as bad as what she did.
why can't females buy things with their own money?
in a relationship, one person is always working harder than the other.
she is intelligent along with her three siblings.
it's time to move on and find a man that is more suited to you.
i would love to find out if i like it, maybe i'll try it twice.
getting her to stop this is harder than i thought, any suggestions?
my boss is married, and i'm in love with him.
tough day at work? listen to the stories and laugh at your jokes.
what is the most attractive way to pleasure yourself?
he is legally and adult are you are legally a minor.
love is blind, who cares about race?
i just want to know.
i agree, he is the most attractive.
i did in the past, but i haven't got a response other than in writing. they are all afraid.
if another man is interested in her, leave her alone.
the question is, who doesn't like him?
the fact is, i don't like him.
if not once, you will need to allow him to go.
well, you are correct in that regard. try using the other hand instead.
some of my closest friends are men.
is that your true desire?
if they want it again then they are likely to call sooner rather than later.
perhaps he does like you. a friend once dated a man who she hates in every way.
as for when to take it off, never.
this does not sound good at all.
do not listen to girls, they are so dramatic.
however, we all want things to be back to the way they were.
chances are that your friends are jealous because this guy is crazy about you.
this stuff should have never happenned. should i have a good argument?
you are halfway there- knowing this information.
you need to go and get a life. men sicken me.
i really doubt it, but i was just wondering.
love is so much more then outward apperances.
it's no question, chris brown.
i couldn't understand why, because he said he loved me.
set ground rules for what is and what is not allowed before you begin.
then, begin exercising fanatically, dieting and similar behaviors.

well, i am a shy guy so i know all about this.
live your life and wait patiently for things to come when the time is right.
it is not bad at all to think that way!

asking on the phone or through e-mail is weak, childish, and un-personal in my opinion.
i think that sidney portea is very attractive.
if she has a nice figure and you aren't careful.
does he bring you many gifts and flowers?
first, i am unsure why he is in love with me!
ask them questions that make them reflect themselves. i assure you.
do things that are distasteful, such as being unfaithful, and be sure that she is aware of your decisions!
at 14 years of age, however i am a male and we are different. we do not wait for the correct one.
does he regret forgetting?
be gracious and mature about it.
if he calls you when he is having a bad day, tell him, "deal with it. you chose to leave."
have intercourse with him if you really love him; not because you have heard that black men have big penises.
if it is just the sex you are interested in, then talk about any others you like.
he is not worth ruining your life over.
it is not only men.
you should attempt to find out why she dislikes you first.
i have six childern and my partner loves to be intimate.
i would die a hundred deaths for her.
it depends on what and who you are referring to.
if you truly love him, then you are going to have to endure it.
as mentioned, the what if guy, is the one to worry about.
do not stess over it, it will pass, and it may happen again.
he just broke up with someone and i really want him back.
my kids will have a hard time with this.
saying it without saying it, that is a contradictory statement.
if she really is your best friend, then she will forgive you.
he has much higher standards.
i would not change anything if i were you.
hawaii is a great place for a honeymoon.
focus on making yourself happy.
if you would rather reside with your cousin amy, you should.
they are human, just like you.
i would like to have you as a friend, however, i do not want my e-mail made public.
on my sister's 21st birthday, her significant other did not do anything for her.
if the man makes the first move, yes, but you should take it slow.
if you really are interested in her, then it is worth an attempt.
i am young and i know a bit about colors.
perhaps a grandfather with a girl your niece's age would be odd.
you need to leave this relationship with him quickly, and bring the children with you.
and the 'one' will arrive eventually.
sometimes they do it just to be odd in a certain way.
if everything is legal, do it, if both sides enjoy the sex, it takes the guilt out of action.
i believe i did not spell right, oh my).
you seem like you have a lot of solutions...great!
you will not have to do anything, it will last a couple of weeks, and go away on its own.
what would prevent him from abusing them?
in most cases, young girls are more mature than boys of the same age.
i would suggest that you refrain from doing that as well.
i am sorry that i have to tell you difficult information.
i would like to be able to continue a relationship with both of the men that i have a loving relationship with.
i am accompanying the other female, and though it is a personal decision to be doing what you are doing, you really should decide against it.
i would appreciate it if you would assist me.
if you do something that you must hide from your spouse, then it is wrong.
even though there are most likely many questions like this already, i feel the need to ask.
i can fit my clothes now that i have lost a few pounds.
i need your assistance.
you should not keep any thing from your spouse.
if she left, you probably shouldn't try to get her back.
women can fall out of love the same way men do.
simply put, she is not in love with you.
if takes 15-30 minutes that is fine, let her take her time.
it is best be understanding for the two of you, and remain friends.
i would be the happiest man alive if i had a wife like that.
tell them how you feel.
lady,it might not have been you.
what if my neighbors were in a gay marriage?
he will always desire her.
younger women are sexy, of course
it is senseless to me, because i have a way of doing things methodically.
if you really cannot tell the wife outright, you should become her friend first.
if she smiles a lot while talking to you, she is probably attracted to you.
playing hard to get isn't a great tactic.
men dislike arguments after a woman finds him cheating.
when you mature, you will find out life isn't all fun and games.
you have to go through with it.
i haven't found it yet, but i hope one day i will.
to be honest, i would not .
i do not want to tell you.
a male who honestly does not care.
they probably will not listen to you.
a man who does not have good intentions with you is not worth anything.
a marreid man should not be looking for any one other than his wife.
when will you be getting married?
compare your case using photos. i hope this information was useful to you.
that first individual whom you loved and could not be satisfied.
it is your imagination as males tend to encourage themselves.
but, there is shame in one partner only receiving rather without reciprocating.
what are you implying by there are different ways?
hormones, love- a variey of reasons, actually.
you should just let it go.
no doubt he will say yes, if you ask him that you like him.
wrong, a guy should of asked you out.
probably just some of the things that run through his mind.
a favorite sports item like a hat or a shirt.
if you like him, and want a relationship with him, you should not tell him until he answers you.
in some cases, men want to know that they have a woman wrapped around their fingers.
this goes for men too.
it cost too much to get anything.
they have so much to lose.
would any of you girls date a masochistic guy- that is into bondage and things like that?
what good is a honeymoon if you do not?
do not worry about it.
if you love someone, you do not count.
do not think of having sex with him.
in my opinon men don't take offense to arguments.
you can be nice and caring, although some people don't like it if you go overboard.
if he is a nice guy you should ask him out.
use your fingers and plenty of lubrication.
if you have mixed feelings about it and he asks you out, give him a chance.
yes, it is a sad moment when you realize that you must choose between two people.
think about what it will be like in ten or twenty years.
even if the relationship does not work, i think it is best if you allow them to find you.
yes, i would love my boyfriend to death and i would die for him.
be agreeable to him and forget what your benefactors dictate.
only if you are a hopeless romantic, ignorant lady.
currently we are together again and happier than before.
email me if you have any problems with that.
did you say all that in one breath because that was a lot.
my 3rd cousin and down is fine, otherwise it is too nasty.
do not waste a single tear on your past partner again because that would be a waste of time.
he may not notice because he is too busy lookin at other women, so you should leave this loser.
what great answers, especially the one above. continue the good work.
if anything, send them to his house.
you interfered with something.
i will tell you why they do it.
you should not marry this new man.
however, if you do not subscribe to one of them, you are probably out of luck.
have you ever heard the saying "if they do it with you, they will do it to you"?
as others have said, marriage should be focused on more than responding to one person's sexual demands.
that is not right. just be honest.
if anyone is willing to help, i would very much appreciate the assistance.
it has never worked for me gentlemen, they will always seem to require more soon or later.
the spot is where you are standing.
if you like him profess on valentine's day. i will hope a positive outcome for you.
i am a nerd type, but i am a very nice person.
he ended our relationship to return to his previous girlfriend.
i hope your life insurance is paid.
i did not think it was possible for a guy to be that sexy.
that how you propose to a girl if you are in his position.
i am looking to date or talk on the internet or in person.
if you truly love the person, then you would go through with it.
absolutely not -- what are you trying to teach your kids?
first of all, don't play hard, we guys hate it.
if i want more my man can rise to the occasion and give it to me once again.
it is okay if you still like him -- don't give into her.
to what is this world coming?
i am 43 years old, and am not deterred by taboos. color is not a turn off for me. selfish, greedy men are, however.
it is not easy being gay, kid. to say the least.
i am ready to be an honest lover.
so they play these childish games.
i have now begun a relationship with a great woman.
i would suggest that you get her a card, or a music cd by yes.
it is the way that they are able to get your attention.
love at first sight is like a fairy tale.
men are not aware when women are interested in them.
if he returned today and then asked me to forgive him, re-enter a relationship with him, and join a marriage.
unless you are a man, then i suppose you would choose another decision. possibly, you would enjoy that decision.
it seems as if things are moving very quickly, especially if you had met on the internet.
some men do this also, and many women will not.
my opinion is that some women should not worship these type of men, or rather any man.
it helps to flirt with nice women.
if she doesn't quit, then i am not quite sure.
i like chris brown, all of my friends love him as well. they would die for him, how crazy is that?
it is because most of them don't have any real friends.
do you find women with defined bicep and tricep muscles attractive?
i think i should mention that i have had many large black men with average size penises.
he is not good with money and has bounced many checks recently.
karma has come back to bite you, especially now that you are aware of her relationship.
one of you must be a homosexual.
some men can be horrible or rude individuals.
have you asked her that when you are angry?
may i help you?
i sincerely believe that a friend will always be a friend.
i wonder if there actually is an answer to that question?
men prefer to be the one to make the first move when dating.
i think about it nearly all day long.
husbands and wives should both submit to each other.
there are times love is strengthened by working out difficult issues.
some women try to stay in a relationship for reasons other than love and it rarely works.
think about it, irresponsible and cheap is not what you want.
only some girls.
you don't know the answer, so even though you are interested in his question you can't answer.
a cost effective and romantic option is a picnic in the park.
respect yourself, decide how you feel and just be yourself.
when we broke up, i was devastated, but he stuck by my side.
she is mean and unsuccessful.
if he did not, there would be no reason to have sex with you.
now, i would like to address the rest of your issue.
emperors did it and they were praised for it. therefore, i think i should be able to as well.
i am seventeen and my signifiant other is twenty.
i once read in a fortune cookie that "a best friend is one soul in two bodies".
i have a difficult time getting in "the mood".
i do not believe so, people have different opinions.
the only way is to simply tell them.
many gay men find it very difficult to come to terms with.
he is jealous of the attention that you get from others, so he tries to keep you to himself.
there are so many questions and so many answers.
do others agree with me in thinking that she is attractive and friendly?
i am married and have a 19 month old daughter.
get rid of, literally?
they have a lot of women that age on the yahoo personal page.
she is joking, everyone knows it.
they are trying to direct attention at you because they are cheating and do not want to be caught.
women complain about men not listening, while men don't listen because women complain.
i was in sixth grade, and he missed my graduation.
yes, if you love them very much.
that person could just be very insecure, or they don't anyone you socialize with.
because, we cannot change anyone using arguments.
if i were a man, i would prefer c-cup breast size, small waist, large hips and thick legs.
because i love her very much.
tell her you'd like to speak with her online friends, because you'd like to be apart of her life.
be sure that your best qualities are well polished and that you're ready to shine when it finally happens.
if you still love him all you have to do is rekindle the flame.
perhaps you may learn of his fault, and decide you love him regardless.
i would like to be friends first.
flowers would not be the best thing that you could send to your man.
because children are involved, it is a very awful thing.
i would sure go out with that picture in an instant.
she is your ex, why do you care so much?
chances are they are too conceited and do not deserve the time and day to go out with.
it depends if you really care about this girl, and if she feels the same in return.
or just going to a dance club or a party and dancing romantically.
we can be aquitances if you like.
i still like her and i try to avoid her now.
there is this child that bothers me often, he does not like me.
i am attempting to spare his feelings.
if you love him, it should not matter.
that is what you are doing.
she wants jasmine rice, you should let her eat it.
you can not get her to stop.
if she does not kiss you right away, leave.
why not hang out with her when you can; maybe you guys will become closer, and see what happens.
there are things guys want to do.
i work with this woman who is lazy, and does not do her job.
pursuing a relationship with him could potentially damage your friendship.
my opinion is that a woman should leave that particular situation.
he may get upset if you choose not to answer the phone but do not stress about his anger.
they love and respect you, but they also want to sleep with you.
no lies, games and safe sex.
i know based on my own experiences with women.
you cannot do it, it is human nature.
does he have a nice friend? have sex with him and tape it.
she takes her time and watches me work, it drives me crazy.
you should take a vacation, relax, and have some fun.
did she inform you that she did not like it or pull away?
i believe that honesty is the best way to combat jealousy.
why would you not inform her if there is nothing going on?
that is the reason, the more females, the meaner they are.
i dated someone much older than i, it didn't work out.
he is really attractive, but i didn't think he was interested in me, what do i do?
sex, it is hard for me to love.
ye, you get married when you're in love.
i was married to this guy, but i thought of my ex a lot.
they placed our story and picture on the front page of their publication.
i am also interested in additional information.
firm quality with no variation.
i am not a less than ideal person as i am popular within my social circle.
do not hesitate to ask him.
we love it when we are asked out,it let's us know we look good.
really,i do not think either matters.
above all,stay true to yourself.
i can not believe you lied to me!
could it be that you just like drama?
if you really have feelings for her, you can wait.
isn't it a nice day for a training run?
i'm sorry, but popular isn't anything but a word!
just ask, and then you'll know.  if you're not open to something, it won't happen.
i think you should ask her that question.
you need to just tell him that no, you do not wish to go out with him.
finally, i gave him the remainder of the bag.
i have heard the bow wow is getting married to ciara.
i am also infatuated by this person.
just because you know each other does not mean you have to rush into things!
patrick would like to know where the women are.
inside of my band, even says once upon a dream.
my advice to people out there is that don't get married until you are 35 years old.
if you love him then you need to help him overcome this habit that he currently has.
my friend has been married for 25 years.
my husband had an affair with friends, so i am not quite sure.
i cannot answer this question but i advise you speak to your mother instead.
honestly, most men were not created for marriage.
but if your intent is to love,
do you see yourself getting married in the future?
i desire someone sweet, kind, cute, stong, and loyal.
if you broke up with him, move on.
i prefer someone complimenting me on my attractiveness.
you have to wait until the evening.
how can i convince my man to reconsider?
if you are that stupid, proceed!
it is in third person.
she is my friend, but i am so attracted to her.
when you find him, make sure you don't ignore him.
if you aren't the talkative type, how do you get them to notice or talk to you?
i like it because it is a very exotic food.
don't contact her too much - it's all about balance!
women love to talk, so make more female friends.
i don't want to sound like i'm bragging, but i've been told that i'm a nice guy.
( only because i was an ex)
i suppose- it depends on how trustworthy you are.
well, i think i am attracted to men- so it is odd when girls ask me out.
i am a one-woman man.
i am married and i am too good for you!
someone he can speak with that is pretty, smart and funny.
depending on your age, you can try to socialize and make his company.
she actually granted me a favor.
i have noticed that you are tired.
i am thirty-five years old today, my parent are still friends.
i do not like long hair muscular men.
do not answer my calls.
those are the wrong girls you are looking at.
he makes her very happy, so i chose not to interfere.
there are a lot of things in the world.
you need to work on it.
if you truly love him, you will keep trying to inform him that you still have these feelings.
you are able to chat in both yahoo messenger and msn messenger.
i agree, people from puerto rico are very attractive.
perhaps i'm just old fashioned.
we have had no weddings thus far. i hope i am not disappointed by any that may come.
you should ignore people who try to tell you who you should be attracted to.
i do want them to like me, however.
because most men are labeled as 'dogs,' and they always shall be.
first, i would make some new friends.
i know you are thinking, "hello best friend," you don't want to interfere with that.
if you aren't getting any pleasure, then you have a personal problem.
i may be able to help you if you tell me how old you are.
what am i to do as her friend?
you mean your former best friend, correct?
she calls her husbands name while she is sleeping with you!
do you just go for the next man that comes along?
i mean, does this pertain to the length, the girth, or what?
because we are not always like that.
yet, what is most important is your feelings for one another.
a boyfriend is for real, and not for play.
however, if you can, then it is worth it.
here's hoping you find someone very similar.
you must move on. i know it's hard to realize right now but there are many other women that would be compatible with you.
in all honesty part of finding ones true love is partly based on luck.
she must realize that, although potential mates will come and go, true friendship will most likely last forever.
i happen to think this is an amazing thing.
move out. people are afraid of the homosexual, if you cannot get along then move out.
go ask jeeves, type in lap dance and check your results.
it may take you both some time.
he is settling down and wants to marry, are you ready?
if there is no love, then you're not a couple, you're just two individuals whom are fornicating.
that is also worse than losing her.
firstly, about men being the head of the household.
i stayed with him as he worked in fast food restaurants
she is not going to just walk up to your door and knock on it.
are you joking with me or are you being obtuse for a reason?
in the year of 1993, he was in the army at ft. hood 2nd ad.
send him a card or letter as all he can reply is negative.
absolutely not, madame, as you are quite attractive in that i would not mind having an opportunity to accompany you.
a true love implies loving unconditionally for what makes him jovial, also makes you jovial.
i had a lengthy list for my hsuband, and he only obtained two items for me, which is usual.
i do not mind waiting. however, i do not want someone creepy pushing something on me.
it is only his issue and not yours.
i do that action constantly.
if you have not found the correct female then i wish you the best of luck.
treat her like an equal human being.
i don't feel like trying any more.
keep your senses sharp because opportunity does not knock twice.
i would not be with him if he was a millionaire.
do you mean physically or mentally?
in my opinion it is better to fantasize than cheat anyway.
it is never about loving the other person.
don't you know nothing is for free, you always have to pay a price.
i bought hershey's kisses and taped them to one of the poems.
girls, what should i do?
i would go with the man i love.
i want to say, guys are the the only jerks when they are jealous.
i am so confused, help me here!
i agree with him, in my opinion.
it is hard to come up with a firm age.
it is very hard for a newcomer in ottawa, due to the shortage of girlfriends now.
also, don't go to bed if your angry.
okay,what guys really need is time apart. i mean apart!!!
i like two guys but they're best friends.
you need to be 18 to get married without your parents permission.
do people really talk that way?
even if it badly hurts, do not show it.
why not try talking? it can help you make friends.
then, i found out she was still married to one of the fathers of her children.
i would not do it, but i do not mind if my boyfriend does.
you need to let her go.
i am unsure, she likes him but is not in love with him.
men tend to keep their personal life a secret.
i am also having the same issue and am unsure of what to do.
if you enjoy her company.
size is not always important, make sure that you know how to treat her first.
you should try it if you haven't already.
try to sever ties and move on.
i wouldn't give someone another chance if they hurt me.
men tend to be more tidy than women.
i can not help you.
when i am trying, do not permit them, they begin to become mad, and believing that i do not favor them.
remember, simply perform slightly, do not execute entirely.
i finally was able to begin it.
excavate your nasal opening when you know that he is observing.
or, perhaps you intend too hard to coerce a woman into believing what you are saying.
we aren't kids anymore, and we don't need to act like it either.
he only wants to hook up.
guys like it when you are upfront.
will you let your spouse act like this?
he will get down on one knee.
because young men who get in trouble are more attractive and girls are drawn to them.
it all depends on what you communicate about with people.
i just attempted to be myself.
i don't like it; does it matter to you?
i'm not sure, but it seems to be that way.
that is why you cannot do it.
at age 25, you will have time to figure out who youi are and where you are going.
break up with the jerk already.
i only judge others by their actions and not their looks.
it will always be present in your heart.
we might disagree with you so much that it seems we may bite your head off.
it is your responsibility to yourself to date as many men as possible so you might find mr wright.
if i were in that situation, it would make me very angry.
i think you are overthinking the situation. perhaps he would like your honest opinion on the subject.
you could talk to him in person and ask him his reason for doing that.
you are required to be at ease with one another or the travels will not be smooth.
well, perhaps it's simply not his nature...however that doesn't mandate that it must be yours.
ew, you homosexual. you're same-sex attracted and in the future you shall travel to the underworld. phrase that pleasantly and affectionately.
had you been aware that you'd be relocating, however you developed extreme feelings for a person different than any you'd experienced previously.
you are required to display to her your entire nature.
you're attractive like everyone else with an internet icon.
a lot of adults probably did this when they were young.
try it, it is erotic and fun.
i hardly see him in school, usually he is at my brother's basketball games.
if she will not provide an honest answer, then she is probably not worth your love.
just tell him. say sorry, but you are not attracted to him.
you sound desperate. relax, and the women will come to you.
perhaps you are flirting at a bar, perhaps you work with her, whatever the situation may be.
choose the second man, since you have a better chance of starting a relationship with him.
my personal experiences can answer all your questions, my friend.
it's not bad to have a boyfriend who treats you well.
sum1 is nice, not superficial, wouldn't cheat, and is straightforward.
that is not very romantic.
which david are you talking about?
i am a big, beautiful woman who is looking for real love.
be friends first, untill you are over the hill and well protected.
go ahead and do it.
if she loves you, she will believe you.
find the right guy and take a chance on him.
everyday you should give the gift of love freely.
you have a nice name.
if you have feelings for her then asking her out is the perfect thing to do.
we have two kids and have been together for six years.
she has a nice body.
call me and i will let you know if you got it right.
just because things look one way, do not assume anything.
do not get caught. i can remember guys getting suspended for that reason.
it is clear that the answer is no.
shave and then indulge in the vagina for oral sex.
why do you think divorces are so expensive?
she is just waiting to get her revenge, i don't believe in do that.
i have never cheated on my boyfriend.
i don't want them to like me for my size, but for who i really am.
yes, david is gay - if you're talking about david beckham the football player.
i don't agree with tinkerbell up there.  you don't have to get a girl everything she wants.
hey, i like your dress!  did you see that movie?
try to let go of him.  a momma's boy never changes.
is the just one? what do you like about me?
you would eat your husband if he was a box of cheeze-its. do not lie.
say what you have to say, right to his face.
i think this really hurts.
i want to meet an honest guy that i actually like.
when one door closes god opens another.
i pray you do not have aid's.
we are going to a church picnic.
if he breaks up with the woman he's currently dating, be there for him then.
i'm not stuck doing the same old things, but i would help anyone in any way possible.
yes, at least one person (drew barrymore, to be specific).
if she can't understand that, you should start spending time with other friends.
a man who seems completely interested in me right away makes me uninterested in him.
there are a lot of gold diggers out there.
you think that you have chemistry with someone, but you really do not.
you should tell him, he might be waiting for you to come and say hi.
there is a ten year difference, do not worry.
how do i make the first move without ruining my chance to get someplace?
do not let butterflies interfere with this great time in your life!
i am wishing for something much longer.
they need to be warmed up.
find something you greatly enjoy doing and you will come close.
this is because they are under the impression they will not get caught going out with other people.
what if you had a male best friend?
so, if a former drug user like myself can stop, then so can he.
and you know what to do afterward...
if your avatar is any indication of how you look in person, then i find you sexually attractive!
well, just be yourself, not disingenuous.
when you bend over the side of his car for him.
there's a lot of weird people out there. especially males.
this particular love hangs its head in shame.
give him a moment to recalculate his normal life.
it's the same as asking anyone else out on a date.
i would do it and see where it leads, it could be a lot of fun!
a cut is much cleaner!
make yourself happy before anyone else!
they are not used to people treating them nice all the time.
of course they would want to leave you, they do not want children if they are not theirs!
i would appreciate total honesty from you, do you mean in a sense of a relationship or just casual sex?
you should phrase it as if you are giving her options without her even knowing you are really just pushing your agenda.
the old adage is true, being yourself is always the best and if it is meant to be, it will be.
that would be an enjoyable occasion for me as well as her girlfriend.
by your fourth date, you should have at least received a kiss.
ask your parents, they will tell you.
let it go; the rest is her responsibility.
i would just smile and say, "forget about it."
if he really likes you and you like him, then get together with that man.
give her gifts; something from the heart.
i hope that you find a good one.
what is the actual meaning of platonic?
it is not wrong at all.
is skinny plus fat mean real love?
let him know that you like him.
my boyfriend would become emotional if he knew that i just said that.
think about the consequences and actions because it is like stealing your best friend's happiness.
i cannot talk to her for some reason.
i do not know what to do because i like this guy.
it is like the old song "love and marriage" that says you cannot have one without the other.
you need help from a girlfriend.
if he still does not want to have children, then you will have to let this go.
the really attractive man is more than likely arrogant and selfish.
he sounds like he is not a very nice person.
true love is when a person can take you away from life as you know it.
if your friend was aware that you two had a previous relationship, that makes her look bad.
remember, you will never see her again, take the chance.
it is ok, a lot of my male friend are too shy to make the first move.
there is always a lingering dream to be "the rebels" partner.

i feel bad for her.
some women are just not comfortable with men seeing her privates in that way.
yes, if the sex is bad.
guys always like to be happy when girls are around.
life if too short to worry about small things!
well if the wife is wise only once, lol.
she shouldn't be cheating on you unless you are ugly.
but stay in touch regardless or you'll regret it!
what should i give her???
i'd never have the guts to do it because two would probably be my limit since i am a good girl.
the key is to remain calm and tell them what is on your mind.
i have spent time with him before.
you should take them to a movie.
maybe she is still in love with you and wants to take your relationship to the next level.
i want and need someone who cares about me and loves me.
everyone wants to spend time with people who are interesting and fun.
i do not do that, seriously. they need assistance. they most likely think you are attractive.
i do not know about life.
i have something i want to discuss with you.
it is possible she loves the other woman more than she loves you.
you should spend some time with her and then inform her.
no, that is not the right way.
it is based on your savings account or your total assets.
if she does not liek you, then you cannot make her.
you should try spending time with her in a group of friends first.
he does not have to open his mouth to talk.
make peace with him, but do the right thing.
you will know if it is true love.
let your heart decide which man you should choose.
please help me, i have no idea what i should do!
i know she is sexually active, and that the man is obnoxious.
also, his taste is very, very expensive.
otherwise, you know what to do.
you are dating the wrong type of guy.
i think that if i were you i would have gotten over him that minute.
don't do it while your mate is around.
guys don't call girls after that because they got what they wanted.
guys like a chase, but they don't want inferior, little dewy-eyed gals.
when you commit sexual acts then tell them the relationship is over, and afterwards spend time with their friends.
i am enjoying sleeping in my home, and she is occupying the same space with me!
however, by purposefully hiding this it becomes unfriendly!
well, you have many different type of people you converse with in many places.

you could have one of your obese male friends have a talk with him. he seem awfully weird.
think of yourself being with a female that you really love. i'm timing you.

you can buy jewelry or give money. i wouldn't recommend buying flowers, however.
this saying has been repeated throughout the ages, "men are no good, but women are just as despicable".
how can i discover if he is truly in love with me?
she has quite the commendable posterior; a commendable posterior and an alluring visage.
who cares if you are older?
you should not start yelling at her immediately.
men usually get defensive, if they are attacked.
stay vigilant to your committment.
i am 15 years old now and recently had sex 4 months ago.
stay calm, ladies.
i am a creative person.
i want my girlfriend to love me for who i am.
it should last only three hours.
do not rush it.
they will learn to love you.
if he doesn't, take a break from him.
i don't think of it like that, but i did it anyway.
the first thing you should do is talk to him and get to know him.
i can tell you from experience that it is both.
men all like different smells.
depending on the two people, i'd say sure.
if you drink enough tequila anyone will look like drew barrymore.
girls are actually disgusted by guys who are like that.
it depends, but why did you get divorced in the first place?
i am in love with one now.
just relax, you already have him so what's the rush?
yes, it will help you to decide whether or not you all are compatible.
my friend's boyfriend dumped her last week and she is recovering from a breakup
ask his boyfriend, he will know.
well, he did break up with you.
if you boyfriend is good to you, stay with him and tell other guys to leave you alone.
so they just act normally while lying to you consistently about the other person.
cry and go on, beg them or threaten to kill yourself, or just accept it.
if you like this person more than that, then i would not.

if you ignore him for long enough he will go away.
we women have feelings, you know.
why do you see him every day?
take the time to get to know the girl before you decide to leap.
it is clear that he is not lazy.
do things slowly so that you can see how things went wrong.
i would make a handmade card for mom and dad and then kill time on yahoo answers.
she is very unreliable, so don't ask her.

maybe your friend will lend it to you.

whether drunk or not, no means no.
no call after a date?
we chat every now and again.
gregor is said to be better, but i do not like it.

why are you guys like that?
i enjoy how you spell out words.
you should either ask her out on a date or you should flirt with her a lot more. i would find another person to be infatuated with.
there is nothing wrong with browsing. i wish you luck.
you should only do what you've mentioned if you find it acceptable that your best friend might violently retaliate when he discovers what you have done.
you should forget about them, as well, and get some new friends who will be more faithful.
i have thought about sex at least sixty times in the past two hours.
he may be too tired and happy to care.

make him dinner and tell him that he owes you.
i am telling you that he was huge.

men always love preppy women, try out for the cheerleading squad.
you may need to change what you do not like.
then you have to be nice and show a special interest in her.
i think it depends on what a man really wants.
love is inside you. it is all about trust; that is, the commitment you have to make to one person.
if you truly care for him, tell him.
do not let him get away with it.
it used to be, but things have changed now.
but not all people are like that.
give palmela and her five sisters a phone call.
wear some sexy undergarments and give him oral sex.

yes, that is my mother.

well, you know that many of my family and friends will be getting married soon.
if you prefer this one, then you must have a conversation.
what would you suggest is the best approach?
do not complain to her about nonsense.
you can read some men's fashion magazines for ideas.
if she gets another man, you will be out of the picture.
some friends are getting married close.

if it were for another female then the answer is no.
some of the questions were jokes but the ones with the asterisk were for a potential mate.
popular people have too many problems and they tend to abandon people frequently.
this is guy is obviously not "the one" in any case so your experience will be disappointing.
i regret to inform you that not all men are disloyal.
i sincerely hope that you can repair things, or proceed with your life if you are not able to.

the women you are dealing with might not want relationships.
i told my ex, he said he was happy for me.
no because i am a male.
was it a female with one blue eye and one green eye and had blonde colored hair?
start a conversation with her, and you can see where it goes from there.
because i have a hard time finding love and because i am over weight, please advise me.
i was young but it happened with a boy i married 3 years later, i was 13 years old.
repeat that to her and be truthful.
the word is flirt.

with god you can not loose.
it enhances your sexual appeal.
if you have feelings for her, do not force things.
are you single or involved with someone?
ask a friend of yours to relay a message for you.
there is nothing wrong with being friends.
i suppose what i wonder then is why so many men behave so badly?
what kind of woman wants to date a man who is afraid to protect her?
lately my dreams have been very depressing.
wait and see if he will take steps to advance the situation.

cheer up and i wish you the best!
be abstinate until marriage.
do not do it again the following day.
end your relationship with the other two girls and also apologize to them.
try your luck with one of the two men, and if he accepts your offer then that is great, but if he doesn't then try with the second man.

i love my wife very much, but whenever i think about sex with her, i feel full of dread.
when you get in the pants of a female.
so, have you not decided who to stalk yet?
you should go with the man whom you like.
i do not mean to be rude, but i do not see what the trouble is.
become a man that a respectable woman would be searching for.
many girls are a lot like guys and just in it for the sex.
do not lead another person on.
i guess, all girls do like hearing it.
pick one that you like and stick with it.
you know you are from the south when you meet your date at a family reunion.
you should keep speaking.
that is interesting, we did not talk long. i am going to get back to talking and then i will let you know.

she will say either yes or no. then you will have an answer, and not have to worry anymore.
i am a girl, so trust what i have to say.
you should make him a nice romantic dinner.
he doesn't deal with his anger well.
i'm afraid there isn't much you can do.
always be sure that peoples intentions are good.
listening to her will show her you aren't like every other guy she has dated.
if you ask married people if they can flirt with each other, yes.
pretend you aren't aware, and things like that.
whatever she did to you was clearly not bad enough.
it was for me as well, so if you get slightly disappointed you should know the reason.
what is the worth thing that can happen?
you need to learn 4 words, oh yes.
why would stay and allow her to continue to have an affair?
do they make a good couple?
i am 23 years old and he is 43 years old, he has yet to have a girlfriend until now.
i always believed ciara was a man?
2 years of being together is normal in a relationship.
this is a strictly a family program.

someone will get hurt.
as far as your so-called best friend is concerned...
he told me that she used to like me.
this is okay sometimes but not all the time.
he has been very distraught about it.
i am afraid that if you want a girl who is good you will have to wait.
if both of you want it then there is no reason for you to feel guilty.
in the girl's opinion it really does not matter.
am i requesting too much?
he wants her to quickly fall in love with him.
get to know her first before becoming her boyfriend.
always be honest about what kind of relationship you want.
beauty is considered first, followed by physique. large breast make a good impression  if you would like to be attractive to men.
we have never been in any fights or anything similar.
you need to find better uses for your time.
it means to love women and most men love women, hence all men are lesbians.
eyes, then shoulders, then the lower body.
most have kids already and may not want more.
i think you were just with the wrong boyfriends.
if he or she was really bad in bed.
if so, be very careful not to get their hopes back up if things won't work out again.
if you don't talk to the girl you will not date her.
i have always loved that type of thing as well.
it is the same reason why some people dislike homosexuals.
that is what jaycee did to me.
one can find many men who will engage in intimate relationships with larger women.
there may be a problem with an individual if that person is unable to foster friendships.
i will pick it up as soon as possible.
if you can not wait, fuck somebody on the side until you are married.
guys are very easy to figure out.
girls, also, like it when their men remove or trim their body hair for cosmetic effect.
it probably depends on where they go to meet guys.
surely you already know what the right thing to do is. if you did not you would not be asking me this question.
they ended up getting married and at some point she left her husband for another man.
if you're leaning towards a 'yes' then you should really consider why that is.
your only real option is to be strong and try to move forward with your life.
how old are you, if i may ask?
they are being treated in bad manner too often and they don't like it.
please stop fretting about your former love.
how rude of me, i'm sorry to have said that.
if we get a divorce our kids will be alright.
if your girlfriend cheated on you with another female would you stay with her?
we have to realize that guys are not exactly deep.
it depends on if you both like eachother.
18 years old is too young, because you are still finding yourself.
here is some new advice- go without.
remember, it is about you and what you want.
get her red roses so you show her that you are in love.
then when you are done dry her and let her finish her hair.
first of all, only say it once.
do not try to pretend to like the things he likes.  if you do, that is cool.
a 50 year old woman is not an old woman; she is young.
personally, it helped me for making the worst mistake of my life.
first of all, she isn't your best friend, because she treats you terribly.
it isn't something i depend on.
the only time i touch myself is when someone watches.
he had a 7 1/2 long reason that stays on my mind.
i'm curious if anyone knows that i'm here.
that do not result in pregnancy.
i employ all of the shortcuts that i know.
yes, it takes a lot of consideration for a man to ask, and you are interrupting the long process.
if you think you're mature enough, then try it!
flirting together is wonderful.
of course i would, but i am married.
a man's finances are not my concern.
if you choose one man, than socialize less with the other.
oh everyone should not wear shoes.
ask her as well if she doesn't mind you watching while she slept.
i approve with maria's answer.
and he is upset about that as well.
maybe you should learn to type and formulate proper sentences first.
things are going great now.  i have been asked out around 30,000 times here in yahoo answers.
you have got to be kidding!
girls with blue eyes and blonde hair.
give her a call if the both of you are available!
in my opinion, the only thing that counts is if you love each other. do not worry; be happy!
alas, we have never initiated such a discussion, and i desire to have a conversation with her.
i could continue as my male paramour is incredible.
they cannot admit it, however, and usually retain their image by replying with disgusted remarks.
some males also find it disheartening for the lady to ask them to a romantic encounter.
allow sufficient time, you shall know.
if those women don't trust you, you shouldn't trust them.
nothing is wrong with that.
two weeks later, he says he loves me too.
i swore this guy hadn't had a girlfriend for the duration of high school.
that question is the most hilarious i've ever heard.
i'd like to add that if you do not enjoy his company, then that is something that will likely not change.
remember, men love a challenge, not someone who chases them.
if he is afraid of commitment at the moment, give him time to overcome his fear.
he had an issue involving his friend who was injured.
do you believe it is possible that you can married and still have money remaining afterwards?
there is no way right way until you ask him if he likes you.
i would not do it myself, but i think it is ok.
that is not how real love works.
what about it being uncut?
that is not correct, this is yahoo answers so keep trying.

no one know what they are doing.
nice guys do not just "hang out".
young lady, you have a classic problem that is as old as man kind.

tell the person your feelings and inform them that you do not like this.
now, he has been my boyfriend for 1 year and 3 months.
i am sure that you have been in a relationship with other men similar to you that you did not enjoy.

i do not know, i just want to know why they are so jealous?
tell her boyfriend that she cheating is cheating on him because it is the right thing to do.
yes it is okay as long as you are going to have sex with her and not someone else.
she enjoys her work and i am happy with what i am doing.
no, i only look like myself.
prince william and my boyfriend are tied.
rushing into something at his young age was not a wise decision.
what works for me is listening and then responding.
tell her that you like her.
all one can do is tell her that you love her and that you will always.
do you care for her emotional side?
perhaps she would like to repeat it.

i have been wondering what the bases represent.
the "guy thing" is still true.
are you sure about that now?
please say "hello" to her.
it would be for the best to just accept it and move on.
i apologize, but i am not much of a writer.
the boys are both 27 years old now and they are the best of friends.
none of those were worth staying with, but if i answer honestly, the answer is that i do.
it is my thought that you should be.
we kissed on the first day.
i have already done it and it works.
they are no longer on drugs and are doing better.
i will fornicate with my boyfriend.
i was so shocked that i did not reply
two and a half years of dating and we are now married.

make your lips more soft to display a sense of romance, not just passion.
that you have to obtain a marriage license to be married.
so please offer up to me what i should do?
cologne, or friendship bracelets, or ring for the two of you.
whoever love that loved not at first glance.
you should stay with them through all the rough times.
the walk will tell it all.
at least then you will know and can move on.
they usually use emotion before thinking.
you honestly have to ask yourself, could you put up with having a boyfriend that is flirtatious.
if he is cute, funny, and nice i would love him!
when i make that statement, it's meaning is precise.
it would not seem possible hat you could acquire an infection.
i suggest you go to a place you enjoy and strike up a conversation about the hobby.
in the event that you need to ask, it means you are too young and should wait.
all i am recommending is that you be suspicious of him.
forward these three wishes of grace, mercy, and peace.
roses, dinner, affection, and long conversations.
move on to see other partners.
be a person who cares and helps people.
gay men are not interested in women.
you don't mean much to him.
we don't do it, we have it. it's natural so you don't need to fight the urges.

wait until you realize that you're ready.
let me ask you this, do you remember the day you were married? how did he respond?
hold onto it, you cannot get it back once it's gone.
love brings us pain because we do not understand.
if you fancy them, keep them.
they see you and talk to you quite a bit.
you will survive, do not be concerned.
i am married, and i would kill my husband if he did that!
i would want some aphrodisiacs in that basket.
be yourself, don't try to join a group. separate yourself from everyone else.
because they are making it up to make you feel good.
it's with because he has sexual problems or little to no experience with sexual activities, or he is not a man.
i asked him if he still loved me and he responded with yes, but didn't act the same.
do you have any idea what you're father in law wanted to talk about?
you continue to be who you are and she will notice you eventually.
does it change or feel different when you are having coitus?
in my opinion, it shows that they are attempting to know me better.
do not become disheartened.
love would not hurt if you did not care.
it depends on how much they want to enjoy themselves.
it did not end up working out, although he did understand what i was trying to convey!
then what exactly is the problem?
well, i do live in utah, so that must count for something.
any amount of searching will be fruitless.
are you serious?
it is because you gave him what he wanted.
then you should let her know how you feel.
a girlfriend once told me that i was a bad kisser.
you are too young to be wasting your time on this guy.
he does not know how you will react, or he is too shy.
if people are willing to help, don't let them.
that as well as a low sex drive may make him not happy.
i wouldn't advice it, whatever happened once before can happen again.
go find someone different.
why do your friends not like him?
he just turned you on.
do sweet things that matter to him and now you.  the rest will fall into place.
there are men out there that will care about you more than he does, if he likes another girl more than you.
when love hits, all pain leaves in that moment and you are invincible.
i am completely in love withe victoria's secrets dream angel heavenly.
one negative influence is tainting the entire group.
although he is in a relationship with another woman, he does not love or want her like he does me.
the result will be negative.
when you're married you can still remain attractive to your partner.
there are those who have charisma, and those who do not.
you can never tell unless something big occurs.  if they support you, yes.  if not, then no.
if it still holds his interest then, then it's an entirely different matter.
is it wise to date somebody who has a bi-polar disorder?
they have yet to find you!
it would be best to not choose any of them!
does he take medication regularly?
try to talk to them separately.
not all men are going to take a woman back if she leaves them.
things will fall apart if you don't care.
this should be a song.
you do not want to in any case.
i love my former girlfriend very much.
a man desires it but does not know how to keep it.
however, in actuality, i do not know what i find attractive about it.
focus more on who you are and what you like and all will work out for the best.
when you are older you will meet the one, and get serious.
yes, some of them are but the ones i like are funny because some of them act much more feminine.
they did not like me because of how i look.
look at the following question: do women like sex as much as men do? i wonder.
are you looking for love or just an attractive partner? a man does not have to be handsome to be able to love.
if you have an exclusive relationship with your new boyfriend, remember that your old relationship ended for a reason.
do not give up, quitters never win!
boys will come and go but friendship is forever.
no, you will just end up being extremely horny.
i suggest that you make an arrangement to meet with him. if he shows up, you will know that he is interested in you.
being popular is not necessary.
unfortunately, some men are still like that in college.
cheers to the men who should know about this.
if you will pay for the airfare, i would be willing to try it.
she will love it if you use your tongue on both the front and back.
what can i do to prevent him from spending so much money?
i am not sure what to say.
they love it when we listen to them.
what if i tell him i'm attracted to him, and he teases me because he doesn't like me?
it isn't bad, it is horrible. but follow your heart.
i think the man is gay.
however, we never share it with each other.
i am uncertain whether this will help.
what was the first time you to had sex like?
i am uncertain regarding what i should do, i find him extremely annoying but i love him.
i am happy to hear that you are taking care of your mother.
do not conclude that he is ignoring you just because he hasn't called.
i can guess it is because i am the cuter looking one.
why is it that women are always trying to get their hands on a mans hard earned money?
he called from work and said he would be home late, then came home drunk at 3am.
i do not think there is a cure for a broken heart.
to answer the first question, of course she will get jealous. but, you need to know if that girl likes you or not.
you must decide if it is worth fighting for.
relax and let him go if he so chooses.
if you're honest with yourself while reading this book, you will learn you're not productive.
you cannot change someone, even though loved,  they have to change for themselves.
i'm not a man, but i do believe you should be yourself.
i apologize girl, you deserve to have tons of enjoyment.
hmm, wow, that's a great one!
let him be content with his decision.
i want to live, why did he get away with his life and i'm still trapped, please help me.
not bisexual, but really enjoyed all i've had.
because men are always unskilled at  expressing their emotions and women are sensitive and easily wounded.
consider how you would hurt your wife and child.
additionally, i said that i would pay.
the reason is that you still love your former partner.
then you can be wed and have sex.
you need an attorney.
twenty years old is acceptable.
i have awesome church friends.
i wish you both blessings!
i advise you to seek a good lawyer immediately.
under 20 is preferable it would appear.
i have great friends that are emo.
the prevalence of finding it easier to give up  is because they think 'boy' in their minds.
may you both have good-luck beset upon you.
to meet new people, you should open yourself up to new experiences.
i am having a lunch date with a woman i like.
my boyfriend isn't in love with me, so i can't help you.
in school, it is normal for people to tease you.
after that happened, he tickled me. i asked him to stop because my back hurt.
ok, you do not have to wait that long.
the best advice i have is to, leave.
he is not going to respect you in that relationship.
they do not think it is costly to move out.
although, it is ok to cry.
i do not have an idea of what to do when we spend time together.
only he knows the reason.
some people do not attract me at all.
oral sex does not guarantee a relationship.
it is only hard when you are young.
why? just talk to each other, and whatever you do, do not say, ever since you had the baby.
i mean, have vigorous sex with her.
being female, i am not sure if the same structures are in place.
i finally left him, and that is the best thing i could have done.
if he says yes, then suggest that it would be fun to see it on friday after school.
most of the time guys are trying to imress a girl, and to get her to like him.
i would not, that is what a real woman would do.
i have always said that if she does small things for you...
do it when the time feels right.
i would be riding in my porche, then date beyonce.
look for the positive in your own life.
enjoy and good luck! regards, satya
i imagine they empty it more often after that.
do not make it too formal or he might get scared.
yes, your best friend can be your boyfriend as well but if the relationship ends then you lose both.
many attractive men desire sex rather than love.
that is fine. one cannot fabricate a girlfriend.
that is to say, it is most likely not acceptable.
i always hear people say, "do not do it, your children will be unhappy."
i greatly appreciate you giving me two points!
i would like to know why this excites you so much.
always afraid of doing something wrong.
i'm sure he will refrain from doing that again.
your words were, "if two girls...", based on your wording, i assume you are rather young.
from my own experience dealing with them, you need to leave.
i calls and only wants to have sex.
you're too young, this will not affect your health.
there are many different ways to see life.
ask whether she would consider a third partner.
give it some time and effort, but don't push it.
they aren't always satanic, they are just evil.
before we kissed, he would always try to make a move.
if you try to turn left he will correct you.
there is a process with having sex that starts with kissing and ending with intercourse.
sorry madam i have missed your name. please stop searching for love because you have already found me.
is she rich because she owns a bar?
the man you will be with will find you one day.
at a restaurant table.
i don't think they do, that is why i am asking.
i need a girl to help me please!
you are a confusing person, what is you gender?
chocolate, roses, handcuffs, and edible underwear.
i think i am a decent man, are you a decent girl?
because they are having relations with men that they do not like.
just avoid him, be kind, it will make him angry and make you look like the better person.
perhaps suggest a weekend getaway and have a relative or friend keep an eye on the children.
an ear needs to be extemely clean or the taste is very horrible-disgusting!
he didn't appreciate you for being a loving and caring person. so, hell with him. move on.
you don't want seconds, do you?
why did you make out with him and give him head?
hello. i am a 21 year old boy.
he loves nice things, yet he doesn't like to spend money.
so if he likes you he will either say "cool" or he will ignore you and leave.
why did you marry the woman if you did not truly love her?
then again, i drive a well worn truck as well.
however, do not be afraid to find out!
well that depends on how you feel about her.
you should show them that you care about what they say.
an occasional smoker will lie about that too.
i definitely would, why do you ask?
i can not believe that you would try to take off her dress.
please tell him not to take it personally.
it sounds like she did you a favor.
pull him toward you so that he knows to get on top.
stay at the house, drink, and talk about what men have done wrong now.
she is now telling me she has no other way to deal with it.
yes, it actually depends on how you are feeling.
his lost, that how you need to see it.
hit your genitals with a hammer.
just say "hey, wanna go get a drink, movie, or something"?
whatever you do, do not rant with him!
i am saving myself for marriage, you're silly, but you receive your answer.
the fun and fornicating won't last forever, however true love will.
this news pains me.
i fancy him and he is nice.
evidently he does not desire you if you're cheating.
do not let it bother you.
the kids have to be protected.
keep your man encouraged with lots of love and bible.
you should send a poem/card or just say it flat-out.
no, i would not take heed in regards to it.
placing the kids' safety above everything else is paramount, wouldn't you agree?
support and encourage your man in taking chances (with ease).
once virginity is lost, it cannot be re-obtained.
men have just as much problems with communication as do women.
how do i know that you aren't a serial killer?
they can all just go away.
i find it funny that i am in a relationship with my brother's best friend.
it will be awkward.
that guy is too nervous to talk to that girl.
i need to get to know you better.
who cares what they think.
it is not funny that she is going out with her brothers best friend.
this fellow had a head full of hair in this photograph.
unattractive-disgusting-revolting, some people feel like it is a form of art.
older so he would keep me safe and be comfortable with sexual intercourse...
please tell them to wait for a few moments.
you do not set the list, stupid slave, she does!
i will read your question, if you answer mine.
i will keep small, not a lot.
the right size does matter.
do not lose control of your health.
this will have less of an affect than living in a house with constant fighting.
it would not be love if it did not hurt.
you should flirt with her, but be calm and be friends with her before asking her out.
they are shallow if they don't find sincerity in your truthfulness.
legally he has the right to collect his belongings in the presence of a police officer.
also, she is not doing her job.
if you feel comfortable, just tell her.
ask her and if she says no, just remember that you are a great guy and it is her loss.
his name is chad and it is said that he currently likes me, but i am not sure of that so please help me.
what do you mean when you say "act right"?
if he has an issue with that, you should end the relationship.
i want to take our friendship into a relationship.
i am a male that has been rejected for my size.
it is difficult financially, but she is doing good.
she is avoiding you, she may have feelings for another man.
it is not surprising that i have not married.
this last week, he visited me on my boss's day off, as usual.
my husband and i met on q106 rock and roll date line.
i have been thinking about you all night.
it is difficult now, but you will be fine in the long run.
there are not too many normal women who would like that kind of thing.
he loves you but he wants to sample others, too.
i just want our love to stay fresh while i am gone.
if this is the first baby, he is probably just frightned and jealous about all the attention you get.
don't put your spouse through this.
does anyone want to give advice on getting over a breakup?
hey, half the fun of having a child is the trying part!
i'm thirty and never been involved in sexual activity!
i have not idea, i haven't seen any genitals but my own.
i do apologize, but no, it is not time yet, please do not do it at this time!
i do not understand how ethnicity is a good match, so that is going to be a huge no...
just flirt with her and be yourself.
men also like women who can spell correctly, because we surely cannot.
twenty one is a very younge age to be married.
also, i am a married woman.
do not do what you do not want to do just to be nice to him.
would you want to check it out?
it is in their nature to be that way.
i insisted to her that she wear her best dress.
you shouldn't do anything that you might regret afterwards.
nothing i say. young lady, you better mind your own business.
but after you cheat for the first time, you are forever a cheater.
find yourself some work, and somewhere else to live.
it would be awkard within the 11-12 age range.
a male should have a plan before pursuing tasks.
do you keep your sexual orientation public or private?
in my opinion, i am a single, normal person.
my male counterpart gets jealous if i socialize with my male friends.
perhaps he is simple no longer interested in you.
we just do not spread that information around.
oh my goodness, people are having intercourse at the age of 14!
if you sleep with this guy i can guarantee he will end the relationship shortly after.
i am twenty-one years old and i cried.
hello, where are you moving to and what is your age?
in my opinion, many women are attracted to men with piercings and tattoos, why is that?
you are the only one who can make that decision, just be careful.
how can you be sure that he has good intentions?
you should ask her if she would like to pursue an intimate relationship with you.
most of the time.
just remove yourself from the situation and move on with your life.
i think you should get used to that type of behavior.
i'm not certain how he feels.
remember that you got married for better or for worse.
get help (especially from him) if you cannot do this yourself.
one reason is that he may be very nice or mean so look for his phone number and follow him.
and they send those photos.
try to talk about the things that are really bothering him.
will you go out with me, that is the question?
only when my wife is not around, do i stare at other females.
my email is "i'm_god_2_women.heaven.ord, or you can call me at 777-adore-me.
i agree with the person above me.
he justs wants to get to sleep with him, don't tell him what color your panties are.
i feel jealous when she does not have any value for me.
two straight guys, now that is another story.
yes, they are the best match.
i think pakistan will get better and better in the future.
come on, if that does not work, go get plastic surgery, botox, a horrible dark tan, and then maybe a lamborghini.
you need to be willing to take the next step.
is it possible to lose my virginity without having sex?
a question for the women, do you find gay men attractive?
he got what he had been asking for.
i would be happy if you would share with me. i would like to stimulate your clitoris.
it is easiest to simply tell the truth.
if you cannot endure the situation, then it would be best for you to move.
they simply may not want to have a conversation with you.
marriage is a commitment, involving mutual concessions and compromises.
best friends always make the best relationships.
women are looking for their mr. right, and are quick to say that you are him.
other than at a radio sponsered event.
of course, men cry; it is natural.
but, it will get better soon.
there are a lot of things i want to do, but cannot, because she is there; what do i do?
eat her. trust me it always works.
there is no way to tell how hard that will hit you until it is too late.
so i say you should chose sides.
it will driver her insane. seriously, she will go crazy for your body after a good licking.
yes but you already know that, do you not?
i don't believe you want just a normal guy.
a lot of people dislike me because of it.
some like to have a nice man that does nice things for them.
i am 21 and have a child.
provided you are dating age.
sexual intercourse can lead to both pregancies and sexually transmitted diseases.  (you can take things into your own hands anyway.)
then take care of her like you always have.
they are more fiesty than ladies who do not go to church services.
i am eighteen and i will be the first to admit that i do not know what love is.
i have friends and they tell me that they love me, but they do not show it; should i trust them?
see if you can starting being with groups of friends.
from that, do not do it as you are risking contracting a disease.
tell him to stop going out with his other girl, or i will move on myself.
if you want more advice, email me: meow994

half of the individuals will be gay so you should pick and choose your companions appropriately.
getting a small car that gets good gas milage is the best answer.
you feeling alone isn't the reason you should miss him.
just because he doesn't always answer his phone doesn't mean he is cheating.
which girl it is, is what it depends on.
pretend it doesn't bother you, even if she says no.
why wouldn't we all be gay and merry?!
stuff like this is always so nice!
you can invite 8ver a few of your friends!
you should try to be just be yourself and hang out with him if you want to go out wth him.
congrats, you made it through your growth spurt without all the negativities it comes with!
my advice is to always use the restroom before and after sex.
you never know how something will turn out unless you give it a try.
i can't tell you what to do to make him care about you.
your reason for missing him should be because you like being with him.
millions of people have the same question.
i experienced the same thing last year.
do not involve yourself with him.
she is a seventeen year old girl from india.
young girls should not date guys that are old enough to be their father.
you have the same problem i did a year ago.
forget him and never do anything like that again.
as we get older we start to care less.
i am seventeen year old indian girl who wants to be a geologist.
i have had pen pals in the past, and they have been fun.
allow the man to invite you on a date.
why sit around and ponder, just do it!
perhaps after one year he will finally understand that you don't want to date him.
if you have a considerable amount of money, consult with a wedding planner for other ideas.
it appears this person is being deceitful with both of you.
endless supplies of love.
younger men have a preference for older women due to the possibility of obtaining sexual intimacy with them.
i have a deep respect for this man.
i simply do not know what to do.
the fact that i do not have to wonder about yours is good enough.
yes if it was intentional, not if it was an accident.
you can't hit a girl, so you can't fight back.
what is the worst thing that could happen? he says no? be confident.
you set yourself up by performing oral with no commitment beforehand.
i liked both women and men.
i think they it was on an episode of the brady bunch.
listen, and talk about his interests as well.
have you ever heard the saying, "he who find a good wife, has a good life"?
they want to have sex.
true love doesn't have a time limit.
explain to her that it is okay to tell you what she needs in order to be prepared. she is missing out.
are you the strange one or not?
try to find a good woman.
still, he said it did not matter.
simply do the wrong thing and make jokes with them about it.
this is a good thing, not a problem!
when you're together do you feel her? does she feel you?
do not take part in it.
i don't mind if a guy comes up to talk to me.
tell him goodbye now and forget him! a bad boy is no good for you!
make them required to aceept the person you are.
if he loves you it should be simple correct?
nine years is quite a long period of time.
he acts like he has feelings towards me.
he would perceive such if he were not.
if anyone is being flirtatious, then i agree.
traferse to a gentlemen's club and procure a promiscuous individual.
a bit unique, but not weird.
you more than likely will not until you encounter him in person.
he is grabbing all the stuff he can like a casanova or player.  what a jerk!
i want him back, but i do not know what to do.
i like to go perfume shopping with my man.
i know it sounds hard to do at school, but it really is the best thing to do.
maybe, it is a self-esteem issue.  they think they are better off sticking with the thug types.
the love you are feeling is inhibiting your thought process.
he wants t do it.
classic men are more my type than thugs.
please don't ask that type of question.
rub her shoulders then ask her to lie down so you may massage her back.
stay positive! good luck!
would you want to have a romantic relationship with him?
i was upset and cried.
i understand how you feel.
if the only way to escape is to abandon everything then you should do it.
in the past, i locked the bathroom door.
it is not possible to be certain; simply use caution.
you should consider if you will still want it once you have it.
i would be feel compelled to inquire as to why she is in plano, texas.
i still like my ex, but she disliked
do not anwer if the guy/girl only calls to have sex with you.
what do you have to be afraid for, he is human, just like you.
both of you are so nice!
as long as she does not find out.
i am 13, so i am a little young for you.
always keep your messages cleared, and don't let them meet in the same place.
what did you expect would happen?
your spelling is awful, i can tell that this is some sort of high school love.
do you think he is trying to fool me?
all women have one thing in common, they want romance.
we really aren't a frightening group.
let me share with you how things look from the eyes of a child.
that has quite a lot to do with it.
i suppose it would depend on the children.
if it isn't possible, i understand.
you are not yet the woman you will become.
i feel this survival topic is taken out too much out of context these days.
he can't help his feelings.
he only talked to her once, i don't know if i believe it.
for all you know, she has been wanting to ask you on a date.
when you go, there will be many chapel owners outside trying to get your business.
if he does not notice you, then it is because he does not fit well with you.
but do not have coitus with men on the first day.
choose the flying spaghetti monster.
after awhile do i want someone new?
watch the rat patrol, and you've got a squad.
call him when he says to call him.
there are plenty of chatrooms you can go on.
maybe he does or wanted your number!
girls do it all the time.
say i have found someone else!
we had a great time in vegas!
you need to tell her that he is being affectionate with you, and reject his attempts.
you want them to be happy together.
we are now just good friends.
you have to accept that he may like her instead of you.
the man who posted above me is hilarious!
if you love her, you should ask her if she loves you in return.
i was erect, just as i always when my wife is here.
be self-assured, and be yourself.
it is you that is creating for yourself a lonely life.
women are insecure and are in need at all times.
best thing to do is just say "hello" and mention your name.
loose him before he dumps you!
no, he is far too mature, and besides, he does not love you, he is only interested in your body.
features such as a good shape, complextion, color of the eyes and more things like that.
he enjoys nice things, but he like to save his money.
wait and see if you are able to repair your relationship.
having a baby can be a very stressful and tiring time.
i believe that family is forever.
that looks as good as a basket full of goodies.
refrain from watching it for 6 months and then try it again.
naughty in the bedroom, nice in the streets.
let her order something nice if she wants to.
do you perhaps like this person?
men come a dime in a dozen, but friendships are hard to maintain.
it isn't that he doesn't love you or wants to be with you.
let her go because she never likes, and she fools both of you.
that is because some women want to fall in love, especially with handsome people.
additionally, i absolutely do not want that particular physical trait to grow on me.
it is what my former girlfriend always uses and it always works!
how can i put my mind in control of me?
i am 15 years old and i enjoy going to the cinema with young men.
she may not be there, she may have left behind a false clue.
in need of your support and understanding at this time.
if you agree with that idea, than it is your choosing, i don't agree however, good luck.
well if he treats you well, then i think it is okay.
if you answer the questions with positive answers, there is a change you are in love.
i made something of myself.
if you want to end up with an old lady, or fat man.
i a man really likes you, you will know.
i read an email he sent to a woman, talking about love.
maybe send out clues to him letting him know you really want to kiss him.
they feel something and don't have any idea what it could be.
only the one you stumble upon in vampire bars and covens.
depends on who is with me.
that way, you are not completely breaking contact with her.
furthermore, ensure that you do not flirt a lot.
most of the time, i am simply nervous that the woman dislikes me, and this is all my own conjecture.
when you invite problems, you will have problems.
you will not receive any once the baby arrives.
how can you actually love your significant other?
what's more important to you? dating your friend's previous significant other, or remaining friends with her?
he wouldn't hold back no matter how much pain he put me through.
i typically use statements like "i desire to make love with you."
maybe i'm just not very good at being a boyfriend.
you should be more concerned about not being homosexual.
if you are married, then no.
if he is not interested in you, just give up.
well that depends on what you mean by "look".
flatter her frequently because that is a weak point for all women.
havinf fun after you cover it up isn't a good idea.
just hanging out doesn't have to seem like a date.
i plan on going see one.
have your parents sign the document to emancipate you or wait until you turn eighteen.
talking or flirting with other guys will make him jealous.
are you trying to select which guy to be with when your husband gets deployed?
i worked hard for the equal rights amendment and i was asked such as ignorant question.
my dad says they do not have any; is it a secret?
i suggest you go back to women who are down to earth.
i would like to hear your side of the story.
it won't work unless there is trust.
my ideal date would be a picnic at the beach or at the park with a store bought meal.
it is not okay.
you shouldn't feel alone.
sometimes things come together, sometimes they do not, but that is life.
have you ever considered that perhaps you both are not well for each other?
should i just stop thinking of them?
perhaps they don't want to lose you?
if you meant to date, than yes.
it is a homework assignment that must be finished tomorrow.
no, it is not strange. i did not date anyone until i was 19 years old and in college. now i am 22.
the problem is that i am unable to tell whether men enjoy it or not.
it has been very good for them.
every time you notice each other, smile.
you ask her to marry you.
so it will not matter what you say, they will not be interested.
lately all i have wanted to do is to sleep.
i guess it is not a question.
you have a real winner.
you need to love yourself and be creative.
you should ask him if he would like to get together some time.
there is no correct way to do it.
she may feel the same way you do.
that is how it is in california.
you have to be patient and wait for them to get here.
bro- get back on that bike.
in her heart- she really does want you to pay.
you would think we were sleeping if we didnt scream!
in the long run, you will be glad you did.
how should i inform my ex that i am no longer interested in him?
hi. how's it going? what are you looking for?
he does not love you. he loves having control over you.
when he behaves the way he was.
in my opinion, you should dump him if he is only interested in intercourse.
whatever you decide, do not call him every five minutes or several times in one day.
what is it that women like about men?
the greatest of them all is love.
if not, then he is self-centered..get out of there..you are headed for danger!
i get the feeling that what you desire is someone to tell you exactly what to do.
how about grab your mistresses' butt day.
there is this guy at my school, and i cannot tell if he likes me or even notices me.
cut your loses, i hate to say it but, he likes another girl.
not sure it would work, but you could try it.
to improve your sex life with your wife, please add some salt and pepper to her vagina, enjoy.
yes, they usally have to give it up.
thank you; always remain yourself!
now he might try to get in bed with you.
moving on, to the sex aspect.
i know how you are feeling; the same thing is happening to me.
let them know that you want a little freedom.
instead of fighting, ask him to rub your feet
show him it is no big deal even if it is.
use the internet if you have to.
ir is according to your age too, so if you are 35 you have a problem.
i like this guy and i believe he also likes me.
if he promised something and did not dfollow through, don't keep asking about the promise.
what is your opinion on "one night stands?"
if you are walking i recommend walking so vigorously that your hips break.
i realize that it is easier said than done.
certainly do what you feel is right.
if they only call you later times at night.
be firm when he doesn't stop and tell him no!
you said this is your very best friend.
sorry to answer your question with another question.
just mastebate a lot like i do!!
there are men out there that think you are a gem.
he was killed on the battlefield.
she means quite a lot to your family and we love and care for her and the boys very much.
any older than that may lead to trouble.
yes, that is true but there will be hate.
i am twelve. do you think that i have a chance?
i do love someone that can just have a good time!
if you desire it, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it..
i met him a couple of years ago during a friend's social gathering!
no, it just isn't alright, why can you not find someone more suited?
so, my husband (who was previously my fiance) and i just drove out to las vegas and got married.
be confident but do not let it control you.
how about being a child beforehand.
do not get a boyfriend on the internet because he could be a sex offender.
life is short so do not squander it.
you should not be acting like this to your sister and past girlfriend.
it would be unusual if it didn't happen but at least you will have tried.
trust me, there are many of them out there.
trust me, i was both naughty and nice.
my favorite activity was going to clubs and having fun all night.
in addition, i can now chase him around the house a lot more.
i don't have any idea, but i understand what you mean.
but i don't want to do it in person.
you can admit o millions of strangers you like a guy, but you can't tell him.
so that twenty-two to twenty-seven thing, they are enjoyable for recreational sport.
i'm not aware myself, i'm really intrigued to know myself.
if it is not an exclusive relationship...
if he is not available and he is happy, then find someone else.
will she ever understand how i felt?
she said it in such a nice way that she made me realize my own wrong doing.
you should hurry to see your gynocologist.
you are beautiful and taltented, moving on is the best option.
my parents embarrass me also.
if your future partner doesn't believe in it then he shouldn't force it on you.
you do not know me so no one believes you.
trust me, sex shouldn't be relied upon to build a relationship.
he is amicable but we are not close.
it depends on how old you are whether you should go to the movies or not.
it is ok if your are not familiar with sexual intercourse.
first you must change your sex appeal towards that man.
i have no experience choosing a partner.
or should i proceed and try it for amusement?
i love sex because it is so enjoyable.
hello, "ham-sandwich." how are you today?
however, some men would do that. why?
help me - i have no driver's license, but i am a hard worker. what should i do next?
he treated her badly and she is not acting intelligently for accepting him again into her life.
not one of them do and he should find a person that does.
you should be aware of the impression that you are making and decide if you have a problem with paying consistently.
you need to consider having a conversation with your boyfriend.
always keep in mind that you must not participate in every disagreement.
i have had the displeasure of some bad kissing parters in my life.
let him be, if he loved you he wouldn't still be with his wife.
find another man and continue on.
what kind of assistance may i offer?
the first time i gazed upon his green eyes!
it was cold, and you did not heat it up.
we went from having sex ten times a week, to zero.
if you do not feel comfortable, adjust, and then proceed.
believe me, he will be back. especially if it was good for him.
how much do you like/love your boyfriend?
don't choose just for the cruise line but also for the ports of call.
when you are kissing and she lets you touch her freely
you n my experience that a large wallet can offset a.
i'm already head over heels if you have nice eyes and awesome hair.
not cocky, it's a good start.
you have to take care of yourself first.
you have to be 18 or older.
not unless she gives you a reason.
do they like girls that young?
my wife would be upset if i didn't date beyonce.
try to listen more.
how is crying all day going to help you?
do as you like.
if he does not change, even if it hurts, we have to leave them.
i am like every male; i am obsessed with it, why else would i have seen her naked?
you can flirt, and make it obvious that you like him.
it always works if you tell him to tell you what you want, otherwise it is over.
maybe it is just me.
i do not believe that makes you gay.
ignore any words he speaks towards you while telling deplorable falsities about him to others.
of course. does there happen to be a man interested in an acquaintanceship?
it is too late.
if there are no kids to think of, then that's preposterous.
you should go ahead and share all of your feelings with him and let him know what your thoughts are on the matter.
younger women are often looking for older men for men with potential to help support them.
as long as you and not hurting anyone i believe that the two of you should go forward.
good luck on your venture and i am sending you warm wishes.
thank you for your interest but i must decline because i am a married woman in a committed relationship.
in reality, the popular girls are not popular at all.
what is the point of liking a girl?
can you fix a car by yourself?
have you ever heard of redbook magazine?
if all you guys want to do is have sex, then fine.
every day is like fighting demons when you wake up.
how can i find the site that has free friends?
he gets girls pregnant then he moves on.
yes, you are very normal!
take your time and focus on the massage by warming up the oil and keeping a hot towel on the side with no noise.
because he is very sweet and very important to me.
my little sister is continuously wanting to be in my company. everywhere i go, she wants to be there.
nothing at all. if you like one another then there is nothing that needs to be repaired.
it is not negative to be a virgin at 19.
there is no reason to be shy.
your virginity will be a gift to your husband if you save yourself until after marriage.
the same as you would for any woman.
if you can not find one out of house then you can try online.
there is not a lot you can do.
he will change if he loves you.
i am experiencing a dilemma because i cannot forget my ex-girlfriend -- i love her.
have you ever paused to think that she may actually truly love you?
it is time that you establish boundaries with him, and make clear that you are not interested.
my boyfriend request that i scream, so i do.
they posture to appear intriguing in front of their peers, or it is simply the way they are.
please save the good stuff for later.
do not get married untill you find your soulmate.
the thing i miss most since i got married is strange. there is nothing better then it.
it depends on what type of wedding you want.
you can talk about your interests, then ask about hers.
men are irritating by definition, and love destroys people.
have a great time at a club!
a woman will be ready for a relationship when she is 28.
he kept knocking things off the table in an odd way.
first base is kissing, second is making out with heavy petting, and third is intercourse.
it is fine if you don't.
if he is willing to cheat after eight months, it won't last long.
i know it is not easy.
masturbation is not a dirty word.
if you are both single, talk with him about those feelings. he might be feeling the same.
why not go after a less attractive guy and you will not have that problem.
take me out old school.
he might, unless he has a girlfriend.
if you are not over your ex, you should not be getting married.
you can date someone who is a year or two your senior if you like.
these things should not be hurried. start your lives over little by little, if you are able.
would you like to schedule a date for it?
from the time i was in middle school through my graduation from college i have experienced many similar situations. rarely do things seem to get easier.
have you considered that they might be jealous? there is nothing wrong with a little jealosy, once in a while.
she asked if we could continue being friends.
also, my mom would be disappointed in me if she found out.
i think this is for the first time in ten years.
i went to his house for a party the day after thanksgiving.
this guy would be so right for me but i feel like i am only fourteen.
oh wait- you are not a man!!!!!
i don't mean anything by it.
since both of her parents are happy, then so is she.
i went out with a certain man last week.
he is in control of the topics you may discuss.
i ask you, is there any reason not to enjoy sexual intercourse?
love is a feeling, not a thought.
i suppose it would depend on the quality of the website you are using.
there are too many good ones out there to waste time on someone you already rejected.
i would like to know more about female ejaculation.
and, i just want a relationship.
people never win games; they always lose in the end.
then, he gets an attitude when i say that men are like children.
my boyfriend is bisexual so it is perfect for me.
but these things cannot be rushed into or it will end up like hell on earth.d
do i have a reason to hope?
and if you believe in jesus.
i cannot speak for other women, but i certainly never do.
they are now in seventh grade and have been best friends since first grade.
a little help would be appreciated.
plus, give yourself a stepping stone.
breast size is 38dd and any age between 16 and 99.
you're doing exactly what you shouldn't be doing.
two wrongs don't make a right.
go to a massage parlor and ask for a happy ending.
if you're both consenting, you can have as much sex as you like.
i think people who behave thuggishly are disturbing and unattractive.
it is the most exciting aspect of sex, the moment that one feels they possess the world.
he invited me over and i accepted.
by removing him from my life?
it is entirely unattractive to me. when a person has unpleasant-smelling breath, i do not want it in my vicinity.
if you have any friends left.
the medication balances everything out.
what cologne do you like?
be yourself, and be nice.
we were afraid to admit it!
how do you know she hates you?
i want her to know how much i love her.
i was lucky no cops were around.
it is okay for men to cry.
she took off her underwear.
it began as a casual conversation that soon involved personal questions. for example, was i married?
i instructed him that i would not engage in any sexual activity with him until i was 16 or 17 years old.
in the event when someone gives presents or compliments a woman.
he is your best friend's significant other and he flirts with you. this is a prime example that he is not a good person.
just enjoy yourself a while longer.
i know i am young, but i don't know what i can do.
i am shocked.
how old are you?
it is probably her overthinking, you just have to talk to her.
you could ask her out for coffee.
if he is,then talk to him a little.
we are going to need a little more information on that one.
you should let your mom know if that guy is a real problem.
it would be inappropriate to post silly questions here.
funny,i guess i will wait and see what happens to her.
gift the man a poster of albert einstein and a card.
obtain opinions from both males and females on the subject.
have patience as the older you get, the harder the problem.
your needs are important in this regard.
i have come to terms that men have different means of expressing themselves.
tell her to have a great day!
my best friend's boyfriend always gives me hugs, talks to me and flirts with me!
the devil's going to rip you a new lifestyle every time, lol.
stop looking for it- you will find it when you least expect it, lol.
i think i am, but i don't know why.
you can't force her to like you.
get back together with your ex-boyfriend and try to work things out.
my live-in boyfriend is getting divorced in two days!
i spend my summer and winter vacations with him.
don't trust women they are cheaters, when they tell you they love you it is just a mind game.
i am guessing that it is to make her feel good about herself.
i am not talking about playing hard to get.
tell him, "hey, i heard that there is this good burger joint in the mall."
in a year you probably will not even like him anymore.
i do not care how attracted i am to him.
the right person for the job will be able to fix anything.
a woman will buy a sex toy because they toy has unlimited stamina.
my first experience with an airplane bathroom was actually the best experience that i have had.
isn't it so often the case that you don't appreciate the value of something until you no longer have it.
take it from me-i have experienced that myself!
does it button up or zip up?
i advise you to wait and see.
i am feeling all warm inside thinking about the picnic with him.
post things that make sense.
some agree while others disagree.
does it have either buttons or zipper?
karma bites back. so i will not do anything until then.
i am blushing as i think about it.
grow up and stop posting pointless answers to my questions.
some people will say yes and some will say no.
i do not believe that those actions mean he has cheated on you. if you do trust him then do not worry if you do not know his passwords.
if you wish to have a romantic relationship with the person...well, you will discover what to do.
i do not recommend to cheat because it will only make the situation more difficult.
in my opinion, he still acts in a stereotypical male manner.
it is still worth your time.
you are a gift sent from heaven.
i think intimacy is fine, a sexual relationship, however, may be a little too soon.
i would like to enter a magic site, however, it asks me this question.
he is getting married this month.
you should indicate that you are interested, even if you are not.
if you want to, get a divorce!
what is kissing a good looking girl like?
find out how he acts around you.
you did not do it right.
get him a magazine subscription to something he likes.
you deserve to be treated better.
he can't leave because he is in love with you.
i see him looking at me every once in a while.
i am only 13 years old and don't want a boyfriend yet, but my best friend has a major crush on him.
it has been my experience...
do not change yourself only for a man.
when i met him, he had two, if any, hairs remaining.
i suppose that is acceptable, provided you are over 18.
this is because you will not have sex with him and he might attempt to rape you.
i feel weird when i see him.
yes, usually the boys do not want to be younger than the girls.
it will happen when you least expect it.
i love you, but i'm not in love with you.
gay men are not usually on the minds of women.
you should go out and have fun too.
romance and intimacy are no longer there.
the first thing you should do is see if he is still loyal or if he has changed.
every other month i do this.
last year i bought my ex sexy pajamas and body paint.
i'm experiencing the same thing and need someone i can talk to!
your man behave like a child, but not all men do.
most girls wouldn't care if you have a sports car, but preppy ones may.
don't give up on your child and her.
list what qualities you want.
it is what you feel comfortable with?
i tell him what i want, and just like burger kings slogan, i have it my way.
they scream when you are raping them.
just follow your heart.
he is in love with me, and would like to marry me when i reach the age of 19.
in some cases, these women finance their men's lives.
just understand how valuable you are, as opposed to objects.
this happens frequently.
there are a lot of nice people around and keep in mind that things always happen for a reason.
that is because most people have more sexual activity when they travel.
no, you should just try to accept it.
i have to tell you that 14 is just too young for this.
it is called valentines day and it certainly is not a holiday for the man.
softness is a sign of life while rigidity is a sign of death.
hint at it first but if he does not understand then tell him clearly.
it is unfortunate that women feel that way.
i would not call my girlfriend any names but i suppose it depends on who you are dating.
my grandparents have a difference of ten years in age!
please try to give me more details...
most of the people are starving for affections or disgusting men from india and all of the other countries.
it does not have to be a male, it does not have to be!
just go out there and say it to her.
because we can do so, and men give in easily.
hire a lawyer and aim to get half of the remainder.
a perfectly good young man has gone to waste.
would it be wrong to broach the subject of his girlfriend again?
there was oral sex with no obligation.
if i could only choose one?
if this makes you a popular person then the mission was accomplished.
only looking for her will be effective, she will not be found through an internet search, nicky.
that is dependent on age.
i do not know his feelings, and that upsets me.
it is lust, but lust may become love.
there is no age limit. if you find true love when you are young, that is amazing!
i wish i could date beyonce any day, any time.
you need to tell him to go over there and get cleaned up.
is proposing when you ask to marry someone? and does spouse mean husband or wife?
in the last 5 years i have never dated anyone.
you ought to realize that she does it because she admires you. it is a compliment and you should enjoy it.
whoever is more attractive and received better tips that night.
he is probably homosexual and trying very hard to be attracted to women but is simply unable to.
allow space to record his suggestions as well.
what emotions do you feel when you are in his presence?
if you do not know, then guess what you are.
find someone who likes you for being you, and not what you have.
if you can go to another state, that is better.
they have an urge to have sex and play around.
there is another issue that you do not seem to notice.
if you do not want a comitment as well that is fine.
i does not matter what gentleman you like you can still like green day, they do not have to like it.
lets say if something was wrong with them.
focus on the both of you first.
do not fret about it, you have an adequate amount of time!
just because this relationship did not work out does not mean that all men are idiots.
are you able to do that?
as the old saying goes, "try it! you might like it!"  best of luck.
they haven't had time to figure out what love is.
you could get your heart broken.
i still understand his reasoning, a
you do not want to protect someone who is unsure of himself.
why is something trivial occupying your mind?
you should worry until he gets out of hand.
there is plenty to be pleased with.
i want it to be more than just a card, and i've not had any ideas.
i wanted to fornicate with him very much.
if you need to question, than it is too late.
i know the obvious answer that many are likely thinking, if he loves you, you will be okay.
i was left to my own.
try and avoid negative statements. statements similar to, "i can't do this." or "i'm only doing this due to loneliness.".
at least this way you can both say you have a chance at life.
i advise that you change your perspective on what a real man is before searching for one.
well, what you should say is "my darling, i love you more than the stars love the night sky".
they're only human so it's much more common than you think. that said, you shouldn't cry over 'spilled' milk since this is pretty normal for most people.
people get hurt over words said.
that is how my relationship is with my wife.
not literally,you have to hit him where it hurts.
do a lot of kissing and stroking.
do not go to the wedding.
enjoy your childhood-do not be in too much of a hurry to grow up.
besides, just about any woman wants to find a man who will make her laugh.
if a person keeps their information password protected, they are likely doing so to hide something.
all she wants is to be able to spend time with you.
that is a very sweet way of acting.
do you think i should ask him out?
if so, just talk to the guy.
men can cry; like any human being.
i want him to be taller then me, honest, but not too nice.
that means they misplaced their wallet, and have to wait untill later to get that pack.
in my opinion, you should leave him.
he gave me his phone and i put my number in it.
if you do this, you will both get a chance to do what you enjoy.
find the root of the problem.
most men that i know do not like a woman who is insecure.
are you not aware of how to speak english properly?
i wonder what the outcome would have been if i had told her that she smelled bad.
is this what you thought it was going to be?
if you treat a woman like a queen every day, it will be enough for her.
kick him to the curb.
go for whatever she wants.
if you are a creative person, make out little coupons with ideas like 'one free date.'
i just had my first child 14 months ago.
are you watching too many adult films?
you don't feel that way anymore.
it is your responsibility to them orgasm.
that is the climax!
we got a man around here just like that.
for some countries this not okay.
i knew a girl that was old fashioned once, she's old now!
see if you can join and mate her.
be like the nicky commercials, just do it.
what is kissing an ugly girl like?
i don't understand why today's women feel bad when a man buys them lunch.
when she isn't ready for it or is under the weather.
last time  it was overwhelming because he was working a lot.
most i,pirtantly, be her friend and see where it leads.
he keeps glancing at you!
take your time and do not rush into anything.
if you have to ask, you do not know.
it is not easy, but it is for the best.
it is just the demon in your mind.
the best way to attract a female is to be original, funny and most importantly, be confident.
a better pick-up line would have been: "a hot single latino has arrived for one lucky hot lady, hurry!"
they have a little thing called their ego.
i haven't thought about this in a very long time. i am 40 years old.
if she hates it, i don't think she would make a good match for you.
it puts your problem into perspective and gives you time to breathe.
if he is gone, you should refrain from chasing him.
the easiest way to stop worrying is to stop constantly looking.
it appears you have already decided what you need to do.
there is a chance and he will both want to hang out with you and also pick on you at the same time.
if you put forth a lot of effort in this engagement that might become be expected norm every time you see her.
i am 23 years old and a graduate student.
you should ensure that they are okay with this decision before you move forward with it.
this is not something that you should rush into instead you should set your own pace and move forward as things progress.
do you believe that i am attractive just by judging my avatar?
you should read cosmopolitan because they have interesting information that you can use to make your sex life more interesting.
you should not insult him because you are frustrated unless you would like to him respond in the same manner.
you should ask him on a date and tell him you are fond of him. at that point, you can see where your actions lead you.
perhaps you do have an unintelligent man. you have my sympathy if that is the case.
they do not like to be in front of an audience.
she needs to be honest with her man to keep him.
someone was arguing at the bar.
sounds like you were afraid.
as somebody who used to be shy, take my advice, and kiss her.
that's how i am trying to find a boyfriend.
there is a cringing sound echoing through the bar.
you have to be able to take risks to make it through life.
i like you- and i'm 25
i feel like i was cheated.
try to sleep it off- no- just kidding.
be yourself and be nice to her.
when we experience it ourselves, we dint more no callingbit loc
let him know upfront that all you want to be is friends.
if you really like him, do it.
i'm sorry it happened, but i hope you find someone loyal.
it's not a big deal at this age.  just be glad you aren't 25-30.
good for you, if you are the one she chooses.
you want to be in a relationship with someone who shares similar interests with you.
my kids are 17, 19, and 21 years old.
you did the right thing, that is considered cheating.
if he makes fun of you, he is not worth being in a relationship with.
you knew her boyfriend was jealous, yet you covered for her.
an option while dressing is to attempt to be alluring, though it is necessary to avoid the lascivious while maintaining intrigue.
there are some of this type, including me, left in the world; i urge you to look more intently.
he obtained for himself the companionship of a lady who was not yet out of her teen years.
my deepest apologies, but unfortunately there are certain measures which are outside of my control.
if he is just like you describe, do you really want to be another check on his list?
i am trying to be clean for stress relief.
he usually gets much more sleep.
if they like that girl...
there is nothing wrong with you.
when he saw you did he say it is over?
try being single for a good bit, think about what your priorities are and then go fishing.
if you think he is cheating then just ask him, you only have to ask.
because of the way he looks at me.
give me a ring, give me a ring now, let's have a conversation.
you would make a wonderful friend.
much like the woman on top said, it is very hard.
when young men attempt to date girls that are their age.
men do not hide as much as women do.
for instance, to find your email address or phone number.
good luck, you are going to need it!
tell him he knows him very well.
he had to have taken that picture 20 years earlier.
tell her you would like to get help with her.
i am not sure if i gained anything in love, but i lost my dear friend.
men think my perfume is awful.
you do not want to make things worse.
my friends like something other than the type of men i like.
let him go but keep him on a leash.
i have no idea how to answer this frustrating question.
it was late and i fell asleep in his living room.
there are very young girls out there just like me.
this is a hard answer.
one of my good friends is 15 and used to cut herself.
let her know how much you care.  find little ways to keep showing her.
what use is being wealthy if you feel lonely and unwanted?
i care about this man, but i need suggestions on how to tell him. i have trouble breathing in his presence.
well, nothing, unless you want him to return.
that way you will not feel as though you must do everything.
as a matter of fact, you do not have to get married.
there was not enough hair for a comb-over.
you can talk to a counselor near where you live.
let him know you as a person.
this guy tony had no respect for you. stay with the one you love.
they are trying to feel better for themselves, because they feel awful.
tell the man you have feelings for him.
if the girl likes you it will not matter to her.
if they are lucky enough. i do not think they are though.
my sister and her boyfriend have had relations for a year and they are happy.
because they are not respectable and only want sexual relationships.
quite simply, he likes you and wants to get to know you more.
they are right around you so you don't have to look as hard.
is my ex-wife really sick and to what extent
a nice dinner at home, a walk in the park, and a full body massage from you.
you have sex with one to two people annually.
if you were a male who were not queer?!
they just do not process thoughts like we women do!
may i please have your electronic mailing address?
so was i in the wrong or what should i say, thank you.
getting angry and acting like an idiot will not help either.
does he look you in the eyes?
eat as much as you can and get straight to it. that usually does the job for me.
then he asked me, "can i accompany you?"
do not ask me, for i am a woman. my brother lives in washington d.c.
when i look at you.
even if you decide to part the company.
just the eyes and nothing else.
you're only asking this question because you must feel guilty.
how will i know when i am in love?
you should visit a gynecologist to rule out any possibilities.
a young girl is not your style.
i love the old mode of white and light pink, but pink and violet are also good.
thus he is encouraged. all right, she is laughing at my joke. i'm not going ruin it either !
have the family over for a great dinner, serve her favourite homemade or store bought dessert, and put the ring in the dessert.
i just adore brittany murphy.
you should recriprocate the actions that he did to you.
what sort of look is it?
i hope that i was able to help you.
it is fine if you are able to deal with him giving attention to other women.
if you cannot find anything that you are interested in, i do not believe it will work and cannot offer anymore advice.
perhaps you are searching too hard for someone who is exactly the same as the last woman you dated.
i question what she is smoking.
what if business were to go well but the romance does not?
my wife was sneaking around and wrote that, i think she pretends like i am not an overweight man.
you need to sense her feelings.
keep in mind that no one knows that i am gay.
men have problems with women because they tend to get nervous.
ask him by striking up a conversation.
when he does get his butt off his shoulder.
tell them you fear for your safety.
make sure to dress nicely and flirt, giving him your full attention.
i always get confused about that.
then, i found out he only had the email addresses of the women.
i need to buy something at the mall.
i did not like it when i had to let them control my life while in school.
you will not be able to change what you are, no matter what you do.
let him know you need your space.
they do not eat and only gossip about others.
masturbation caused you to lose your virginity.
girls can only decide.
ask him, and tell him what bothers you.
they have to make me laugh, and have a nice body.
we know what we want and won't budge.
do it based on the evidence that men are irrational.
i do not think you should be doing that because sooner or later he is going to hurt you.
when people get drunk, things happen.
that is awesome but it takes work to keep it that way.
what if he is both creepy and cute?t
there is no attraction or connection so how to you say it is over?
you should be able to cry and let all that emotion out.
in the meanwhile, these men spend very little to no money on them and receive all the the action they require.
once a cheater always a cheater. if he behaves like this to his girlfriend, he will most likely do it to you as well.
you should experiment with some toys and even movies to make the relationship more kinky.
in my opinion, i feel that astrology is not real.
i would advise you to seek employment so you can be independent. it is simple. i have been doing it since i was 16, and now i am 21.
do not worry about her possibly rejecting you. there are plenty of other women in the world to try and bond with. you do not need her to survive and be happy.
most importantly, follow your instincts and feelings.
try to be relaxed. do not ask a lot of questions. one tip would be to wear b.o.d.
first you must ask her politely. if she does not get off, then you will have to push her off.
chicks with "richards" sort of scare me too.
you just have to find them.
well we are speaking of virginity.
no i don't think so, but i'm worried about not having one and i'm thirteen.
i don't practice what i preach.
it is a great excuse to hold a woman close, even one you do not know.
ask her what she thinks, and how she feels.
do you ever think about the guy?
i will know from real life experience when i am old enough.
just go up to her and start talking.
have you asked him if he really likes you?
i always thought we would get back together eventually.
if it does not work out, let it go.
make yourself happy, whatever that means.
both have three teenagers and they are all good kids.
keep in mind that it will get easier.
get out there where people can see you and get to know you.
even though we are friends, i really want to go out with her!
do you need more info than my screen name? it is oletennesseanchic17.
please refer to him about your concern as we can not help you.
socialize with just one of the four persons of most interest to you.
attempt to focus on your goals and aspirations while maintaining respect and care for others.
if you are adament about pursuing a divorce, proceed with it.
her opinion may change if you become intimate with her.
you have fifteen years due to hurricane katrina.
tell her to get on one knee if you are n a public place.
i kind of mean sexually....
if she accepts your proposal, then she is the one!
geez, i wish we could talk!
there ia lady in the house.
finding nice guys is hard to locate.
happy guys are hard to find.
the size is perfect, not to large or to small.
that person is healthly.
do not lie to yourself.
sign up for an online dating website.
either he was going to do it, or he was not.
ignoring her will save you pain later, if you care about her.
most of the time when males have a relationship with an unattractive female, can only be seen in a motion picture.
just be yourself. trust me. it works. good luck.
he gently massage my back and gave me another hug.
why is it that some males have a difficult time telling a female how they feel about her?
and if you two are still in love consider counselling.
i am true to myself and i love my life.
but to another person is what i meant.
it is not fun to be more mature.
just stay on the path. it is much easier.
if you chose to, you should get out of it quickly.
i enjoy seeing the things he is interested in.
the issue is, if he cares, he is going to be apprehensive towards you.
if you need help, you are more than welcome to e-mail me.
i am still in love with the father of my child.
because with separate ones, they hear one side of the story only and cannot draw any firm conclusions.
no, one cannot be born gay, it is a choice one makes.
age is not relevant to love or marriage.
i regret to inform you that it is primarily at their workplace, a laundromat, walmart, or online.
the go to a doctor for advice and assistance.
we have had difficulties that we have overcome.
if i were a male, i would ask her out.
it is not necessary to do this with her.
i am cute, and my boyfriend is very jealous.
if there are not any suitable gentlemen out there then why would you have one?
absolutely because love is love and there is nothing else like it.
they do not think about the same things.
i had known my husband for eight months.
he more than likely did not want a relationship at all.
consider this. will you remember this event three decades from now?
let the man know that you have found someone who is better than him.  let him know to keep his distance from you.
disregard the fact that your friends are getting married.  it does not mean you need to get married as well.
if she does not want to partake in those actions, then she does not have to.
do not desperately attempt to vigorously flirt with men.  you come off as pathetic.
on any chat website you can find similar areas.
what is the origin of this idea that virginity is a problem?
rough handling and two minutes of brief sex isn't going to satisfy most women.
i have a great man. if you read my question, he is not the one i need to break up with.
try to think of ways to make your marriage more interesting.
don't listen to them, listen to me.
you can make friends by asking people.
have you ever heard the expression "true love waits"?
think more strongly about how to determine what you want to do.
girl, this is 2006. make your move before it's too late and he finds someone else.
when i woke up he greeted me good morning and made me mac and cheese.
kind of creepy. thirteen is a bit young for anyone. messing with preteen emotions is never good.
so yeah. go ahead and do it.
don't do anything they don't want to do or are not ready for.
time is precious; i hope this helps.
also consider her girlfriends who will be part of the judgement.
don't only have sex while you are in bed.
don't you think girls can't think of what to say?
okay, first completly shave the beard from your face.
you can not rewind time.
do not have sex before marriage.
girls forget what to say sometimes.
cut your beard first.
what ever you chose to do, do not go to a movie.
how can i make my two bestfriends be friends with each other again?
if you love him, you should give him a chance.
he got off the train at his stop.
there are some movies that i have not seen yet.
if you want to email me and we could talk.
trust me i was that guy.
because we always have to have it our way.
just ignore him if he talks to you, and allow your friend to like him.
do not listen to that woman nothing happens for her either.
you should not be with somebody that you can not trust.
ask a mutual friend who he likes.
is it because you do not have children?
call him at work and ask him out.
if  you have applied nair to remove hair from your genitals, you have taken the concept to an extreme.
i despise the desires of women to tear each other down.
it would be appropriate to express complaints if he was spending your money.
however, virginity has no effect on health or romantic relatonships.
i believe hygiene is an important aspect.
i think people look foolish while dancing.
your lover will return if your love was sincere; otherwise, you did not possess true love.
i want to learn because it helps men attract partners for casual sex.
the only man who doesn't cry is chuck norris.
start a group and become unique.
do not trust them completely.
people lie and are unfaithful more than they have at any point in the past.
my feeling while doing it was, "why can this not be my wife?"
you have not yet found the right person
maybe a joke in return, not meant for revenge but for fun.
as long as it is legally sound, it is acceptable.
if you were the one to invite her to lunch, it is you who should pay.
dust yourself off and see the world, enjoy yourself.
we are men, and they are women.
it is often hard to find a gift for men.
don't arouse her, just amuse her, forcing someone is a bad idea.
you have a shot of it working in your favor.
men feel that porn is representative of sex.
i try to get his attention, but it doesn't work.
it depends on how open the girl is.
he would come up to me and do it without noticing.
you can trust me, it worked for me.
a woman that is 21 and in college, then no.
i think it could survive. why wouldn't it?
you deserve better than that!
did you pay with check or cash?
you guys make it look difficult.
would you buy a house on fire?
the mess is between the two of them.
guys love girls that perform oral sex but do not bring them home.
all goths and emos hate you.
that is a stunningly perfect thing.
all you have to is what is best for both you and him.
you must have time for that as well.
men find it difficult to tolerate feminine behaviors.
it is not a substitute, i actually enjoy physical education.
i am already in love with someone else.
in general, treat her as if she is a good friend already, and you will surely be successful.
hello, i can possibly provide assistance.
i feel that it is a bit too late.
i am not in india, but i believe you may want to sleep with me.
well, i have known myself best my entire life.
you must ponder over it.
in this event, use caution because it is subjective from the point of view of the judge.
it is immaterial if one more female reunites with a lover and is subsequently tossed aside another time.
in this case, he will still need to provide payment.
next, he implored, "would it please you to intertwine with me, diane?"
of sufficient age to recognise true love, and of sufficient sophistication not to mangle it.
do not walk around looking sad, but make him want you!
i was very shy before i went to college, and that did not attract women.
i hope  your girlfriend yells at you just for asking such a thing!
i do not know as i have been sidelined lately.
however, you should wait until the right time.
such as with a vehicle, you have to be willing to find the correct person who is able to repair it.
i believe that you are talking nonsense.
if you can't find a person to have sex with, it's best to masturbate.
these men like to admire older women.
i am okay with it as long as you do not try to make me crash.
it is not a necessity to be involved in a romantic relationship.
is safe sex the equivalent of sex performed legally?
continue on your present path if it will result in a desirable outcome for both of you.
you can not simultaneously sail two boats, so apply this lesson to your relationships and remain with shaun if you love him.
i believe he is being unfaithful to me and we are merely fourteen, however he is employed in repairing roofs.
perhaps that is why he took them!
it would be unfortunate if you did not try to intervene and her situation worsened.
i accepted it.
no, that is not a positive approach.
does it mean that she fancies me? or it is just a friendly offer?
he'd want to spend more time with you than just engaging in sexual activity. he'd also call you.
typically, i'll provide him with a few things to say to her when we are together.
i'm not in the mood to go anywhere.
maybe i'm just tired. maybe i had a difficult day at work. do you know what i mean?
friends, family, love and relationships.
it would be nice if you wanted to do that.
you need to speak to her and forget about how hard it is.
here is my life of what make men appear to be stronger.
there are many people who can relate to you.
if it were like that, sex would not be any fun.
if your girlfriend is truly lesbian, i do not see that very much can be done.
that's far to young to get married, it is best to not have sexual intercourse.
i was one of them, so you should trust me.
they will not let you be sad or in pain.
when you think he is the one.
my brother married someone five years older than he is, age shouldn't matter.
become friends with her first, get to know her, talk to her and then tell her you like her.
having a lot of good friends doesn't mean you are popular.
try not to make it out to be to much of a big deal.
the best way to find out if he likes you is to ask.
hello muncher.  my name is jack, and i am somewhat familiar with the topic you discuss.
you may ask him or have a friend ask on your behalf, but he may say no when in truth he does for.
i cannot summon the strength to speak with her or look at her without wishing to scream.
it is all in the timing of the lord, not our own.
suggestions on how to improve my mood?
additionally, if the situation gets worse, seek help immediately.
tone it as an daily habit.
sure, i should listen to the person asking this question.
my birthday is august 1st and my zodiac sign is the leo.
necking is when you nuzzle someones neck. no that is not.
no, if it is in his name then it belongs to him.
that would depend on your location of conversation.
marriage is terrible, that is why you should not marry.
if he will not or cannot stop, you ought to ask why.
when possible, placing your mouth near her ear is arousing.
staying together for the child is not positive for anyone.
i believe they like poetry
why must you ask, enjoy while you can, it is amazing!
your first impressions are quite important, does he appear to be a good man?
what do you think of this?
she assaulted her boyfriend badly.
the only thing left to consider is if it is worth losing what i have now.
first you need to ...after that say you require additional assistance...continue in that fashion.
if not something is amiss.
remember why you got married, don't dwell on the small things that don't matter(such as leaving the toilet seat up).
he will not appreciate any gift you give him.
if he has wasted more money on you, then maybe you should.
anything is possible, i just have not found the one yet.
she has something that he likes and you do not.
i would not believe a simple comment like that would be flirting at all.
i think he will say these words to you: "just remember this, and god bless you, sweetie."
but, only say it if you do.
maybe you should not even worry about this right now.
stop vacillating and get back on the horse.
there are people out there that don't care about anyone but themselves .
if you don't tell her that you just want to stay good friends.
no woman is worth your time if she doesn't want you.
don't mess you life up with him girl!
men don't like to talk much.
did you read his body language?
how old are you? i would love to chat, please reply.
pucker up, or get naked.
the truth is variety is the spice of life.
if you have someone else ask him, he might not be interested.
marriage is quite difficult.
not now, due to the fact that the recently contracted a cough and has been placed into counseling.
look straight at him, straight into his eyes, and tell him.
i would imagine that would be true, i have recently seen a few.
you should continue looking at him, until it becomes noticeable, and then smile while winking. : )
if you are untruthful repeatedly protest and make excuses then it will be over.
if we are loud then you will know you are good.
the outcome for this scenario is i think that he is shy.
i believe the age for maturity is 21 years of age.
it is two hundred miles from you, at yahoo.
this is your time to be pampered, not his.
keep things clean down below, it's a good thing.
i know it is hard.
his problem is not liking you, that is not your fault.
just like you i always answer no to that question.
when you find the right person for you you feel in your heart and know that it is true.
this seems hard for you now because you are scared to try.
you should be confident in yourself and enjoy what you do; girls really appreciate your honesty.
i believe the reason that he broke up with you is because he is scared of a long-term commitment.
if ne notices you, you might have a chance.
saw what you feel about her, truly and sincerely.
maybe they have lost your e-mail address?
what kind of girls do you look for?
as an example: celebrity gossip, fashion, rules of relationships, etc.
i do not believe so, because women truly like the real man.
if it is not too hot at that time of year, you could even get married on a baseball diamond.
i do not know about other men.
let's keep in touch via messenger.
my legs are sore from all that walking.
if the weather is comfy you can get married while the sun is setting.
he can only speak for himself.
let's be friends on messenger.
i think you should try explaining to your wife, the situation.
happy valentine's day to you too.
he is just trying to be difficult, trust be because i am a black female.
if you love your girl, ask her to marry you.
the first time i tried, i found a new desire that seemed to take control of my life.
how is acting like this going to make her feel better about herself?
i know, that's what i do.
no matter what, do not take sides.
just because a lot of men have liked my long hair, they aren't necessarily flirting with me.
do not try to make this man happy.
without hurting her feelings, please tell her that it smells down there and she needs to douche.
i wish guys could just be honest.
some of us are just quiet.
please put a single rose on each plate; if there are a  lot of people attending, make it for the main tables only.
if that continues, that will be the end of civilization.
give him a little space, and do not call him for awhile. let him miss you, and call you.
men are always pulling stuff like that.
talk to her in a serious way.
beat the everloving stuff out of her.
you do not know you are in love, you feel it. and i am not talking about sex.
if they aren't true loyal friends you will know.
lawyers are needed in certain situations.
in one hundred words can you tell me any negative effects of family planning.
think of a vacation or some other time you spent with each other, then ask random questions about it.
you should start to worry if he is broke.
give her a dumb look.
no, not all girls are like this. just don't give priority to the girls that don't care for your feelings.
i have no clue why your asking!
why would you want someone?
going slower is always better in the long run or the bigger picture.
what about gymnasts?
i don't understand.
your education and culture have taught you to stop yelling.
she isn't going to the movies anymore.
maybe him, but what about your mother?
some women unfortunately think love equals money.
there is no drama happening between you and him.
for instance you could try the following: nick denny + ne, nick denny + nebraska or try nicholas denny.
if you really love them than it does not matter.
if he does accept, would you want that?
that's not something a normal friend would do.
i have learned a lot from my best friend who's wonderful to me.
when both parties are participating in oral sex.
i am sure you will feel good!
no one but you knows what is in your best interests.
the two people who fought with each other made up long ago.
i am naturally thin, but that does not make me anorexic.
if you treat your wife with respect and love everyday, you relationship will never sour.
if you actively seek love, you will instead find trouble.
if you are questioning whether you are in love, then you are not, my dear.
it is all about trust.
if the answer is no, they never truly were.
i am unaware of your physical appearance.
you do not want her to believe that you only have one thing on your mind.
she begged me for sex, and that is what we did.
most men will think you have done that.
if he does, how do i approach this person that i am beginning to like?
and maybe she thinks the same thing about you.
i am 11. you should pick out guys that you like, and hang around them. the hot ones try to notice, but might not.
he even told my mother than he wishes to be with me.
girls are much more easier to impress than you seem to believe.
well, i know that one well.
regardless, it is because they left an impact.  when you fall in love again, thoughts of your first love will come to you automatically.
i once thought i had one.  but one day without realizing it, i met someone and now we are the best of friends.
all of them, except the ugly ones.
she could just be mellow.
it is upsetting that we are so worried about looks.
i don't think there is anything wrong with being attracted to feet.

most rebellious people seek love, so just try to be affectionate instead of possessive.
i need to know, so i would appreciate if you would leave a message.
choose a person who is reliably supportive.
next time, spell-check.

well i have more male friends than female friends.
i am relatively intelligent, is that something i can use?
a white ipod nano would be nice, however.
you are too young to be thinking about that. you have your whole life ahead of you.
as i stated, i feel for you and i truly mean it!
i'm not sure if i should or shouldn't.
does anyone have any advice for me? please help!
i don't know if it feels good to a female because i've never experienced it.
are you talking about walks on the beach?
because if you cheated on him, what's the point in being his friend?
however, it doesn't sound like he is very happy with her.
you know, for me, being a single parent is very tough, but it also depends on the person; why?
oh yes, what's your best friend's name?
if you attempt that, insure you're not currently at a cyber cafe.
it is the least amount you can do.
principally, you're cheating on her emotionally.
approach him, attempt to not act shy. if you never speak to him, you'll never know.
they haven't learned yet that not everyone is a friend.
show them that you are braver than they are.
you should if valentine's day is important to you.
i need you opinion, she want's to put me in jail so she can get custody of the kids. what should i do?

do not hate yourself.
i am not a cowgirl, or a countryfried redneck.
i got a new jaguar.
what is wrong with you? that is too old.
maybe you never tried to love him. then you would understand him.
you should tell them not to pressure you.
you should ask your boyfriend to determine if she is lying.
they treat their significant other as a prize that must be perfect.
my friends are much happier after doing that.
you can figure it out.
who told you that you are good?
my favorite dreams are when i fly.
she likes you, too, if you always talk.
o wise fool, you have spoken.
hello, i heard you are dating ___, so that is great. wait for his answer.
and he will come back if he is the love of your life.
play pool, drink tea, and do not worry about having a long-term relationship.
because that means i would do it and not say anything.
if you wanted to, you would listen to me.
you are not ready yet if you cannot talk about it.
try to invent a time machine.
if you're cheated then you probably will not.
what do you look like, what are your attributes?
do you want to know why she doesn't trust you?
they want me to be someone i am not.
you will know how to discuss the matter when you're both ready.
not all women suffer abuse. men that have mental issues typically are abusive towards their women.
try saying, "i love you".
the woman was supposed to be a suprise for him. if not, you should go together.
i think a lot of guys pass up some good women because of their looks.
trust is what holds relationships together.
maybe you just did. if he reads these too.
if she glares at you or turns her head, it is time to move on.
he matches you with his life choices, that shows how much he really cares for you.
if you have to ask this question, then yes she probably is.
yes, you should walk her to her locker, and talk to her to tell her how you feel.
i do not think it should matter.
your sister should open her eyes about him.
i hope this helps you out.
not in my dreams.
if you like it, then go ahead.
whatever he tells you about the phone being off, use the same excuse back at him.
love makes you do things you would not normally do.
congratulations, i like the idea of getting married on valentines day.
you are young, it is better when you are in your twenties.
in my opinion i believe you can kiss at any age, be sexually active passed the age of fifteen, and once you are eighteen you can do whatever you wish.
some men are rude and uneducated.
grandma, you used to make such beautiful cakes.
i dislike all the guys out there that abuse their girlfriends and wives.
choose one and hope she doesn't find out about the other one.
go and ask him out for a date.
i know this question isn't love and romance but i really wanna know.
so basically all you are doing is breaking a heart.
go to my q&a and select the avatar.
we are seeking men, however, not in the same way that men seek women.
simply continue to converse with people; you are certain to discover people, even if they are not suitable romantic partners.
it seems that you love your boyfriend greatly.
most men desire women whom they cannot attain and about whom they can only fantasize.
you need to regain your composure.
i was a virgin bride at the age of 28.
most women are not nice, however, i am not one of them.
i am interested in a woman that sits in front of me in history.
i have issues opening up about myself.
perhaps he is ashamed, or perhaps he has more shallow motives.
i'm sure you are aware that men tend to behave that way.
i would love to use my tongue with a woman in wild ways, with the use of my tongue ring.
i am not quite sure that he cares about me any longer.
when dating, i do not pay heed to outward appearances, so long as they do not go beyond reason.
if he is in a relationship, leave him alone and find someone else.
do you want to feel?
i like their eyes, they can tell alot about people that they dont want you to know.
you have not found the right man yet, so do not give up.
i can not help the way i feel.
it that similar to the two gay irish guys that got married.
bring them on, anytime.
i could not help it. i am heterosexual, and proud if it.
also, if you can play in instrument- that is instant sex appeal!
here is an update for both of you about what is going on.
that will surely help you gain his love.
spend time with family and friends.
whomever asked for the date should pay.
when he gives me that, flowers on the side is an added bonus and makes me feel special.
it's no alright to cheat. you won't get anywhere in life.
get him something that he really likes.
it might seem like a date, but there are some differences.
you should tell him that you like him.
it is all about what you are confortable with. but if it were me, i would feel totally weird.
i think it would strengthen any kind of relationship between you.
have a great time. i'm hoping that you send me an invitation to your wedding. congratulations.
the only thing i can say is "good luck."
maybe you should attempt in engaging in a romantic relationship with a female as opposed to a feline. that would help you out a lot.
be patient and see what he does.
i love my husband, however, i believe that i have feeling for someone else.
i only like body builders who are not too muscular and who do not constantly keep their shirt off.
that all depends on how he feels about you using his name on the internet.
this is because they are shy and immature.
for instance, wear an apron and nothing else, etc.
he cannot control you if you do not allow him to control you.
sweetie, you will eventually grow up and discover that not all men are foolish and strange.
i am still attempting to lose romantic feelings for a former partner, whom i have not seen in almost four years.
let me know what you think.
this is not true of toothpicks, humorously.
however, they continue to call me and invite me to a date. why?
make certain you are trying and not being indolent.
it may not happen every time. remember it is all in the mind.
because it is a man telling his woman that she means a lot to him.
and women allow them to, so why not?
it tends to be because they do not believe it or are afraid to say it to their face.
if she rejects you remember that i will always be here.
we are talking about men so of course it is possible.
get printed business cards with the date of the wedding, name, et cetera.
regardless, i have met some great people who were in wheelchairs and went on to find love in their life.
if you have to ask, i doubt that you know yet.
firstly, ask him what actions he would take if he discovered you cheated.
it is not difficult to pick up men; simply walk up to the man you are interested in and ask him on a date.
i would not want to forfeit this friendship, however, i have reason to believe he likes me as well!
i do not know your age and it does not matter.
this is just for the moment. if you get married, who knows what it will be like.
if they leave you, it isn't meant to be.
check you local junior or senior high school there are tons of boys.
what can i do without hurting her?
are they always attracted to just looks?
use more of them.
they will not allow one who does not match their desired profile to have an opportunity to be successful.
i do not find it acceptable and neither do you.
i find the situation amusing and wish him all success however, will he swallow if he loves himself?
i am sorry for your situation my dear, however he has found a new romantic partner so you must cease to pursue him.
i suppose it is determined by the nature of questions you are asking.

once you get out, do not go back.
when fantasy becomes reality, reality can be very scary.
i suppose they think it is cool to be dominant in the relationship.
yes, but it's not as quick with a woman with nice firm cleavage.
you have to work hard at finding them.
i think she could be interested, so good luck!
read the book, he is just not interested in me.
she could be mad at you.
aren't we human as well? why do men abuse us? what do they take away from this?
if you can't wait, you should stop liking him.
it is all how you work it.
i gave up.
if you are beautiful, then the answer is no. if you are ugly, then the answer is yes.

i believe i have three, also.

pay no attention to people who try to convince you this site doesn't offer aid in dating, they are simply cruel people.
he will not tell me he loves me, even after a year and a half.
you are way too young.

in all honesty women do have the upper hand in most situations.
most men, like myself, do not like to let our guard down our of fear of being viewed as weak.
love, not sex, is the key to making a good marriage.
it is up to you if you want to do that.
take it easy.  time will tell
most guys do not like to be seen as weak when they let their guards down.
love, not sex, is the making of a good marriage.
it is up to you.
eventually i was able to move past it.
if you are seeking a wonderful life, you must first give yourself over to god.
to be honest, gentlemen are fun but certainly not worth risking a great friendship over.
please explain why you believe your girlfriend is cheating on you.
you have a terrible attitude and i would advise you drop the act and be intimate with the man you love.
it was gentle and felt appropriate for that specific evening.
there are many other options, but you are searching in all the wrong places.
i am unable to count at this moment.
if you have even the slightest hesitation or doubt, you should not go through with it.
try to squeeze your rear end and it will be similar.
what should i do?  we love each other so much we can't live without one another.
i don't think having a different gender person as a friend is embarrassing.
the best outcome would be that he likes you both.
take them.  maybe you will meet somebody.
we are always hanging on each other.  he always says he loves me.
no, you should not engage in sexual intercourse until you are married.
are you worried about getting married?
yes, i would rather love and lose than never love at all.
you may use that if you wish.
if you know your guy, you should be able to tell whether or not he is lying.
wait until you are married to have sex!
wait until you are married.
yes, you may borrow it.
you can tell if your man is being truthful.
if your eyes were closed, would you know the difference?
yes, and it is undesirable to have everyone stare at you. then you experience the worst part: guilt.
my boyfriend dislikes women kissing each other.
i tell her to deal with it and use the support for its intended purpose.
i want to give him something creative.
i am not positive that you would be incarcerated because that is a large amount.
if that is the decision you pursue, you should not get pregnant unless you are married.
i favor both options, which one do you prefer?
do not put forth less effort at something.
here is a suggestion, why don't you tell your boyfriend to tell that other woman that he does not have feelings towards her.
go to a bar or a rich and famous theater .
my legs are nice and long, but my butt is pretty wide.
he is a jerk. you do not leave a person waiting like that.
when i make a mistake, they do not harshly punish me.
is he a male friend of the family?
if you can provide quality evidence please tell me. thank you.
is that person the individual he claims to be?
do not get involved with the wrong type of guy.
he is the only one.
let's talk about men.
yes, i do love him and i want only him.
i can have any guy i want but i want a christian man.
boys are not that hard to find, but make sure you don't fall for the wrong one.
when you asked was it him?
they are probably disussing a guy.
and yeah i loved him, and couldn't see myself with anyone else.
most guys would jump at being with you.
you are weak-willed to end a relationship with a man just because his appearance is not up to your standard.
first befriend him or her.
or simply a relationship for enjoyment?
i simply wish to see what transpires when you discover the difficult way.
most likely, if he is unlikely to contact you, he is not worth it.
i would just tell him to shove off because you're better than that.
the first step is to become aracnia, then you can sign up for sites such as linkedin or doostang.
you're not supposed to be leaking information to anyone about this matter, bill.
i wouldn't change anything.
i have complete confidence in you.
do not portray yourself as someone you are not, simply be yourself and do not lie at all.
no, i was married on valentine's day and it was a disaster.
find a new one, such as his best friend.
if he is sincere then, most likely, he is not misleading you.
so, they tend to try to live through their children.
you could try talking to a friend or family member. that may help.
it's more than likely that the guy that you're with is just dealing with sensation overload.
if i had to guess, i would say it meant that you danced so much that it wore through the rug.
ask god to bless you with one.
it is not love if you have to ask.
do not do it if you think it won't go over well.
you would not like him so much if he said he loved you.
small candles wrapped in small bags and tied with pretty ribbon.
how much do you love your boyfriend?
i do not know what he is expecting, nor how he is expecting it.
if you begin something, and it does not feel right, then stop.
that is the way to do it. intensify it!
sometimes, it is a blessing in disguise.
however, i suppose that if you want to do that, and you behave ethically towards each other, there may not be a reason to refrain.
but don't get frantic, he may just want a guys night out with no females to nterupt things.
just ask him if is with anyone else, and how he feels towards you.
i don't believe it's rape if they are both agreeing to it.
take him to trail if he doesn't reslond.
please remain with them if they are enjoying themselves.
i got married a few months before turning 21, and then immediately became pregnant.
it cannot be very much considering that you cheated.
it seems that you only care about yourself.
it's because being with a stranger at night could lead to an std in the morning.
you two can be mutual acquaintances.
why break up with him when he is a good man?
it seems as though you are.
tell him that you can just be friends.
he is an exemplary man otherwise, so i will not entertain suggestions that we should part ways.
perhaps you should tell him that he is a wonderful man but unfortunately you do not see him that way.
it isn't something that can be done quickly.
women like to wait for one special man, while men like to have as many women that they can.
it appears that you are pondering whether love and kindness exists.
recognize how lucky you are that someone finds you so special.
unusual men seem to be drawn to unhealthy, codependent relationships.
how does one get a man you are interested in to ask you on a date without having to ask him first?
you have to stop it as it starts.
be patient, it is the best recourse.
be resonsible, relax, and allow him to prove to you that he is what he claims to be.  gl.
why not steal a kiss and see what transpires!
if he is worth keeping, the next time she flirts with him, he will tell her he is not interested.
do not worry, he is out there, not too far from you now.

the right one will come along.
because i am a guy, yes, kiss the girls, make out with them, it is normal.
then, once you have thought about it, make your decision.

or something really special that we can do.
do not talk to him until he talks to you.

it's not just girls who feel that way about guys.
i say that looks change, go for personality first.
be yourself and joke, smile and laugh.

fight for it if you want.
you shouldn't put yourself in situations like that.

if you are unsuccessful with that approach, consider trying something different.
would you like to have him over for dinner?
he is having trouble determining his life's direction.
as a woman, i do not feel comfortable having a man walk behind me.
time may shed some light on her less appealing qualities.
if you're in love with him, then you should feel devastated. however, i guess you're not in love with him because you're asking me this.

you are in bed with a man and you are on a completely different subject...
many men falsely believe that insecurity in their partner is the blame for all relationship issues.
the problem could be that he just does not like her.
if you are interested in the person, don't hesitant to let them know.
he's doesn't communicate with me much anymore, and i don't know how to better the situation. please help.
if he does not comply then part ways.
how deep is your pain?
she loves playing with guys feelings.
sex should only be between husband and wife.
i agree those people are normal.
on the other hand, if they are not, then you can get rid of them.
how much did she hurt you?
i love to torture guys, i say laughing.
even if the sex is consensual, then it is still rape.
if you go to places that have normal people, the answer is yes, of course.
ughh, it's so annoyoing and stressful.
you should really think about what your doing!
a lot of guys like quiet girls as they get get older.
with the love of my life!
so i would pick the geeks. hell, i have always picked the geeks.
do you always get to have it?
for ten dollars one time, and another time we walked along the beach for free.
if it only involves you two liking each other then you should avoid it.
you don't need to rush into a serious relationship, enjoy your youth.
i'm concerned that he will think i do not care for him at all.
i think that the city os ok.
maybe you should just continue being friends.
be yourself and do not try to be somebody else.
i hope next time you will find your mr. right.
how old are you, by the way?
you should learn how to spell the word impress.
if the truth is what you want.
regardless of what happens, do not allude to the situation.
do you have any idea why he acts so distantly towards you?
it is good that he desires you for more than just one thing.
it wasn't fate that introduced you to this man.
with all due respect, you're emitting an odor.
i'll pass. there are too many sharks.
it would be a good idea to accompany her to her locker.
you can try a variety of oils and waxes. maybe consider icy hot, but be careful where you apply it.

many brides will say they prefer a small wedding.
they usually don't want to be with one girl for a while.
it matters how he acts in general.
if you really love him, don't tell him what he can't see.
that is why in malaysii we do not recommend marriage under the recommended age.
those ladies ought to be dismissed as they are a group of promiscuous women with needless actions to execute.
my male companion, who genuinely favors me, will be at my abode in less than twenty minutes.
please do not permit a group of young women to influence you merely so that you are accepted. good luck, blueladybug.
so, you are similar to a young woman being used to be unfaithful on another woman?
there is more to it than cooking and cleaning.
it left me wondering, was it with the right person?
i have the same probelm, thanks for asking that question.
we should both be careful so neither of us get hurt or caught, good luck.
the determining factor will be your relationship with old friends, new friends or classmates.
it is important that males inquire about this subject.
inquire as this will reveal whether she is genuine or superficial.
tracey, you are more mature than you think you are.
in my opinion, males are mean-spirited.
meanwhile, the man returns to his wife as she is courteous with his possessions.
i cannot see myself being with anyone other than you.
love does not judge with the eyes.
in truth, the others are not stupid, but they appear that way because their knowledge is less than ours.
if i could burn 400 calories in ten minutes, i would be absolutely exhausted as well.
the earth is round and the internet is a huge craze.
i also don't have any girlfriend, so i think we can be friends.
it should be when you feel like doing it.
people want to meet just to have sex, but sometimes it leads to serious problems so be careful.
do not do it just because the sex is good.
nasty diseases that will destroy your anus.
what do think his motive is?
seek advice from god.
give her a yorkie for her birthday.
i spoke with someone about god.
faithful christian friends are the best friends to have.
why would you think he intends to do that?
so you must be more than slightly intelligent.
give her a nice present for her birthday or special day.
i would have told someone.
men need time to be alone or spend with their friends.
boys come and go, but friends are forever.
what came fist the chicken or the egg?
are you glutton for punishment?
good luck finding the right guy!
any one else with mental problems is in a hospital.
cleanliness will be very helpful, and the two of you can work out some other helpful things.
i'd say about 21 or 22.
how can you determine if you are in love or just infatuated with someone?
you need to make yourself known so others will notice you.

what should i do if i date someone that smells like onions?
why not ask your girlfriend?
send your kids to alateen.
i do not need to read any additional answers.
should i give him an opportunity?
good luck, young lady; these things are difficult to manage.
some men learn differently as they grow older; however, many do not.
if you were his girlfriend, and another woman tried to break up your relationship, would you want such a thing to happen?
please put a bag over your face.
but if it were the things of dreams, he would not cheat.
what would we have done then?
i bet you say that to all the boys.
good question, i never thought of that.
it's not that he doesn't love you, he just needs some time alone.
romantically speaking, i have many options.
no, use another reason because that one will emotionally damage her.
they will probably discuss math.
you just need to take it one day at a time.
if you have to ask, then the answer is yes.
what matters is the man's attitude and his sexual performance.
i'm sorry,  but this is a yahoo answer site not a matchmaking site.
should i tell my cousin that her boyfriend was kissing my friend?
you simply cannot. i found that out myself.
say sorry because everyone makes mistakes including me.
please pay me and thank you for answering my question.
there is always another man out there.
it is a matter of testicles because they produce sperm nonstop.
there are good men left in the world.
i will answer this question for you.
mcdonals, burger king, whataburger, wendy's, checker's, and the movies for example.
i did not notice that you admitted to cheating on your wife.
you need to ensure that you are safe and that she does not have a reason to sue you.
that is the word women always throw around.
you have to actually do something about it!
it is okay to talk about things.
too much make-up isn't appealing.
if you can't stop thinking about her, you like her.
you have to do what is best for you.
to get her to do what you want her to do, you will need to threaten her.
you get excited when you talk about him.
i am a single woman.
just because he says it, doesn't mean that he loves you.
i hope that you get it resolved.
tell her that you were not in possession of your faculties when it occurred.
the definition of abusive includes verbal, emotional or pschologoical - not just physical.
i suggest that you enjoy high school while you can.
i sorry but not many of the girls have their photos.

do not ignore her and just pass by.
good luck and do not do this.
you are going to have to play cat and mouse with this situation.
i had one deleted for adult content because i said sex like six.
if i had feelings for her i would reciprocate and show them.
when you are thinking about cheating on your spouse remember that others might be thinking about cheating with your spouse.
is your marriage the root cause of why you were cheating?
i think he was interested mainly because girls have difficulty selecting the right man for them.
everybody has their preference in significant others and i personally prefer individuals with a darker skin.
how could you cheat on your wife and then ruin your girlfriend's life?
he continually states that life is long but i see it from the opposite perspective.
it would be wonderful to have a swing like that in my backyard.
i'd prefer to meet you first, and then i'll decide.
you men on here may want to reconsider your questions and answers!
i consider myself to be the most mature out of my friends who are also twenty-one (i believe).
should people be married to have sex?
give her the opportunity to explain whether or not she does.
is sex after marriage and old idea?
i was not very mature at age twenty-one.
people definitely have to be married in order to have sex.
allow her to give you an explanation.
sex after marriage is god's law.
with romance sometimes comes love, but with love there should always be great romance.
i am in general, doing pretty well, it is just i feel weird about telling people.
you know your best move is to ask him what's going on?
as close as she feels comfortable with.
do not come out and say i am in love with you and i want to have sex with you.
you know you are really in love.
is it okay to date younger men?
there is a very big difference.
you might not know of someone that will be there.
as you mentioned, your former girlfriend married a 65 year old for his wealth.
accompany her as she walks to her to her locker or something similar.
first, it is difficult to find sincere friendships in the present.
men like women who initiate things.
no, nebbish people would bore me.
just tell yourself, i know he loves me and i know i love him.
if you ask him out and he says no, don't let it bother you.
that's all you need to do!
what is she using the money for? herself?
do you think it will be possible to change their minds?
are you interested in giving her, or him, a phone call?
i have been in my current relationship for six years.
men, are you aware of the time every  month during a women's menstrual cycle when she isn't interested in sex?
wow, that is a really difficult spot you are stuck in.
it sounds as if you and the person who wants to only be my friend should hook up.
i am a 23 year old man and in need of help.
you would both be happier if you eliminated him from your life.

yes, not physically, but mentally.
you are cheating on your wife, and ruining your girlfriends life as well.
what was the return address?
whenever you become interested in someone at age twelve or somewhere.
a vacation for the two of you alone.
the majority of domestic abusers will not assault a man.
do not be concerned, though, the right man will come along and like you for more than your appearance.
it is best to go after another guy.
it depends on the girl getting the ring.
he will call you later.
i think of kissing a girl, but cannot do it in real life.
men and women are different people.
if you do not know what i mean just skip all of that.
god made them that way so that we men would have something to post on yahoo answers.
for example, well over three years ago my friend had a big argument with someone by boyfriend knew.
i also wonder about the same thing sister.
i think you should take some time to think about it even if it is just a trip around the block to clear your head.
that is something that is just against your personal beliefs.
this might become the greatest relationship you have ever experienced.
are you implying what i think you are trying to tell me?
you should call him using a calling card.
you go girl! forget about that jerk.
wait until somebody else tells you.
does a guy that you have sex with really love you?
don't worry, if he is interested he will call.
but, if she says she's going to kill herself, don't believe her!
you already gave it up to that guy. what was his name- back in high school?
sometimes, that works great.
keep in mind that you two are siblings, and that can never change.
buy him something that you will wear from victorias secret.
if he is being to sensitive then doing that, is pretty messed up.
if you love someone, wouldn't you want them to be happy?
leave as soon as you can.
i would advise you to be cautious.
that is the worst thing you could ever do.
it is all about conversation.
keep looking; he is probably a cheater.
go and hang out, hear some nice free music or poetry, and get ourself a cup of coffee and introduce yourself.
the sad this is most guys are jerks. and pretty much are after an easy girl somes along.
what do you do when you have a friend that is a girl, but you want to make it more?
you need to seriously talk to your husband.
in march of last year, he lived in a 3 bedroom apartment.
you can not stop thinking about this person, becasue they are always on your mind.
i have a question about him. it is: does chris woody really like me?
some people have fetishes and they deserve to have them fullfilled.
the answer is not a or b but instead the correct answer is e and z.
you will have to decide what direction you want to go forward.
i feel that that man likes to play the field and see multiple women at once.
the reason you want to emulate those people is because you see that they get a lot of attention and you would like that same attention focused on you.
you should continue shopping until you find a pair that fits you properly.
but if she does not, then you will know.
are twenty-three year old men immature?
yes, what are you waiting for? go acquire it.
all answers to life's questions will be discovered, given time.
love and lust are not synonyms.
it's time to get off the computer, get out and find a job.
once all the women that are getting implants and face injections get to be in their seventies they won't look very pretty anymore.
he cares about my children and is supportive, that makes me love him and want to be in a relationship with him.
i can't be without god, i need him more each day.
if you don't you'll always wonder what would have been.
love is when you care, protect, listen, get along with, and like a person.
i can chat online if you are lonesome.
it also depends on you. i am jealous and would not want to to say "been there, done that."
if you like him, do it!
there is a word i am looking for and do not see, called 'monogomous.'
the new significant male other will complete the task so you do not have to.
if you have strong romantic feelings towards him, you should have the ability to overlook this problem and love him for the person he is.
no. do not complete that activity unless she is a completely disrespectful or repulsive woman.
it is my personal preference to enjoy being committed to someone.  living out of a relationship is not good or bad, but i think that there is much more to do as a couple rather than a single individual.
i felt like i was wandering without aim, and i was not sure whether or not i am on the right path towards my goals.
stop discussing the issue and tell him.
disregard previous sentiments as i do not desire to know the answer.
if you truly loved your boyfriend you would not require any other romantic partners.
give this due consideration then be honest in your own thoughts.
subsequently, act in a manner recommended by people with no wisdom and allow him to have sexual access when he requests it.
keep company with people who truly care and love you.
find someone who will always be there for you.
i thought i was the only one who liked this.
it's about equal, some enjoy it but some do not.
tell your husband if she likes her. good luck.

it is a very cruel world.
you should have sex only with a person you love!
if yes then she is promiscuous!
they are locked in her car.
i am close with a boy but just and friends.
it would seem you truly want to wait.
you need to know that you can make it.
on my wedding day it rained, but i would not change that either.
find a nice pet and some friends.
remove all of your clothing, push him onto the bed, and have coitus with him.
share a secret and see how far it goes.
you do not want to spend your life asking yourself "what if?".
hmmm why did you not tell him you had a date and he is not invited.
act composed, but not goofy and composed.
men today like women who are assertive.
if you have any doubt, leave!
personally, i think you are in love.
i knew that he was the man that i had drempt about, about one year prior.
my husband always keeps himself well groomed: he smells good; has no nose hairs; and keeps his hair trimmed, washed and combed.
if both are alright with it, then it is acceptable to live la vida loca.
male order bride: allow them to proceed with the wedding then.
if there was no sin, why did christ die on the cross for us?
he tells me that he loves me and wants to be in a relationship, but he doesn't act like he loves me.
being a man, i should therefore know.
disregard traditional dating, women are asking out men more often every day.
my husband has obsessive compulsive disorder and he does actions such as checking the locks, and doing this multiple times.
the next time, it could mean prison time for him, and you too.
yes, from what i have heard they do.
i do prefer bigger girls and i do prefer brunettes.
i told the guy i liked that my friend liked him, but really she does not.
look at yahoo people finder, name data, or google.
it doesn't matter how far you want to advance.
you're looking for someone to tell you what you did was acceptable.
no i haven't had any dreams similar to that.
usually after they are thinking about the first person they were intimate with.
what game are you playing?
i have heard they are more well endowed than asian men are.
i do not doubt that you have some good reasons.
you should find an attractive woman with whom to become sexually involved.
i am usually drawn to shorter men, although i prefer men who are somewhat taller than i am.
a companion of mine even had their wedding.
i am surprised that you and he are already cohabitating.
intercourse between a man and his wife is not adultery.
things will improve once you begin spending time together.
it then felt inappropriate and i began to feel ill.
for every choice, this was something i did right.
it is all over, do not be afraid to talk about it.
can their love go deeper then that?
do not ruin something that you fought for so hard.
you said he had moved on immediately.
tell him that he lost his chance.
i think if you smiled more you would be beautiful.
try to start another relationship with him.
don't tell them where you are moving.
i will try to follow that.
right now i am living with my parents.
no, she is not a friend, unless you had already told her that is was okay.
stay. if they're your soulmate then love would be all that matters.
treasure your family and all that you have now! an argument is just dust compared to the whole universe!
yes, respect her as a sister and set aside that fight so that she can be happy.
i assume it is because all women are cheaters as well.
go to the lewis store and buy him some fascinating jeans.
you can always see if he knows.
i have never had one, well in a round about way when i was eleven, but not really.
women should tell men what they enjoy and all of the men want to know, trust me.
if flirting doesn't work, find someone who is interested in you.
women say things very rude as if they were talking to their little brother.
blonde, fair skin, blue eyes, and small frame.
make friends here or gain some knowledge from the chatroom.
you don't want to get hurt.
definitely, spend time with the man you are genuinely interested in.
try picturing the individual stuck with you for every single minute of every single day until you decease.
my wife is a plus size woman and does not have an easy temperament.
income is scarce and there are children involved.
try to rebuild yourself afterwards. it is so tragic!
$350 is quite a lot to spend on a boyfriend of less than a year.
i have heard many different opinions.
some will rush things along in order to have a child that may or may not be yours.
good personality and sense of humor.
of course, it happens to me all the time.
he is waiting 1 more year in order to avoid jailtime.
some people do not want to be alone.
you buy dinner this time and next time they will.
you should meet someone that does not go to the bar.
if you do not comply it has problems written all over it.
when you flatulate, what is the cause of the moisture?
how old are you? it is very immature to ask that.
yes, certainly, this is a way to demonstrate that he enjoyed sex that was had.
in my opinion, you ought to discontinue the practice of asphyxiation.
i have many friends, both male and female.
i don't like you so try your luck with another girl.
i was kind of looking for someone too.

i am 30 years old and am interested in dating a younger man around the ages 23 to 25 years old.
he may be a complete insane person!
in the event, that you are both single there may be a chance that you both may be interested in one another again.
the man proposes to the woman and the woman's response is to tell him that she does not have feelings towards him.
try joining a book club or another similar club.
i believed my boyfriend when he said he loved me.
if he is unattached, and you are attracted to him, what is stopping you from pursuing a possible relationship?
if you feel that a potential marriage will not last, why would you entertain the idea of marriage in the first place?
take an educated guess about why we have been assigned names.
you need to be wary of male high school students.
i hope i helped you and you do well.
her parent's large, sit down shower.
let your heart lead you.
if he behaves like you have hiv, understand?
he would wait also, if he did that.
if your friend has ever shown jealousy, she could possibly be making an effort to end your relationship.
i can tell that you are deep in thought. what do you know?
i would never do anything to steer you in the wrong direction. i wish you nothing, but good luck.
you should ask him what type of relationship he is interested in pursuing because you are receiving nothing but mixed signals from him.
that is a once in a lifetime opportunity!
i do not understand what you mean by mistreat.
there always has to be good communication; never stop talking to one another even if you are upset.
you should be receiving signals if she is into you.
communication is one of the things that brought you together, so use it to keep you together.
first, you need to check their identity.
i wish you luck.
being sensitive is just expressing your feelings.
is that what is best for your children?
in lieu of generalizing, some men continue to have decency.
if you split her chest cavity open, you will find it.
live in the moment, thinking only of her.
please let me know when you find out.
yes, always be honest, despite the circumstances.
no, there is nothing wrong; it is an inherited trait.
there are quite a few attractive men here!
i followed my instincts and i was correct. it will all come out!
i believe rose16 is correct, but it is good to love everyone.
my girlfriend said she would trust me, and i was never unfaithful again.
i am not sure, but i think you should wait at least a few weeks.
i never bring anyone to meet my daughter.
it depends.  if you are still friends, then discuss it.
i think it may be 16 or 17 for girls, 18 or 19 for boys.
as a man, ask yourself, "what was your first real toy"?
if she hesitates, leave her and forget about the guy you admire.
koffee, i've always said, i trust my gut over what i hear, see, or read.
you can if you choose to, but you must face the consequences of your actions.
i want more than a crush, so what do i do from here?
be prepared for him to go somewhere else.
thank you for stereotyping, ladies.
sometimes, i'd rather reminisce with males as opposed to females because they're more masculine.
he's always trying to get near you.
if a man has an issue with his spouse or significant other.
i wonder the same thing, some men ignore how women feel.
i don't understand why it is such a big thing for men to say this to a woman.
i am certain he would do the same for you.
you should let him spend time getting to know you
you should give small and simple surprise gifts.
guys have no interest in fancy restaurants that charge astronomical rates for a plate of food.
i know of a website that may be of some assistance, it is not religious and offers great advice.
please use proper english as well as proper grammar, it is possible.
that is affirmative as long as the gentleman is not.
the solution is simple, just wait until they ask you for it. it should happen well after you first meet but long before the relationship ends.
it sounds nice, but that shy man is interested in you.
if she enjoyed her time with this man, then maybe you should leaver her be and be happy for her.
i see it at work, in the streets. why is that?
but if she starts justifying it, what then?
i would converse with him and inform him what you appreciate and what you do not.
i desired her for my possession, but she did not envision me as such and i was aware of it.
if you are with a woman who also appreciates it, then proceed!
you will not know unless you try.
show that you really care about that person.
it is acceptable if you are a male and married.
i read that approximately 6.5 is correct.
do not procrastinate, however.
yes, i did that once. i now wish that i would have said yes to him.
you approach her by walking up to her.
when you are in love, you want to give as much as you possibly can - and have no interest in taking.
now that i have said this, i have dated a quiet girl who was wonderful to be with.
this will ruin your wife's life.
i have already succeeded a bit.
i certainly do not think it is okay for her to secretly have those friends behind your back.
i agree with most, but not all, of the comments here. there has to be something more to it.
and you do not want that.
if you want, and it happens to him, i don't know what you should do.
i am attracted to any girl that is pretty.
i am positive she would understand.
men like it that's why. i have inappropriate thoughts.
if you love each other, and are grounded you will get through this.
years ago i had a gentleman friend who was very free with sexual relations.
you should sit him down for a talk, without even mentioning his past relationships.
it is something only you can do when you decide to change your life.
yes but do not expect the financial responsibility to fall on my shoulders.
you should show him youre the boss and demand he keep his distance from her.
is it the same with men?
if that is what you like, then attempt it.
nothing bad will come from making the attempt. if it does not work, then you can always move past it.
i enjoy those kinds of dreams.
it has to be, "you are so pleasant to look upon that i would drink a tub full of your bath water."
she closed her eyes and wanted you to do the same.
it's too late for them.
if we didn't do so, it would be very confusing.
i am pleased that i am not in your situation.
the situation depends on the guy and the shyness of the girl.
if you loved him, you would not think that he was ugly.
georgio, you are surely a ladies' man.
i am single, and the only guys in my school who like me are quite distasteful.
fragment....the best man i will ever have in this life...
unless you have a reason, you should take any way available to get out.
resilient men tend to achieve promotion.
she inquires whether i am faithful?
it is important that you are able to relax, as that is an inadvisable time to become tense.
knowing your partner well is also a must: what is their motivation, how do they spend their time, and so on.
you should marry him if he is in the military.
if you love him, you will try.
yes, and this moment will be one i do not forget in my life.
but that has nothing to do with the question.
gross, please let the name be a pseudonym and he is not a real preacher.
what is nicer? real or fake breasts?
incorrect because is will definitely cause trouble in your relationship.
american men are seen as more powerful.
it is dangerous to get implants.
do not do anything to jeopardize your relationship.
america is a powerful country altogether.
if needed, you shouldn't hesitate to use lubricant for sexual intercourse.
do you believe that shy women and men can date?
men enjoy being told how to pleasure a woman.
you should refrain from any rash behavior that may make him turn away from you.
all you need to do is trust and love her.
even when you have it in your mouth, move your tongue.
if she admits she likes someone else that means she is shopping.
not in my viewpoint because some people are really attractive with their weight.
twenty-eight to thirty-four age range  i am looking for, but they are either really young, or really old.
then walk up to him and introduce yourself.
i admit, though, that many of my friends have done so.
i see you do not plan to have sexual intercourse, but plans sometimes go awry.
aren't preachers supposed to be held to a higher moral standard?
currently, i must express my feelings to someone important so i don't hurt them.
of course, it is acceptable to have male friends.
it is great now to be married with no ill feelings.
large brown eyes are cute.
some girls are shy regardless of their appearance.
it is my belief that he has a big problem.
i'm relieved to be in love and happy that i have no desire for even the most attractive of men.
i'm not really enjoying the course i am taking.
you'll be left with nothing but doubt.
sometimes what you think is love, is just a fling.
it has to do with how men are raised.
you said you're a christian.
love is what people make of it.
i tried sports, but to no use.
i am a beach bum from florida, and can spot a blonde amongst a sea of women.
it is easier to tell when he is not.
most men have desires, but sometimes it is deeper than you think.
how do i become more attractive to the handsome, kind guys?
stay occupied, go out with some friends and have a good time.
it is not an issue, it is fantastic!
it is like i am leaving to join the marines.
begin with just the tip, and then proceed further.
after trying it once, many women really enjoy it.
if he continues to have a problem answering, i don't know what to add besides wishing you good luck!
do you realize that it is wrong to be in love with your family member?
should you really wear something bright?
my favorite is one coupon for a quick bout of coitus.
my cousins are cute but i am not attracted to them.
and please do not say both.
it is merely your jealousy showing.
dishonor by marriage would be good for me. yes, be abstinent until marriage.
i wonder if i will ever find the woman for me.
how can you tell someone you love him when he believes love does not exist?
women are sensitive creatures, and that is something that we cannot change.
it was shocking to find the word "boobs" in his google search history.
would you care if i asked you a few questions regarding the avatar?
why attempt to love someone that cannot reciprocate those feelings?
i may just be saying that because it is friday and i do not have a date.
how would you feel if you saw her with another man?
now help him get over his past relationship.
it suddenly becomes about them, and not about you.
move your television to your bedroom.
i hope it goes well.
i have no idea; ask him in a letter.
if you love him, why ruin a good situation?
my friend has been nice to me and my niece.
finally, i confessed and we worked it out.
that is the first time that i've had a dream like that.
i wish, since i miss them very much!
i am a guy, so i cannot tell you much.
if he loved you, he will not be able to move on that quickly.
just ask her what does she feel?
what is it good for?
you should part on good terms and pursue her sister seperately. maybe she will be into a three-way with her sister.
if you get him damp, you have to do something to get him dry again.
i still can not eat steak following the surgery. and i can not wait untill i am allowed to.
you will get bonus pity points that way.
you will know he trusts you if he shares his thoughts, fears, and important things about himself.
though i am not a woman, i say get away from that situation quickly.
though it depends on a number of factors, the most important factor is genetics.
if you continually give, but receive nothing in return, eventually you will end up with nothing left to give.
physical appearance is the first thing you observe.
walk away, it is not worth it, it sounds like a terrible situation about to happen.
i do not want to just pick one, but if i have to it has got to be the woman's butt.
did you see the ring kobe purchased for his wife?
hmmm, let us see. so many to choose from.
i was attracted to this hot girl i met.
email me and tell me about yourself.
blessings to you!
i want a biblical answer.
send him photos of rob and george.
i hope you have a lot of luck.
please,just give me your best advice.
send me a photo of robbie williams and george michael.
while crying,i told him i was going to run away and kill myself,however it worked.
good luck in the future, since you had bad luck meeting one of them already.
marriage is a significant event in a person's life.
somone who actually loves you will show they care by being loyal and faithful since the start of the relationship.
i would hit her twice actually.
because they actually show us otherwise.
let me know some ways in which i would go about that.
that is a friends-but-attracted relationship. ask him if that is what he wants.
give me your telephone number and i will call you.
i am seeking a friend, too.
even if it hurts me, and he is aware of it?
a ring is not going to prove that.
she says nothing happened, but she also said to not assume he would not do something like that.
on a man, my favorite body part is his back side.
how do you feel about this new man?
i hope that helps.
she likes to tease.
no, i am not. yes, i am.
flirting can be lots of fun, but be prepared for a responce.
be careful for sure.
i want someone who is looking for the same thing.
and act very unpleasantly to people whose attention you are not interested in.
a man would do what you allow him to.
most men will not cheat on you.
in the first place, you are not a "playa." you are sad, and asking a ridiculous question.
yes, i do believe that. i have never met him, though.
the best thing that i can tell you is to marry an american man.
where are all of the good men employed?
we should communicate less via phone and instant message. that way there will be more to talk about in person.
i guess that would depend on the man.
if you truly value the friendship, i would not change the status quo.
friendship should never be the issue.
it is aware of the danger it faces.
contact me at justin hook, 18701 old highway 66, pacific, mo 62069.
both men and women are eligible.
the above post says everything i would like to say and so much more.
is it okay for me to move forward or that seem too desperate on my part?
if you're willing to put the time and effort into a relationship you can always succeed.
that woman is very attractive and she knows it and uses it well to her advantage.
i am a cheerleader but i am also a complex individual on multiple other levels.
promiscuity ruins reputations.  whatever you do, though, have fun and enjoy life!
if you truly do love him, love always deserves a second chance.
i am looking for a real relationship, but i do not live near you.
it is because men like you cause us to hold you accountable, and this makes you feel as though women are not worth it.
have you ever told your friend that you like him?
where can i find a free, printable marriage contract online?
listen to her feelings and always be honest.
i would do anything for this woman and her children.
i was explaining that to someone today.
you need to let it go if you did not leave him five years ago.
it is due to high content of fat and cholesterol.
i think it is just their way of saying, "i have traveled, so i know!"
would you like to accompany us?
what would you consider to be blind love?
you should gift-wrap whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and a blind fold.
he is likely fond of you, but is too intimidated to approach you.
it is because i do not know you.
if you have feelings for him then you should not risk the relationship.
this is due to the fact that you and the other person are not having the same thing.
i have arrived home. also, i think the cemetary is inappropriate.
i am not sure what you mean by that question but it will be deleted.
it is an idea held by many people that marriage is nothing but a trap of responsibilities.
love is more than just a word to say-it is the very air that we breathe.
despite the fact that he is doing well, it is rape.
if both you and he understand the parameters of the relationship, then move forward.
you need to tell her that the circumstances aren't agreeable with you.
i received a phone call the following day.
it will give you a lengthier amount of time to get to know a person and evaluate how much you like them.
make it clear to him that the two of you are exclusive.
don't intrude!  he will let you know if he is still interested.  good luck.
you will actually ask the questions here.
explain your feeling to her, man!
there is no good reason for anyone to be drunk.
you must be over four feet tall in order for me to be interested in you.
ask him out or wait for him to work up the nerves to ask you out on a date.
have a nice day!
can you trust the man?
employ a friend to inquire if he is attracted to you.
do you respect someone because you love them or do you love them because you respect them?
the male i am attracted to also stares at me often.
as long as the wedding gift is fitting, the cost is irrelevant.
men are unable to be alone for one month, while females can withstand it.
i chatted with her for a few days and the gave her your phone number.
would you ever consider dating the opposition, the enemy?
throw that away, didn't your parents teach you not to take candy from strangers!
honesty, humor and freedom that is the space between us.
if you were ever entitled to that, you definitely gave it up after the divorce.
i can not guarantee the accuracy.
did they have sex on the first date?
do you want to ask me out?
that is what happened to me.
we are in our mid 50s and we can say that it gets better with age.
under what circumstances would you give up your life for someone if they asked you to?
then he is not ready to kiss you.
if it doesn't work out between you, who will you go to next - his father?
someone is going to get hurt here.
when you find him, let me know if he has a brother.
stop being so squeamish and do it already.
i would recommend trying some humor with him.
my dad worries about me too much.
it is wrong but not to the person you are speaking to.
please respond, i want to say happy new year to you!
if have a death wish you can tell them.
he either likes you or you body.
i am sure the lord has another partner in mind.
do not make impulsive decisions when you are angry.
please kiss me on the cheek.
i am in love but i am very afraid that the other person is not.
first you buy a round of drinks and then they do.
be creative and do all types of sweet little things for her.
the floor is great, yet the stairs is a good challenge.
i already have a daughter. she's intelligent and confident.
they're securing their love. perhaps, it needed to be done?
i'm fifthteen. i never been in a foster home.
you must reassure him. he's acting like that because he fears losing you.
follow your instinct because it is normally accurate.
men who do not reveal any emotion seem too cold; and women appreciate gentle, kind, sensitive, and emotive men.
it is not strange or sexy; it is just you.
i believe they become shy around them.
from what i have read here: you love him, and he reciprocates the feeling; you want to become married.
i believe white men and asian women go together nicely.
he has changed his ways, you have witnessed these changes.
nevertheless she puts that boy before me.
furthermore, some women are highly stressed which makes it quite difficult to com.  note: i do not understand the last word (com)
i enjoy the large knocks.
you never know until you experience it yourself.
she was not faithful to her husband the first couple of months.
i have been listening and the story has not changed.
keep in mind the answers to the questions.
do not live in the past.
it is much different to live the situation.
i was unfaithful to my current husband for the first three months of our relationship.
i have been waiting, but the answer is the same.
you must ask her what her preferences are, and you must remember what she says.
you must not dwell on past events.
remember this, men don't mature until they are at least 35.
if he asked and you said no, think about your reasons for saying no.
you are bisexual, does that mean you like men as well?
there is no day without night, no wrong without right.
have a conversation with some girlfriends about this.
will you have to go smoothly?
do not attempt to find a boyfriend online.
if you really care for her much then you must continue to pursue her.
i did, as did many of my friends.
i regret to inform you that it is because their boyfriends request it of them.
well, i do not think that the majority of men are afraid of women.
the best advice i can give you is to breathe and not dwell on it.
try going out with your friend's friends, and bring your friends along as well.
you cannot simply decide what features they should come with.
i cannot find anything but black sleeveless dresses. is this acceptable?
wait to see what he thinks.
go out and find one.
start acting like you do not care. it drives women crazy.
if you are a man and not married to the woman, then it is bad.
i have not cheated on him since.
he will have a link on his webpage that you can investigate.
if i were you, i would be concerned about the way tyler is acting.
inform him that you are repulsed by his behavior, and ignore him.
this makes me question the size of he penis.
my favorite aspects of a woman are her legs, behind, and waist.
it is so much easier to walk away if it does not work out.
just ask him yourself.
you simply must proceed with caution.
you battered the man she commited adultery with and then you spit in her face.
also, you do not have to be concerned about getting cold!
in any case, my advice is to ask him.
we aren't the ones who are bad, you are. i'm just joking, you should watch less television.
it is because you love someone too much.
you need to be sure to use a lot of lubricant.
even though the color can change on a daily basis, it doesn't prove anything.
there's only one way and that's the straight and narrow.
you are really in love.
pour the proper amount of oil in your car.
what does it mean when it changes colors?
i prefer thickness with length, but if it is not available i can make it work.
i have tattooed my tongue and a ring.
in that case i would split the money with her.
senior year:  one fine day she walked to my locker.
choose something that would be special to both of you.
she was on the stage to receive her diploma.
speak to the prison chaplain, if you are able.
however, the ones that do choose to do so for three reasons. first, because they believe caucasian men have money.
do not do anything. it may make the outcome worse.
being a virgin does not make anyone sexy or odd.
after more time passes, you will be able to ignore his obsessive tendencies.
i am unsure what to do regarding this situation.
or is he irresponsible and disloyal?
you should spend time with your family and friends, experience joy in other ways.
it all depends on how old you are.
currently he is often interacting with me, though not as a friend would.
there are many types of girls. some are a good match for you, while others are not.
that is the type of man that you should desire.
does he demonstrate his affection for you?
what ages do you consider to be those of a teenager?
you see i was trying to convince a woman of that..
sure i do believe in love, i also do believe in as cancel as well.
shauna grant was very beautiful, yet what a terrible tragedy!
its more likely lust than anything else.
what an unintelligent question! is that truthful enough for you?
there are many ill people in the world.
take note that you do not need him in order to divorce him.
end that. end your relationship immediately and start a relationship with successful and wealthy man.
i agree with paul67337 and award him ten points. i wish that my boyfriend were that romantic. it is sad.
i was not aware that there is a yahoo! lottery.
newer questions receive more activity on yahoo!
but if she did not, then why not go for it first?
can you tell me how to distinguish between a sexy and a normal woman?
the reason is you have not explored your sexuality.
i prefer tall since i am tall.
it is just the way that you are.
my husband and i have been married for almost one year, and we engage in sexual activity at least once per day.
perhaps it would benefit you to start spending time with a different type of woman.
she looks too young to be your mother.
go to the church picnic and have fun.
she's wise for her age.
he is my soul mate.
his girlfriend left him.
she is your mother and not a way to become a millionaire.
yes, there is a such thing, but have fun.
i am sure she is mature for her age.
do what she likes and be near her soul.
my ex left me for my roommate.
i suggest going to the doctor even if you feel all right.
if you find him staring at you again, ask him a pointed question.
it appears that you do not love him.
no way! i have brunette hair and lots of fun!
you should say, "hello", and then smile at her.
women have better control than men.
some men look well in red, others in black.
to be perfectly clear, this relationship is over.
maybe it is because he is attractive.
do not be in a relationship with her if she kisses another woman when she is with you.
i hope i may have helped a bit.
your man must accept the fact that you have friends that are male.  does he not have any female friends?
avoid thinking of this person.
very true, only girls mature.
i was informed it was five to seven inches of african hair.
they went with their church friends.
why do some women get attached to men that do not care about them?
many guys do not like quiet girls.
they are constantly in view.
from what i have read, the measure is five to seven inches.
by themselves or by so-called cool acquaintances.
why do women in relationships get so attached, whereas men do not care at all?
many men believe that quiet, innocent women are merely snobbish.
always standing there when i look behind me.
that is not why i love them.
it depends on whether you like your crushes crew.
you should ask corey.
after you are satisfied, remember to prioritize your partners needs as well.
what makes me the "best man" she has ever known?
if this was about what he wanted, then you would not be breaking up him.  you would be his slave.
he is everything that i have ever wanted in a man.
most likely they know this and it is why they are so introverted.
otherwise it would be acceptable to lie, steal, cheat and murder and...well, you understand.
if you do like her immensely, you will tell her without worry.  if you do not tell her, how will you otherwise know?
he was in love with me long ago.
that is completely untrue.
the right one will come along.
i cannot wrap my brain around why they do that.
i am twenty six years old and considering dating a younger man who is twenty three
you simply need more strong emotions and then you will know when the time is right.
yes, he will constantly bother you and smile or make strange faces at you.
hire an assassin to murder her. i am merely joking.
i had not believed that until i fell in love with a man i had never seen.
try a retirement home. possibly you could acquire a job at one since you are lazy.
considering her sense of humor, do you want it to be fun?
are you sharing your bed with someone else?
first of all, was she aware that you liked him?
afterwards, i got a new personal computer.
"i wish i did too," i cried as i thought to myself.
i'm not convinced that it's going to work.
you'llo probably need practice, but i hope that this helps.
not only will you lose your romantic relationship, but you'll also lose a friend if the relationship doesn't work out.
a lot of christians only get married to engage in sexual intercourse.
you will be able to focus more on verbal communication if you don't masturbate as much.
allow me to say that they are not all like that.
if you enjoy sexual intercourse, then don't get married!
there are some honest men who are not cheaters, but it does require you to keep looking.
if you are ready to move on, ave, i am here for you.
this is just the quote of it.
it is acceptable if it is your wife.
he continued to call her and lie.
i am still interested in my ex-boyfriend that i reside with.
the keys are honesty, compassion, listenening and a good shoulder to lean on.
i hope that your relationship works out. good luck!
males are not smart. this is the main thing that you should be aware of.
yes, this is a trick question.
i've been married for three years.
men like it when the woman makes the first move.
that first group works very hard making sure that you focus on your inner self.
listen ladies, not all men are honest, like promiscuous women, so, i do not know why you all automatically think that.
even if she is not dating nor married, if she is involved with someone, that would make her a cheat too!
do not be foolish enough to try and buy their love.
it seems to be a law of nature that the person you like the most rarely cares about you.
i met a man on the internet that i like.
i have never asked a man for a date; however, i have frequently heard that.
men do not like if when women get too possessive.
you should find another person who is not a loser.
find a gentleman that like you.
this is difficult.
did you tell your friend that you like him? if not, you may be too late.
we broke up because he did not want children; and, i have two.
you need to see them.
if others object, that is unfortunate.
i do not think that he feels the same.
i have posted some profiles on dating sites.
it would probably cause you to feel very good.
i cannot help but wonder who he kissed at midnight.
if you are going to see him frequently, you should always dress your best!
i wish you a wonderful married life in advance.
he cannot be stupid because he recognizes how special you are.
if you are tired of spending time with her, then you and i should consider dating again.
hello, gentlemen. i would like to know what interests you, so that i can have a few ideas to try with my significant other.
i'm not quite sure. give me some advice, gentlemen.
polite gentlemen verbally communicate what they're feeling when the female doesn't want to.
however, i wouldn't advise going down the same path.
if you're sure that you like this one, then go for it.
my favorite pick up line is, "can i buy you a drink, or do you just want the money?".
when you are serious about dating.
be friends and communicate.
since you are in prison, i will not give you my address.
on the bright side, he may want to buy a new swimsuit for you.
he is perfect, except he enjoys football.
there is nothing i would change from my wedding.
does your crush and his friends mind you going out with them?
it is about $350, is that too expensive a gift?
i expect a man to pay a portion of the bill if i go out on a date with him.
be certain not to get in to a serious relationship with a guy because you have plenty of time for that later.
she and i brought our dogs there.
it is your choice if would like to stay and correct any problems.
you know you need it during summer. it is warm, very good, and flowers are blooming.
use it to your advantage, perhaps he has a fetish for underwear.
and very eccentric so we can try new sexual things.
take my well-earned advice and leave him be.
i almost do not notice hair color.
simply do not act, as there is no solution to this problem.
obtain a book about marriage and making it successful, and then leave it in a very noticeable place.
he is, in fact, calling her each day?
i am asking if you know where she was married, as it is a legal, public document.
both of my parents are no longer alive.
you are not entitled to this.
you are in tears when they are not around.
you consent to it.
they know nothing about cheerleading.
it's good that you want to spend a lot of time with him.
and it goes without saying that you have no right to act in this way!
additionally, when you are not in their presence, you only wish to cry.
you find the situation acceptable.
this is coming from a person who does not engage in cheers.
would you always wish to be in his presence? yes, good.
at the end of the family reunion, i inquired if he could take me home.
simply ask him his opinions on relationships in general.
that is very wrong, and you should not do such a thing if it would harm your family.
almost all men want to try anal sex, and it does not mean that he is a closeted guy.
i do not know and i would like to learn the same information in regards to women.
yes, be a man and go to her first.
we'll give you a list of websites that can help your search.
first you need to be her friends and spend time with her.  then things will go as they go.
it depends on your relationship.  how long have you been married?
be honest with her.
these websites will give you the information you need.
love isn't hard; it's just trusting someone that's hard.
there are ways to make it more comfortable.
most of the guys i know became more serious after they turned 24 or 25.
hello again! i think i answered one of your other questions earlier.
i suggest finding yourself a country girl o r a third-world woman who'll make you feel like a strong man.
i hope that you have a lot of money.
you should get your life together and move on.
if you like shades of blue and purple you will like periwinkle.
you will figure out what females enjoy with more practice.
first of all, i would like you to know that you're special!
i wish that he would communicate to me that he loved me.
are you willing to risk everything?
you could attempt to use the internet or a chat hotline.
what is your opinion on engaging in sexual intercourse with a best friend? would it ruin the friendship or make it stronger?
sex before marriage is a sin.
do you live in tampa bay?
if it is okay with her, then i am fine with it.
men and women love sex equally.
you should get a nice trendy haircut.
do you live in the bay area?
if you love her it is limitless.
what is the most popular club in your area?
if you really love the person, then you'll forgive them.
suddenly, i no longer have the urge.
yes, it is a sin unless you're married.
my youngest doesn't want me to date anyone unless it's her.
i thought it was one particular child but when i asked, it was not him.
it is not bad.
is he there for you when you need him?
do not stay out of pity for him.
you should sleep with her future husband.
like i mentioned, it all depends on the couple.
it depends on the mood of the date, i believe.
i can't imagine where you would have time for more than one.
a ton of men start rumors to build up their personas.
if you have an awesome man or woman in your life, you should be content.
i have been wanting to fill you in on some information.
lieing to you or trying to deceive you should not be tolerated.
move on and be happy for her.
his exact words were, "i have a surprise for you!"
you go girl, is not what men think it is.
it is merely appearing that way.
when you would honestly be willing to do anything for them, and you don't simply have feelings for them, because feelings do not last.
how does a person get someone who will marry him/her? find them and propose, of course.
it would be insensible to be looking at them while kissing them. think about it.
if that does not work, then you need the help of an outsider, such as viagra.
if i am neither single nor dating, am i therefore not supposed to breathe?
not each one of them, but some of them, nonetheless.
if you give him a smile, he returns your smile.
it could imply that you will have to act first.
my girlfriend is very kind!
the usual explanation is that males who attempt to go about doing what is moral and ethical in their behavior with others may ultimately receive negative retribution.
as a consequence, i do not believe that this line of inference will bring positive outcomes.
it is with the greatest pleasure that we at last make your acquaintance.
the bonds of your friendship will sustain you and help you overcome.
i am unsure of myself since i still have deep feelings of caring for him.
it states that someone in your life is attempting to force their will upon you.
enjoy every day with someone you trust and can confide your feelings in.
do not plunge in if you are not ready.
she got him before "you know".
realistically, i know that i am.
she is currently interested in another man, but it does not appear to be a serious relationship.
unless you are doing something inappropriate, you do not need to worry.
it is my advice that you stop.
i would not ever consider doing that, unless he was a toddler.
carefully consider your feelings and desires, then follow them.
it depends on the two in the relationship, what are they looking for?
you like to have both options.
it is at least a million dollars.
christians have given their life to jesus, so it is no longer your choice.
it depends on both the man and the woman and what they both are seeking.
trust me when i say that you only want sexual intercourse from both.
it is, after all, a million dollars.
since christians have already given their lives over to jesus, it is no longer your choice to act on it, correct?
there will be no complaining, interjecting, or discussions of any kind about it.
we are different ages, i am older.
you could ask me for my pictures if you are interested, just joking.
as far as sex goes, it is really the best.
once she is no longer a minor, she is free to do whatever or whoever she likes,
we have a wonderful friendship and i don't want to ruin it.
you should enjoy your life with the one you love most.
don't follow them around either.
i was never over there, so i am of no help, i am sorry.
it is to enjoy life with the person you love most.
do not be a strange stalker either.
if you can answer that then you know the answer to your question.
when you are friends with a woman.
sorry, but i was never there so i cannot answer. goodbye.
dream on ladies, just love him for who he is not who he was!
you need one coupon for a back message.
if he is unattractive, do not bother him.
i cannot accept this treatment!
most men are still willing to be unfaithful in relationships.
you only get to be odd when you feel like it.
do what every woman has ever done to me.
if there is a connection, then i will date him.
remember where you first heard this!
how desperate can a person become?
i have not consummated my marriage.
yes, we can talk online.
most big problems, start small.
it is not big but it is full of love!
i do not know or understand it either.
beat your head against a wall until you forget all of that nonsense.
oh, most of us fake it.
taking a tylenol before sex helps me a lot!
i've been old that levitra is better than viagra.
i looked at him, and he turned away from me.
he doesn't choose to be this way, believe me.
i understand, but please don't share your age online!
i will give her half the money after i slap her.
no, it will not make your friendship stronger, but it wont last forever, so go ahead.
but, they should notice you anyway.
do not let that stop you.
so go ahead, do the right thing.
i have to ask, does he really love you?
what sort of man are you seeking?
why is she the best woman i ever met?
when you can't stand to be apart for one minute.
it may not be that extreme, but you must tell her.
think about what might happen.
you should have no problem doing that.
now that time has passed my perspective of the situation has changed, but at the time it was not amusing.
even though he is unfaithful, he is happily married.
your relationship will last if you love one another.
should i pursue the relationship, or let it go?
because, good men get mired in the ljbf zone...and become a shoulder on which to cry.
in other words...when i am in love...i share.
if you do not know about the g-spot, then you have a probem.
no, i will not my mother because of damn money.
if you are using 'it' to refer to 'sex', then no, i have not.
the entire situation is complicated, but it is worth it if he is everything.
tell him what kind of promiscuous girl she really is.
we had a coke and ate pizza.
have you tried a wingman?
it sounds very much like me.
you certainly would not accept that behavior.
i do not need to talk, however , if he is watching television feel free to accompany him.
actually, i feel i can add to this. is it possible that you might be a bit shy?
men will not touch things that they are not attracted to.
had he been in love with you he would have spent new years eve with you and no one else.
i must say no.
because every man is tempted by different things.
the question you ask depends on your answer. be straight forward, do you understand?
i just asked him and he said, "no, she is undesirable."
no, i am twenty-one years old and engaged to a twenty-two year old.
if she comes by your home apologize and inform her you were on your way out.
picture what her breasts will look like when she is older.
you should go out and have fun, show him your life goes on without him.
is it all right to not know the identity of your father?
he might believe he is an wonderful lover but you are saying he isn't.
a person's characteristics are not always known by how they appear.
if not then make some improvements
i would say they have never kissed a girl before
additionally, she may be giving you a straight answer just not the one you want to hear.
if you are going to be around for a long period of time then at least be productive.
if you have anymore inquiries, just ask.
no you're not devious!
not enough, perhaps once a week at most.
the problem is not about you explain it.
you should definitely e-mail him.
mumbling at length about how her love caused her heartache.
if you are a girl then what i said does not apply since i am a boy.
removing yourself from the situation seems the simplest solution at times.
women are acquisitive. give them both and they will say, "it is not working well enough, darling."
i find familiar friends comforting.
my boyfriend thinks that men are always attracted to me even though i never see any clues that they might be.
it is better that you find out.
if you love her, stay with her.
me, i like for there to be hair down there.
not all women are like this.
i wish you the best of luck and do not lose your focus.
certainly because girls always prefer winning.
that is how it often begins, once they meet one thing often leads right to something else.
the alternative would be to bring plenty of horror movies, this would be an idea treat for him on valentines day.
however, i once had the pleasure of meeting a lovely woman in the park
it is natural because he is a move star.
the man i was referred to provided good answers.
there is nothing wrong with that if you cannot get it the real way.
that would make life too easy.
but that does not mean it would not be acceptable to have a working relationship.
i could use some great ideas on how to make the album in a fun way.
maybe it's just me, but i would prefer to not have any contact with them.
you have to let them know where you stand.
just remember, don't look for it and it will find you.
i know you're hurting right now.
sometimes you have to let the people you love go.
it messed with my feelings.
how am i supposed to take care of this?
i don't know any other except mine.
as everyone else said, i don't think there are any excuses.
yes, i know cindy. it is tough isn't it?
not that idiot, tell him in a note!
i appreciate a nice bottom, so with your two choices i would pick b.
i like most guys who have a little stomach, do you know why?
scream her sister's name in bed and do not apologize.
thank you for your comment posted to my question.  i hope this helps in some way.
if you do not enjoy it, then he should respect you and leave it be.
once you become friends, then you may start a flirtation with him and move closer.
well, you do have it difficult, do you not?
most importantly, does he anser the same about you?  for your sake, i surely hope he does.
on average, i believe it is around age sixteen or seventeen for gentlemen and age fourteen or fifteen for ladies.
in order to definitively decide he isn't only seeking to have sexual relations with him, make him wait.
it should only be done in fun, not thought of as something more than what it is.
she will drive off into the sunset with another man to begin her new life.
you will indeed, simply be patient and confident.
i have had similar dreams.
if he lets them know that you two are in a relationship, keep him in your life; if he leads them on, end the relationship.
all that you can do is to ponder them.
i apologize, but size is important.  for me, the ideal penis length is no less than 6.
you need not worry, just give it your best!
if you feel afraid, ask yourself who was there before you were.
you are experiencing the thrill of the chase.
i hope you understand what you would have to endure.
every type of girl is welcome: from goths to geeks.
if you are male, don't get together with someone your friends like - choose someone you like.
how about you - would you do it?
this is when you will know how to court.
my extremely beautiful girlfriend, of course.
in any case, a few hours was never bad for anyone.
the ideal girlfriend would love me more and more each day.
my boyfriend has many attractive features, including a great hindend.
even though this is a bad idea, i can not stop myself.
make sure he is in the right hole.
i had premarital sex and i cheated on my wife, so it is apparent that i do not believe in god.
he acts whiney at times, but what man does not do that?
not all asian women submit to white men.
also, it is too far for her to constantly travel.
if you are a girl please wait because i promise he will come.
when you get married you are supposed to give your whole self and not only part of yourself.
we have a special relationship.
under the current circumstances, no real relationship exists.
you should suggest both of you venture out to dinner or a movie.
i think you might enjoy a change in sexual orientation.
unfortunatly you discovered it was too late.
i understand the feelings you are having.
explain to her you want other women.
i had sufficient love to cover them both.
if you did sleep with him remember she probably did the same.
a good listener will always be there for you.
as far as appearance goes: a
even if you were aware they were always intimate?
it depends on the seriousness of your attraction.
it's not that women who are overweight are sexually promiscuous because they desire it.
ask the woman and tell her that you and some colleagues are going.
because someone was there looking in the window at you, or you got off.
go on a group date with a group of friends.
do not forget many hungs and kisses too.
if you have not, you cannot blame her.
he probably thought he could get something from you by telling you he loved you.
hello, i am 12 as well and i spend time with men i am interested in all the time.
be the first to do it and invite her.
why can she not simply out you>
i know that no one can help who they fall in love with, but ugh!
this is a fact i learned after passing nine years with the incorrect man.
it is difficult in the modern world to be appreciated for oneself, even in one's own mind.
because you must find a better use for your time.
men do not all think in the same way.
i will locate it on my own and surprise him with it.
it is probably bigger than yours.
that depends on the whole picture, doesn't it?
i am a man's man, and there a many more.
if the girl is 16-18 then 2-4 years isn't terrible.
if she isn't rude, think of something to ask like "do we live near each other?"
do not look at other girls when you are in her presence and continue to reassure her that you love her.
i am a guy that gets very attached, but i have noticed that the women i date do not put much effort.
however, if you truly have feelings towards him you should converse with him.
no.  she is your biggest enemy, and she is not a companion.
setting up frequent correspondence like instant messaging with or without webcam
i believe that women can understand and please others better because we have more knowledge regarding the body its pleasure areas.
so few truly romantic men exist anymore.
you will be more popular if you become a cheerleader.
to answer your question, i prefer looks over knowledge. be grateful i did not answer, "both!"
you should be upfront with her before the situation spirals out of control.
yes, he is cheating on you with another woman, and your marriage is over.
you must first address your own issues, and strive to be more extroverted.
rather than say anything, just play on equal terms!
not all men are uncaring.
try bumping into her while she is holding something in her hands, and when it drops, pick it up.
i have been in that position before, but you do not need to be told to forget about him.
live in the present moment; do not worry about what yesterday was or what tomorrow will hold.
you know the old adage: listen to your instinct.
how frightening is that if you are not truly interested in a committment.
i know it is embarrassing, but you must ask them!
it is not your perception, it does beyond god and the devil.
the average goes up during those times.
focus on things that make you happy.
you will most likely end up enjoying it.
everything i have sexual intercourse, i get an erection, but i can't finish.
you need to be confident in yourself before you can handle independence.
tomorrow is one day closer to your death.
would you like to be a sugar daddy for a young woman?
follow your head not your heart.
it is time to rent a movie and pick up food.
i work 6 nights every week from 10pm until 6am, easter standard time.
obviously she loves you, so you should reciprocate her love.
i do not believe it is acceptable to put up with that kind of behavior.
i thought the man was suppose to be asking that question
so, mix it up a little.
you are fifteen: the age when you start to get intense sexual feelings and orgasms.
very attractive girls have low self-esteem.
will you be yourself if that makes him happy?
now i do not know how to make myself appear available.
if i see a woman who i find attractive, should i have coitus with her?
you should speak with her and tell her how you feel about the man in whom you are interested.
be nice to her for now. when she is single once again, be brave and ask her on a date.
if he rejects you, then go find the one who you are meant to marry.
try the product, if it is good you, you did a good job.
you know what they say.
do not play games, just be forward with your intentions.
i am 26 years old, would it be okay?
of course, but i am not easy.
do not feel bad, that has happened to me.
do you ever visit arkansas? also, do you have a photograph?
without a girlfriend you have no chance.
yes, she should make you leave. if you need a place to stay call the boys' town national hotline, you scoundrel.
the perfect woman is in mexico.
that is not merely bad but atrocious.
act as he likes and be who he likes and this will cause him to notice how much you care.
when you are in love then you know it.
perhaps you could demonstrate to her that the man is the head of the household but is willing to share in the decision making process before a decision is made.
women expect a lot from a man.
why would i get on to you twice, if it did not work before?
send me a line on messenger if you would like.
you should either stand by him or leave, the decision is up to you.
i am aware everyone does it, i think it is how women are.
don't give up, you should have fun.
does anyone think she is seeking attention?
if you aren't in love with your spouse, instead of cheating just get a divorce.
does this make me look fat?
god will forgive you if you make a mistake!
don't worry about them laughing at you.
why would you want a woman to pay for dates.
as far as your love is concerned; keep looking, be careful and you will find the right one.
if she is a bad lady, then do not talk to her. stay away from her.
i can look at women and think they are very attractive.
it is just as important as the time you spend with them.
plan something simple and enjoyable in case she asks, "doing what?"
it means this is how it is, and this is how it is going to be.
some people find it very nice.  others do not want to try it again.
enough is enough when you can not take it anymore.
we met on line.  he had a picture on the site, but i did not have a picture.
what should i wear?
do not wait.  surprise him and do it first!
so i guess that is just us.
when someone found out, they said, "isn't that too soon?"
of course, it is not all men.
do what makes you happy.
some women enjoy it, and some do not.
how do you know that person is the one with whom you should be involved?
some women have very sensitive nipples, and some women do not.
does he kiss better than your sister kisses?
whether or not he chooses to date women is a completely different matter.
you are a homosexual if you like that.
guys can get an idea of what that is.
how does one stay in love?
yes, it is true that one sometimes loses something in love.
prostitutes are a choice that i would vouch for.
however, be cautious about what signals you are sending one another.
ask her why an attractive woman such as herself is dining alone.
if not, then try asking him why.
should i stop being friends with them?
do not concern yourself about being different for it gives you an edge in comparison to other men.
do not think about the motions involved, but just try to get your partner sexually aroused.
follow through with it and then let us know the results.
it is inappropriate to view your friend's boyfriend in that manner.
he said the same to me, which made me very happy.
once a cheater, always a cheater.
you could give her six red and six white. differentiate yourself.
it was my first time. i do not know how many times he previously attempted it.
what if your life flashes before your eyes, but he is not in it?
man or woman, that is being a friend.
if you believe he is interesting then say so, if you believe he is humorous, tell him you make me laugh!
please send me the film..thanks..send it to 234 yankers way, jo, ok, 23456.
that is the best decision, ask him, if you are to shy to ask then have someone else ask for you.
begin by telling them about yourself.
perhaps get her something she will enjoy, but avoid choosing something too personal.
i love you: small gestures like that are of great use.
hilarious and enjoyable to spend time with.
age is irrelevant: younger or older, do you believe that his behavior is childish?
does he still desire me physically, or is he trying to be kind?
but i stopped liking him because i did not want to harm our relationship.
i think there are many more men out there!
be naked in front of him when you are alone, that always gets my attention.
the only thing is that i think he is using me.
i think i may be homosexual, so we can be friends of a sort.
simply express your interest to him!
i do not know why.  i have to urinate as well.  i am a man.
i came to realize that she was not the sort of woman that interested me.
that is analgous to saying, "are women always unfaithful?"
you have the opportunity but don't reject a lady for her looks or something silly along those lines.
are you remorseful for your actions?
i suppose you aren't speaking of a new acquaintance of yours.
despite all of the love one has bestowed upon another, the person desires a new thing.
the first step is open dialogue, and without it, you would be unsure as to how to please him.
i am going to be rude and say "no."
out of sight means out of mind.
a worthy man would not accept a dare like that because he would not want to risk losing you.
my question to all females is, "what do you want in a boyfriend?"
why be sad often when all that does is hurt other people?
if you are hoping not to cause her any harm, then i recommend you carry it out as fast as you can.
i think it is likely his mother, if they have a close relationship and if he is afraid of her.
it is reasonable to assume that your boyfriend has fantasies.
he and i now enjoy a very close friendship.
i would recommend that the next step be that you move your hands to his groin.
if he cared he would have called you back.
i do not mean to sound like a butthead.
not all mean cheat.  you just seem to find the wrong guys.
so that they will not be called prostitutes.
why not, if you agree to trust and be a part of the person you wanna stay with.
he cares and will call back if he can.
i do not mean to bother you.
there are some faithful men out there.
a good name is better than rubies and pearls.
if you agree to trust one another and be loyal then it will work.
only discuss your child with him.
that sounds like the biggest mistake a person could make.
what is first base? is it kissing, hand holding, or a hug?
hello, who are you?
once a cheater, always a cheater.
cold turkey the relationship honey, like with heroin or cigarettes.
borrow some money, i am lacking money right now.
it is not an orgasm, i read an article once, where women mistake they're orgasms with some bladder problems.
because you cannot get a girlfriend.
men and women have minds that work differently.
only a bad person would do this.
there are consequences if you do not do any better.
now that i have new friends, i am happier and deal with less gossip.
there will be problem no matter how you do things.
kiss them and embrace them and say "i love you", that should do it.
and if your parents diapprove tell them you really need to do this; i wish they will understand.
please don't give up on your life:
well if you love that one girl then you should put yourself out there.
but you want like the anus, because they come in different sizes, such as bust size.
the clitoris and the penis can be connected with one another.
them claiming that you are homosexual sounds like bitterness to me.
you will have many disagreements.
i do not know if i should allow him another opportunity.
perhaps "hello, my name is..." additionally, stop utilizing this site to help you find sexual relationships. that is simply pathetic.
or might there be another reason behind it?
yes, there are, it is merely difficult to locate them.
it depends on exactly how you think of it.
in any case, you know that it is not very common.
do you go with who you prefer or what is right and how might you know the difference?
take a look at my blog with the username: ykalex.  i would love to hear your feedback.
spend your time appropriately without wasting it.  it is also your life.  question him.
a good friend of mine has located an extremely pleasant guy.  they have been a couple for five years.
please avoid referring to yourself as the term "black."
unclothed women and men partake in sexual activities.
if a woman teases or introduces herself several times you should feel good.
otherwise do not spend your time with her.
be sure to have a warning before ending.
take things slowly there is no need to rush.
the flowers i can think of are: tulips, lilies, and dragon snaps.
maybe a playstation or some music.
i was going to terminate our relationship, but he ended things beforehand.
i feel that he favored it and i was proud of myself for being bold.
men need to be presented with something to pursue.
i do not lose the feelings. however, you most likely do because you are actively pondering over it.
take off your clothes, and pleasure him.
did you wait for him to speak first?
if you're not happy, get a divorce and find someone else!
find a good man, but don't deny him children.
i left college in january, and also broke up with my boyfriend.
you may need to speak to a family counselor.
why are all the desirable men either married or homosexual?
different people have different views of what is sexy and what is not.
i bet you will attract a lot of young men under the age of twenty-one.
if it doesn't work out, you just have to wait one more year my dear.
don't forget that you get to see him everyday!
the only thing i'd like to know about women is why they all think they are fat!
enjoy the cruise back to the dock , after that it's up to you ;)
before i reply may i ask if he is a rich dealer?
perhaps you could try the secret admirer ploy.
chances are he likes you too!
you can tell when someone either likes you or is cheating on you.
if you want, you may contact a psychiatrist.
if you are looking for a friend, that is okay, but other than that you are on the wrong website.
they just became big jerks.
my ex-wife cheated on me, and i still gave her a chance.
i am brittany just to let you know.
after three years, we got married.
if women can get silicon breasts, i think getting silicon in your instrument is possible.
my friend and i are looking for some women.
there is only one me.
you are either good or bad.
tell him how you feel face to face.
you cannot remarry if you are a  christian who commits adultery.
it would help if there were more than just one of you.
generally, there is no good or bad.
walk up to him and say, "i like you".
is a second marriage against your religion?
even if it is difficult, you have the ability to be better than her.
eyes open or closed, forceful kisser, public kisser, kisser with tongue, nonspecific kisser
you will achieve it with practice
make believe that you are pretending to be your partner with a boy who is also your friend.
i do not share my partner with anyone.
first of all, it is unusual for a girl to ask a man to dance.

i was informed via his mother.
you will never know until you figure it out.
i also like boys with large, silky lips.
you need to break up with him.
okay, so i developed this crush on a best friend of mine and he has knowledge of it.
men lie because they believe it is right to try and protect you from the truth by lieing.
if the friendship is real then he will not be offended.
state your opinion before you  lose the opportunity.
to dream a dream is merely a dream but to dream of the one you love is reality.
there is no answer but the time will tell.
i agree with mn_sassygirl, plus the addition of a long and exotic honeymoon afterwards.
he is imprisoned now because of a man i am friends with.
it said to ask any and all questions and i wanted to see what would happen.
occupy your mind with something else and look for other things to do.
if it helps at all, please know that they are both very smart and mature.
you should stay away from that man.
it is important that you yourself believe it so you should get out in the world and have experiences before discussing it.
it is due to people enjoying discussing sex.
i believe that gentleman is so very handsome he must be into other men.
maybe your luck will change in the future, you should not place all your bets on a man.
that is the way the world works.
ask him to pray for guidance with you.
are you asking men or women?
maybe you should use stronger deodorant.
why do you call yourself "black"?
no, if you think that, then you are not doing it right.
trust me on this, it will not hurt at all. in fact, it will help you feel much better!
i am really interested in him and i am aware that his feelings are mutual. the issue is how do i begin to pursue this relationship?
they are just sharing their input and thoughts about your boyfriend.
what more could you ask for? she is already interested in you as well.
it is very difficult when you are dying to know what occurred.
she lost weight and that dress fits fine.
he called me to tell me he loves me.
there is a difference between love and obsession.
you have to be eighteen but no younger than sixteen.
no excessive exclamation points.
if you get the chance, don't make it easy on him.
don't attempt to befriend her, she will betray you.
if she asks, that girl is not a good person.
try as i might, i can't figure it out either.
personally, i think you put yourself out in the public eye.
a vibrator is a dildo.
it means drop whatever you were talking about.
do not just hang on unless she is extremely wealthy.
there are a lot of things that you can do.
i only like him as a friend, english!
try to be nice. he is confused about what do to with himself.
do not try to hard because you are going to fail. just let it happen.
i am ready to start meeting new people again but i must confess that i am scared.
i saved a lot of money by taking her to ihop.
nobody knew the second person was one of my managers.
she misses you and that means you still have a chance to be with her.
that's a great question that i have no answer to.
men are lacking in intelligence.
should i date somebody that is older than me?
life is a two way street.
i dislike hair that i consider too short in length.
do you know your best friend's feelings on this subject?
i tell men that i have feelings for them; it is really simple!
i got a divorce because of it.
if you had legitimate reasons for lying, you should explain to him why you lied.
the best way would be to do it face to face.
the person you are seeking is not me.
if you feel like you are that brave, then you should give it a go.
the moment you find out they are using drugs.
would it be improper to request you to send a video of what you have been up to?
see how he responds if you stop calling him. men like to be chased
the buffet was small, but it served over 250 people.
you are looking for a guy who needs to be fixed up.
if i have true feelings for a girl i will behave properly.
what truly matters is whether or not it makes you happy.
should i begin being mean?
i need a spouse.
email me and then i will present the pictures to you.
males that smell like body odor and patchouli.
it is experience and whole life.
watch how you carry yourself in public.
he is cute but my friends call him "monkeyboy".
personally, i like to woo-hoo.
of course, go with the one who loves me.
i am in my late 20's with no children.
personally, if you choose to end the relationship it will cause lots of drama.
it sounds silly, but it is something women enjoy and it can be a lot of fun.
what plans do you have if you happen to get pregnant before you even enter high school?
what else besides being under someones thumb?
my advice is that you end the sexual relations and move on.
...or for that matter, to be married or have children with someone like that.
you cannot help but to fall in love with some people, can you?
perhaps you should learn to spell "women."
i say hello at times, or simply allow him to stare at me. still, is he just too young to understand my feelings?
do not try to begin by saying that you like him.
demonstrate to him why he should desire you, and then allow him to ask you on a date.
you were incorrect, and i am hoping that you will go to jail for your actions.
they can sense those sorts of things.
her feelings may be hurt, though she will respect the fact that you let her know (at least, that is my opinion).
no, that should not occur unless you enter the site.
he is likely afraid that you may say no.
it is different - oh, my goodness.
if you say that they are fat, but they are a size 5-6, they will get angry.
i hope you determine what he is doing.
i would say something like "what in the heavens are you thinking?"
maybe you should ask you mother for advice?
friends have their own opinions, you don't need to copy them.
he could kiss you first, but you can also give him a kiss.
try meeting them, but be late to the meeting.
that is what an adult man would do.
wow, i have to tell you i believe you are far too young.
just make sure you don't pursue him.
i am deeply in love with my boyfriend.
you should turn it down, friendship is far more than sex.
you should file a lawsuit against both of them.
i want to be sexually intimate with the guy i have been dating for the past month. he is very attractive.
i would much rather be with a person who feels complete than someone who is looking for me to complete them.
your next door neighbor? only if she is older than 22 and unmarried.
i am recommending reseaching apartments, good jobs, nearby schools, and things of that nature.
the damage has occurred, and an apology will not improve her situation.
you should recieve yours, because i received mine today.
whatever you do, tell the truth.
when we began our relationship, she tried to get him back but was unsuccessful.
the woman suffices to have support over endearments.
i believe i have made your acquaintance before.
if he does not like you why would you want his affection.
i behave like another gentleman instead of a potential female companion.
in due time she will come to understand your care for her and she will accept you.
or just leave things as they are and accept them as they are.
gentleman, how long would you like a lady to wait before she tells you that she loves you?  would you prefer to say it first?
either that or his lovely azure eyes.
try to have a conversation with her about her own self.
all you need to do is be relaxed and avoid studdering or something of that nature.
then maybe you should break up with her and then go out with me.
if you re looking for a friends, then tell me about yourself.
look in the norwalk phone book, for ernie anguino.
would you like it if somebody touches your wife?
what is his problem after 8 years?
he wants to be her boyfriend.
look up ernie anguino in the white pages.
what would you do if someone touched your wife?
it has been eight years with no problems till now.
good luck, i know it's not easy.
i think you need to start family therapy right away.
don't keep pestering her, girls do not like that.
try to understand that unless you create something foolish, they won't laugh at you.
how can i overcome this?
if you feel this way, maybe you are falling in love.
some men don't realize how lucky they are.
women love when a man is a gentleman.
this sounds like it may be the beginning of a fight.
yes, unfortunately they're difficult to find.
it seems as if she's being sneaky, most likely she's with him.
i would certainly love to be your friend.
please help me, i'm really attracted to him.
it'd his occupation to make your life similar to hell.
good things come to those who wait.  besides he is probably waiting for a special moment.
if you do, make sure you keep receipts of your stuff!
even if you go somewhere when you do not want to, you should have fun.
laugh, and see what he says.
waiting for something miraculous to happen is not going to make it better.
you should mention to her that he is bothering you a great deal.
if he is unprepared, there is nothing he can do.
if you are in love with him, then it does not matter if he is purple.
you are completely right about your religious opinions.
my brother is older than them, though he remains for his games.
no, i urinate when i urinate.
yes, return the car so you are not at a total loss for finances.
yes, i do, and i am one of them.
why do people believe other people will make them feel whole?
it will be more akin to pouring salt over an open wound.
are you engaging in it simply for fun?
if you include me i will do it with you.
i have also discovered that a lot of people think true love is a myth.
you should go to the park and engage in a good old game of catch.
if she interrupts and tries to sway your beliefs, don't be distracted simply stick to your original response.
you should not have a hard time finding someone else if you keep doing so well for yourself.
if things do not get better, do not worry.
look both directions and then look upwards.
i do not know, do they have it there or you are inviting?
i am ten, am i too young to have a first kiss?
he might be too scared to try.
if i was your wife, i would leave you as well.
there maybe an underlying problem.
this is like trying to make a heroin addict stop using the drug.
he has been talking to ex-wife more often, i don't understand what's going on with him.
for both men and women, coyness can be appealing at times while talk can be unnecessary.
oh, you should remember anniversaries, birthdays, etc...
if it does not work, then kick them both to the curb.
you can either give him a swift kick somewhere it hurts or you can just flat out embarrass him.
he is weird and cannot control any of his impulses.
she will not be able to cheat on anyone.
hang up before the answering machine clicks.
try not to look too much like a prostitute.
yes, even if he looks at pornographic imagery.
get as much value out of your investment as possible.
you have the rest of your entire life. whatever you decide to do, you should not sneak behind your mother's back.
everyone is doing it and if they say they are not, then they are definitely lying.
a guy i dated once told me this, do you know what he inferring?
you should show him that you are interested in another man!
a majority of mean ask her things they do not actually want, such as a relationship. however, others flat out lie in order to get what they really want.
find at least ten women in whom you might be interested.
court him for a time, then ask him on a date.
his/her mother did not have to, but he/she did.
do not forget that he is your friend's boyfriend.
the only reason a man would become a girl's best friend is if he is interested in her.
in the meantime, go out and enjoy yourself.
if it is too many then spare him.
in order to french kiss a person, one must use the tongue.
follow her and let her know how you feel.
do not wait because he might go with someone else.
you should wait for a while, then sit down and discuss it.
you might find someone if you stop playing on the computer and go out to find someone.
i am fun and attractive but cannot seem to find a guy.
that is not nice and you should end it.
i would prefer if my girlfriends did not consider my boyfriend a handsome man.
if they want my services, they need to prove that they deserve me.
you should move on as there are lots of other men available.
i think you should move on but be sure to keep your options open.
is this a man or a woman?
i think you need to wait until you become mature enough to handle this situation.
you should not neglect yourself just because you are married now.
if that is not the solution, then there is definitely an issue.
possibly because they think they are too good for anyone!
i think you should just sit on his lap so you can make him laugh and think about going home with you later.
this is not the middle ages. it is perfectly acceptable for a woman to make the first overture.
i deeply regret not waiting for marriage.
men love to hear that they are liked.
my husband when he returns home from work.
perhaps you should try to keep in mind all three people.
his age is not important, you should imagine him at his best.
i wish you luck.
i do not know who will let me kiss them.
she has a lot of baggage, you may want to avoid her.
if you are worried about the consequences, you may wish to avoid sex.
maintain your values and good luck.
you know what i am talking about.
that is ok, i will take the two points and exit.
you can get us an emotional card and a gift, it would be appropriate.
that is, at the least, what it seems like.
i find it difficult to confess.
if you love him, he loves you.
there is guy that i adore and i just heard that he found out.
try gerber daisies. they come in every color and size you could ever want.
i do not care about what these other people say
he had affairs with two of my friends and is irresponsible.
you do not have to make a decision just this very minute.
it simply is not a possibility.
you went to such extremes to resume a relationship with this person that you injured innocent people.
as evident, my feet were very comfortable.
do you know what i say?
in my opinion, thinner women are more attractive.
my best experience was becoming a christian. that was the best experience.
is it not enough that she is nice and caring?
i do not abide by doing bad things to children.
in my 20 years' experience, neither option is a good one.
take the higher road and apologize to her.
it teaches men how to get women's attention for less money.
i'm not sure he feels that way toward me.
attempt to watch a movie with him, perhaps one that you know he'd enjoy.
you will see what love can do.
it got to the point that men were like tissue:  soft, cuddly, and disposable.
perhaps she is not a lesbian.
no offense, but jupiter is saying that because he is a male.
if you're both deep in love and of age, there is no harm in continuing.
be confident. as nike says, "just do it." i wish you all the best.
why is it that, so often, men treat women badly?
just stay the course and your situation will improve.
if she has not said it yet, ask her if she loves you and continue from there.
if she is an outdoor person, take her to the beach.
i think the fact that you called him means it would be appropriate to see him.
did honey want to have sex not work?
you would benefit from taking sugar pills and thinking that it is getting bigger.
a soul mate is possibly true love. just having fun is as many lovers as will have you.
i would not want it any other way.
we did not play well so we could not win
you are not the one to marry her, is your family more religious than his family?
i have a friend who's father has just passed away.
stop walking and start running.
perform fellatio occasionally and he will like that.
i had read the fountainhead before i was thirteen years old.
this line in blank and has no text.
after some time, it will get easier.
he most likely would not be expecting to meet someone in that manner.
some women are like that, but i wish you luck.
that is an odd question to come out of a girl's mouth.
i'm saying that one day, you could just be walking out of the door and find the girl of your dreams.
i have to go and get my shoulder blades worked on, we will talk soon.
try a slightly older one, maybe around 26. they last longer and they know what they are doing.
clitoris, but before that, nipples, and before that, lips and neck, and behind the ears.
i just do this to get those stupid points.
everyone seems to think that i am the naive one, but i know i am not.
make a new friend, and wait ten years.
it is not good for you, and it can tear you apart.
do not depart from him if you have feelings for him.
guys are friends with girls that they are interested in.
my friend said he thinks he likes me.
he can only go as far as you let him.
if you care for him, then you should stay with him.
i know of some guys who are friends with girls they are attracted to.
i like my best (guy)friend.  my other best friend thinks he like me.
why would i go as far as he wants me to go if he is all those things?
be yourself, do not put on a show.  do not do anything i would not do.
just as kaitlyn said, i am sorry i am of no help. it is my job to disappoint people.
then i would like for all my former significant others to be similar to you.
you can do nothing and it will be fine.
i need advice. should i ask him what he feels for her and what he feels for me?
no, i do not think it is possible.
i feel that if a person doesn't want to be with me then they should end the relationship.
i feel that i'm in love but i am not sure if how to ask her on a date.
i feal that a perfect person would not be fun a fun person.
i would catch him by surprise and kiss him first.
as you get older, dating only gets better.
boredom is caused by too much input, or desire, and a lack of output.
it's simple: just read a love story before bed!
you can't receive oral sex if you aren't aroused.
i love a girl, but she only wants to be friends.
there must be some positive aspect of marriage.
you can avoid it - unless you are a glutton for punishment. in that case, go ahead!
i am just wondering. there are many predators out there.
go quietly, and please close the door when you leave.
there are many single women out there who do not want to commit.
i wish my boyfriend would do some of those things.
there is no way that you could do that.
if you do not like me i cannot help it because i like myself a lot.
when i see a girl i think of flirting with her.
yes, but in reality it is more likely lust at first sight.
a hug will make her want more.
buy flowers for her and take her to see a film.
i am sure i know what you are doing right now.
if you love him then i believe you should follow your heart.
we men need to be trained to be able to do anything.
i met my husband eight years ago and have been married to him for almost six.
at that point you will have certainty.
i know they are effective, and i am telling the truth.
you should not kiss anyone until you are 15 years old.
she simply wants this man to like her.
this is what occurred.
you are uninformed on what a virbator truly is.
i often inform her that she isn't.
not true, it really just means that you open to new ideas.
i am ok with the idea but i cannot get the thought of him out of my head.
that won't work, it will change the way he views you.
cheating is not the correct word.
first ask if they are interested in e-mailing you. after provide your email address and question.
several individuals say that the boy is young and immature.
i am in agreement with dee, when someone that cheats gets married, they are selfish.
i assure you, she will respond the same way.
personally have no use for illicit drugs; a friend who peddles that garbage is not a genuine friend.
yes, what do you have to lose unless you are a prostitute.
regardless, i know you most likely love that person quite deeply, so do not forget him and leave.
you definitely come across as a little ***** by not moving on past it.
i would love to talk to him, but i am quite timid and simply cannot do it.
it confuses them, guys typically like to be in control of the situation.
i would look at her and ask if she would like to split the bill.
if he doesn't, show him what went wrong and how to fix it.
wait for her to give you permission.
i wouldn't always depend on putting your spouse first.
you're with this person and no one else in the room, so do not look around.
you might just have an amazing body.
he is silly, get him back.
everything was good, but he cheated on me.
if it feels like it is time to break up, talk it over and make it happen.
he thinks he wants that thin french woman.
coitus is for married people, not single people.
sure it hurts people, but that is fine.
but would you tell that to someone you used to be in a relationship with? imagine the same thing being done to you.
not all men are rude.
do not feel to bad, we all have problems.
respond to me via e-mail and tell me how it goes.
well, refrain from asking him on a date for now.
even though you are hurt, love is still the simplest reason you are happy.
regretful and dissatisfied. you know inexperienced men are not careful.
when will you tell him that you love him?
does this man spend time around you and act differently than when he is around others?
be patient because god has someone who is best for you!
it is a boy and i love him.
i dj in clubs and other venues, and the ladies bathroom is a good place for gossip!
he's attractive and treats me well.
i want elvis to officiate my wedding.
some people prefer to have a casual relationship.
go tell her you like her.
i am thirteen and i sent him an email letting know i was interested in him.
that is difficult. do you know why they are speaking so much as of late?
wait until you are married but i prefer 17.
life is too short to lose the one you truly believe is for you.
tell them directly. it is simpler that way.
i am curious why you would ask that question at all.
someday, you will find out. it is unexplainable.
a simple charming kiss, and a gift of a red rose.
show them, help them, and things of that nature.
see how things progress from there.
perhaps because it is more fun to have options.
that is troublesome. courts can be difficult. i hope you find a pleasant woman who will not try to do anything negative.
in any case, you should not do the following: do not become intoxicated - instead, sip slowly on one or two drinks; and do not talk about past relationships.
perhaps he does not care for obscene things.
listen to what she says - i do not mean simply hear the words; i mean to listen carefully.
does that mean that i am bisexual?
you should write a list of the benefits and drawbacks for each man.
if you have a good relationship, you should not cheat on your significant other.
you should have sex with her, then treat her like a promiscous woman.
you should call her cell phone and ask her to buy tickets.
the first time you will not know what you are doing.
why do you believe that it needs to be enlarged?
one possible solution is to look up various flower meanings on google.
my boyfriend is infatuated with me.
i love her and we are the same age, but a relationship is impossible.
there is someone out there who would be a better match for her.
don't test me.
make her think you both are interested in the same thing.
just act naturally and enjoy yourself.
if you too like him, go on another date with hime.
you simply must know where to search.
will she ever be able to move beyond it?
we do not want to feel we have been rejected by someone we like or believe we like.
you are doing it incorrectly.
love is different for everyone, you have to be sure he is the one for you.
cheating is not morally right or honest.
if you do this for her she may give you something in return.
what school do you attend?
it is easier for me but more difficult for the woman.
you do it there.
a good personality will earn you a date with a girl.
she is not an original woman.
men with short hair are preferred.
it's easy to get in, but very hard to get out.
a "swinging cuckold" is a husband who enjoys watching his wife with another man.
as a woman, i suggest not being too blatant.
i am single and enjoying it immensely.
always get permission.
maybe a makeover is what she needs.
you know, the one person you want to spend the rest of your life with?
however, he was in the air force so it did not work out.
in my opinion as i stated before, i am not fat.
eventually you will see the "girl" in the girl.
we continue to speak and email occasionally.
do honest, attractive, and available women exist?
is that saying, "once a cheater, always a cheater" factual?
if you'd like an honest answer, you will need to provide more details.
if you like her, give her a token of your affection.
buy her flowers or something she likes,that will get her attention.
what if he likes me, but only as just a friend?
well if i ended a relationship with someone, i would want them to wait at least a week or some similar amount of time.
do not go with her, avoid her.
if she wants someone else other than you, then advise her to try that.
if the woman loves the man, she should tell him so.
that works for me with men that are just friends.
leave her if you cannot deal with that.
if you know he cheated more than once, then you know he will not reform overnight.
i believe that only you understand the importance of this.
that is the best sex position to use if you want to hit the g spot.
i am attracted to guys with long hair.
there are, however, some really great guys out there.
keep the faith because there are others out there and when you have self doubt just look in the mirror and smile.
if i were going to be married for the first time?
first, you must become acquainted with the person you are dating.
i know it may be difficult to resist, but some day you will not even consider your friend.
you cannot; it is in our nature to have a wandering eye.
as for me, i appreciate an honest man.
or, does he need to get himself in order?
i recommend that you choose someone else, friend; she is a "playa."
some people are not most people. i cannot agree with you.
it is your choice, but i would say yes, if he is an attractive man.
men and women differ in the way they think and feel.
either he likes you and he's a stalker, or there's something wrong with his eyes
if you are a real friend you will forget about that man.
do they enjoy being babied?
that information is everywhere so you can search for sex education on your computer.
i do not like to be a mean friend but have you lost your mind?
answer me if you want to become my friend?
i could be wrong about both, and i probably am.
i am one, and i know many more.
i know you are not trying to seduce, but you understand.
then you recover and meet someone else who will hurt you.
if he knows and does't have a girlfriend, then your to shy.
all guys say they'll never cheat.
i have had a relationship with a boy lately.
well i think you should ask him?
so, if he's smart, he won't.
if you can't get them to moan, use something to help.
i look for a man who is confident but not egotistical.
be honest, and be yourself and people with take notice.
good luck, let me how it goes!
save yourself money and pain, acquire a parrot.
let another do it in your palce.
if you are truly interested in this man, approach him and talk.
well, if you begin now and plan out the future of you and your baby, then you will be set.
especially given i could best them in dodgeball!
what are the signs and what should i worry about?
who cares, so what if they are playing?
see, two can play at that game!
perhaps you should ask your mother!
if you use a telephone, then it is like stalking.
in the event things do not work out you will be in.
men who play with love do not love themselves.
tell him he is overweight, ugly, and penis is huge like mine.
it rocked my socks off.
it will never completely go away.
if you are really good friends, do not do it.
i prefer long, but no longer than shoulder length.
i really love the father of my baby and want to get back together with him.
you will know which girl is right for you when the time is right.
leave things as they are, not too near or far, in the end they will all work out.
it is, however, all about the proposal.
if not, then take someone else on a date next time.
it is occasionally, but do not doubt until you catch the other person. then you will know.
it is definitely not just men.
hello, friend. i thought you were six years old but you already have a girlfriend, correct?
once a person is unfaithful, they will remain that way.
sex is very serious and you should be patient.
if it is bothering her, you should stop!
i have not cheated on any of my significant others.
not all mean cheat on their significant others.
you should just tell her to trust you. i recently had a similar situation!
instead of wasting your time with unintelligent questions.
it must be scary for a shy individual.
why would someone be attracted to someone who's rude to them?
i'm not joking, when my wife cleans the house, and states she loves me. i want her.
the majority of young ladies will double cross you for a man.
i was wondering what different individuals feel guilty concerning.
five years is a sufficient amount.
it's too long, if you pull, it will hurt.
i concentrate on sex, when i'm having it.
you're unable to buy a golden ticket.
your first approach is to stay calm, and do not let him lower your standards.
it's troublesome that the perception of me is that of a homosexual when i do not identify as one.
males often behave like they are strong and tough.
is there anyone out there who would want to enter a relationship with someone who is not fearless?
it is also not possible to marry your pet dog as well. does that concern you?
men like to play games to convince women to like them.
listen to a group of men talking to one another.
trust in the relationship you have. you know, and she knows as well.
most men have this under control.
yes, you should probably not feel that way.
if you like both then you are bisexual.
perhaps you ought to talk to him when you are around people to begin with.
overall, they can be very attractive in many ways.
if you have not yet removed yourself, do so now.
because women and girls always want men to want them all of the time.
some cannot find contenement and many have commitment problems.
it is good that he was open enough to tell you.
they always lied to me about my partner and it caused a lot of problems.
i am a thirty year old white female and i want to meet someone through the internet, but everywhere i look they only want money.
i would suggest that you keep away from this type of men especially if you are decent with morals.
please do not ruin someone elses life even if you do not care about your own life.
i would like to, sorry, you live too far from me.
that would be like bringing a stranger to a family reunion.
when you do, i hope you will be ready for her.
just tell him if you would like to see him more.
you see, sometimes females say that to see how you will respond.
also, for the unintelligent that assume that all women over thirty sag or droop.
does he put his genitalia in the hard drive?
i am pleased that the two of you reconciled.
however, he was unable to do the same.
why not do so before it is complete?
also, do not get angry and raise your voice when the child does things such as belch.
keep her close, but do not lie to her.
i am confused. i do not know if it is because she was my first love.
i actually prefer bald men.
and then when you are finished, go and live with him.
okay, well,you sound seriously immature and full of yourself.
now why in the world would you want to tolerate that foolishness.
that is why they love older women dear.
i saw her for one night, but i forgot to give her my name and phone number.
what aspects do you find ideal in a woman?
why would you want to do this?
why do guys act in that manner?
you should know the answer to your own question.
possibly she is worried that she could become pregnant or has a similar concern. how you considered that?
it demonstrates to women how the average man thinks.
it will make you feel better.
yes, most likely when no attraction for you remains.
why do you think he may be shy?
i was about to inquire about the same thing.
love and relationship takes work.
will you make a star your husband?
they are a dark indian and is interested.
i am wondering if she cheated on you, or if it was you who cheated on her.
is he very - how to say this - "geeky"?
my goodness - where is your self-respect?
i am sorry - no, you cannot be friends and still have a clear conscience.
i am adorable, petite, and lovable - even a little old-fashioned.
but then i recalled something my father had told me.
i could never become more sexually attractive because then i would be jealous of myself.
they have a child together but they were not involved that way when i first met him.
also, men are unintelligent. i mean no offense.
ask him out or just ignore him.
and you would do anything for that particular person.
since you are a man, there really is not any too ugly.
just tell her the same way you told us.
wait a couple of years after you are married.
the answer is no.
there is also improve theater and it is wildly entertaining.
one of my close friends discovered that one of our best friends has romantic feelings for her.
it really is very dependent on how mature they are.
you should ask her why she gets upset at you dating.
if you're active, just tone it down a bit.
as long as she doesn't physically abuse you.
don't return to him.
make sure he's the right person, and if he is, then don't hold back!
she would enjoy talking about herself.
you should simply ask him. if he does not answer, continue asking until he does respond.
women like these are difficult to find.
i urge you to ask him!
tell me what is good about the relationship.
not long in the same way as a woman's hair may be long.
it varies on what you favor and what your age is!
we just want to be civil.
what should i do because he states he did not cheat, but i do not believe him!
maybe when you two are joking around you should ask him, imagine if we dated?
yes, you can; but you do not have a girlfriend, and i do not have a boyfriend.
do not strive to find someone who seems to be better than you; they likely are not.
i see; do you like this fellow josh enough to take your time and wait for him to act?
[chopper] sometimes he would be there all day and night, and not even speak to me.
why do men have to behave so primitively?
where you do not mke a fool of yourself and both of you have had fun!
question your friend about what kind of male she/he likes.
he may not feel comfortable.
additionally, men are known to become defensive when they are hiding something.
if he tells you no and then goes soft-bingo.
the end of a relationship almost always ends with somebody getting hurt,
that is something i would like to know.
go after the man if you want him.
i have experience with marriage and suggest caution.
age does not mean anything to me.
you should not feel sorry, instead focus on finding a good man.
in a paradoxically serious, yet joking manner.
you can inform him that we have helped to educate you.
i am not condoning being unfaithful.
can men really not tell the difference between being nice and flirting?
yes, that is what boys want; but i guess you were not asking what men want.
have fun and forget about him; you gave me the answer about blondes, and i am a brunette!
takes not if you need to!
that is it, just a good lover in the bedroom.
i agree with that answer: if you think about it, women wait for a very long time.
boys want someone who looks good, is nice and caring, and is not shy.
love her, and most importantly: be proud of yourself.
when you have sex you feel heated up.
that depends on what kind of vibrator you have.
say, "listen, woman, if i cannot have you alone, then i will have you both."
the first girl i asked on a date rejected me. since then i have been in this condition.
there are no awkward questions about coitus.
do not misunderstand me, it is not easy, but that is not bad.
give him an ultimatum: you or his mother. if he chooses his mother, you should be glad to be rid of him.
you cannot tell the authorities about him/her because that would not be right. you are his/her best friend.
you are engaged to marry a man who had the same problem previously.
they are not men when they do not do that.
do not get drunk or anything like that.
even people living in the 1990's were able to find love.
hello my name is joshua and i am in nigeria.
do not send him your letters because he will burn them!
boys with confuse you with lies.
you should go out somewhere fun after she is dressed as long as she wants to.
that is why i divorced him.
that is very true for all men.
or is she messing with my head?
i do not believe that there is only one person out there for you.
no, stay with him forever and ever.
so blame it on most of the fathers, but not all of them.
i suppose you appear physically pleasant an are superior at procreation.
that is not a hindrance, simply delay until the proper one arrives, they can be found!
correct, since you do not desire any romantic perception that lead to intercourse.
i despise knowing what you are going to dictate hereafter.
girls like for men to hint at it but i would like to just walk up and tell him.
they are often fearful that the male will be scared off.
don't let him ruffle your feathers.
if you feel that you are that close, you should go out with him soon.
enter a chat room and find friends to chat with about this.
try not to grab, but it's not a really big deal if you do
put soap, vinegar, or nail polish remover on your thumb.
that is only my opinion and others may add to it.
maybe not right after they cheat, but some time down the road.
you have act it out though.
they were only going to be married because she was pregnant.
he sounds rude, you are more important than some friends.
it is as i say, a fresh start and a new day.
if you love him or feel a spiritual connection, then do not end the relationship.
also, it confirms that you are proud and happy with the one with whom you are in a relationship.
girls get the point across, just not always verbally.
i believe it would be best for you to date someone older.
why would you want to go back to a bad situation?
if you enjoy it, it shouldn't matter to anyone else.
is it something you both are interested in?
i'm completely in love with a woman. i don't feel that it's proper and i'd like advice.
ask him that question. there are situations where it's not a good idea to have sex with someone immediately.
i'm sure you won't be pleased when i say that you aren't old enough.
don't assist him in any way.
multiple times in my life, i've been able to look back and say, "wow, i'm so glad to be alive."
make her understand what she is doing and thinking.
you said he is your friend, therefore it is obvious.
very short hair because it feels nice to rub one's hands over it.
you want women to buy you dinner and then you want nothing sexual to occur?
what if they enter a relationship with each other and he finds out about the other man?
what is it that he or she is looking for?
like nike says, just do it.
i do not know what that means but someone used it above me; wait about ten years.
also, look very interested when she is talking.
do not forget that you have a child.
it depends on how hard you work to get the person you have feelings for to accept you.
my friends always tell me to go talk to him, all i must do is say hello.
please rephrase your question.
most girls focus more on personality, not simply looks.
just give it time.
tell him exactly what you want.
have you asked a girl to lay you?
over him but life goes on ans so will you.
sometimes it is the only action i get.
move on. never follow or stalk him, because it will make him think you are crazy.
although, we never forget our first loves.
perhaps he is waiting for the right time.
it depends on your age.
just ask god. he is not greedy, and will give it to you when the right one comes along.
third, do not pay attention to his cursing and just move on with your life.
next time, ask her for her's.
yes, if you come to me.
try making love to her, instead of just having sex.
no matter where you are, or what you are doing, if she loves you, she will not care.
in a manner that would not hurt anyone.
as for me, i do not kiss on the first date.
look at donald trump and his attractive wife.
handle school first and other matters later.
wait until after two more dates, then if he does not try for it, you must.
they define this behavior as keeping your dating opportunities open.
you should allow me to leave when i desire to leave.
there are many better opportunities in the world for you.
after researching the additional details, i feel that you both have different aspirations in life.
this is only one chicago man's opinion.
then, have someone else give it to him for you.
if asking her out feels awkward, it is because it is.
she thinks that she likes this guy, and suddenly, she gets another crush.
she deserves to be treated like a lady, treasure and be faithful to her.
eighteen is acceptable for girls, twenty-one for guys.
why do people fall in love?
otherwise, it will just get worse.
if you are unhappy in your relationship, tell her.
it is absolutely too soon unless it was love at first sight!
why wouldn't you get attached to someone that you have fantastic sexual chemistry with?
do some of your own flirting now.
do it in a manner that nobody would get hurt in.
most women would like an attractive man.
there are attractive men that will treat you well.
life is hard before you die.
i want to have shelter and a nice job. i would also like to have an unused harley davidson motorcycle.

i am entertaining my self with the answers.  this is something i find funny.
i apologize if i appear to be rude. it is not my intention to appear rude.

i am seventeen and i have really enjoyed the company of this boy for some time now.
well, everyone likes different types of people, you like big behinds, and you cannot lie...
i do really mean that, a great friend who listens intently.
otherwise: love and use, full steam ahead.
i still think it may be a little jump.
well, i can think of a few ways!
ask any elderly person from her family to advise her.
why would a 15 year old like a guy 20 years older than him?
girl, do not get married to catch someone.  it is a big mistake!
you will not be required to have sexual intercourse. nor do you have to consider this a romantic date.
if he agrees, please go ahead and invite him.
be up front and honest, no matter how you decide to approach the subject.
hi, this is richard.  i am very attracted to people of the latin race.  what is the age of a man that you would be attracted to?

females behave like that, so we must tolerate it.
it was quite ironic that he was being unfaithful and then returning to me.
her sister and i were good friends.
if you feel unhappy, you ought to discontinue it.
i would be afraid to be in the company of a homosexual for that reason.

we do not need to feel bad, because remember, "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me" .
it may help if she brings my co workers and friends to assist with the problem, i could use any possible assistance.
yes, i have been called the derogatory b word.
he is displaying his passion for life, as well as his idea of a deity.
i am fully aware that i am not the hottest thing.
what if women wear men's undergarments?
that would be a huge problem.
it makes a good ice breaker.
you may want to drink some whiskey if it is a male.
just because they happen to know french and english?
respect means do not flirt in front of her and do not ever forget that she is your one and only love.
you are definitely a jerk.
boys are horrible at dating in general.
however, some people say it just to say it.
as a male, i can perceive that he indeed loves you.
if you have a child, your life never will be as you plan, not now, nor never.
indeed, you gentlemen genuinely do not obeserve the fine details.
only if you believe that he deeply favors you.
some people would like to be informed.
it was not good because he claimed that you were the one going over.
it may be because women believe they do not deserve any better.
he most likely is not cheating; he is most likely unintelligent.
i have heard enough guys say horrible things about larger women.
you want to kiss someone if you love them.
it is a bad idea to have an office romance.
email or fax her.
go out on a date with someone.
show her that it would be much better for her if she dated you.
offer him your phone number or ask for his.
you are aware of the answer.
there is a simple solution for being single.
i don't that we make our own paths.
just politely walk away from the situation.
do you think you deserve it?
how can anyone know you better than a friend?
when you are ready to have coitus, do it.
either that or all the men with whom you spend time are rude.
tell him he can take his unfaithful self elsewhere.
adjusting to a new culture shouldn't be a problem for you, i believe you will enjoy it.
the first step is to simply ask the person.
i don't believe you vomited.
stretch it out over a few days if you feel that is necessary.
when you aren't seeking it, the right person will appear in your life.
i apologize but i am married.
be confident and tell her you will give the best of efforts.
the internet has become a normal means of communication.
he was my boyfriend and now he is my husband.
i've told her that i want to meet somewhere other than our place of work but that never happens.
have a good attitude around him.
if he was abusive, you should move on instead of getting jealous.
it is not a contagious disease.
you've probably already heard this from others but my advice is to be yourself.
plump women have hourglass figures rather than a straight shape like men.
if you focus on it overmuch, you'll only fuel her drive.
how about striking her in the face!
come on - you can do it!
i recommend speaking up and saying there's something wrong.
i know how it feels to have a broken heart and it is not easy.
she said of course there is.
tell him to go to the local strip club.
you d not tell her to lose weight.
my friends are encouraging me to move on, but i am unsure about it.
she ended the relationship 2-3 days ago.
he is using you, do not fall for his games.
if you are in a committed marriage, i reccommend meeting a therapist because living with a cheater is very difficult.
i am not joking, she is over there.
i think she was scared to be on her own.
simply choose activities that she enjoys doing.  the activities don't need to be expensive, just choose them without boasting about what you are doing.
they do not want to cause you hurt feelings.
you urgently need to discuss this with the man.
hello.  my name is ______.
these w positives give you no access to the television so that you can watch gay sexual interactions.
you won't know what you are missing if you do not try.
you never know until you ask her out.
i suggest you could wait for it or place a hold on it.
she needs to sign this and get her life together.
don't worry, i've been with my own man for 3 years and he always forgets!
i think he likes you but is just afraid to enter a relationship.
i could not do that because of my shyness.
i say to you both: congratulations!
unless it's someone disgustingly wealthy - like bill gates.
take your time.
she is not the only woman that said that to her
her and her boyfriend just had their fourth child.
what you said is somewhat true.
how do you know if your man is cheating?
the individual acts like a buffoon due to the fact that he desires his dessert while also consuming it.
my activities do not include writing a blog or visiting the myspace website, but individuals i'm acquainted with who do do those things are made of shit.
if you have genuine love for him, then i would, when in private, caress his phallus.
have not been familiar with friendster. i use myspace and xanga.
merely a week ago my significant other and a selection of friends departed town for a business project.
that would be fantastic.
yes, it does work. try it.
you should break up with him, if he can't even trust you to go out with your friends.
he stated they're no longer together.
he might not only like you as a acquaintance, perhaps something more.
i do not condone it, but, love away.
a whole 360 degrees, and we were together for one year.
one on each side, we were really going at it.
you two will be just  fine, do not worry about it buddy.
so, do not see the person for their shortcomings or faults.
i do not want children to not have a father.
the fact remains that you are researching through yahoo.
i say this only because most people do not fall in love after getting married.
i do no want things between myself and her to get lost.
men want what they cannot have.
in addition, he wants to look around.
they stop calling as much as he stops calling you by your nickname.
however, if he's hunky or very smart he may be too enthusiastic and not truthful.
if you like to eat something that takes like carpet, go out.
i understand how the young girl may not want you around her father.
also, he can do what he wants to and it is all good.
talk to her, ask her out and pick her up unexpectedly.
that is a hard one and i do not know what you should do.
just go and tell him upfront.
russian and most other foreign women are generally great companions, especially if they have been rescued from a harsh environment.
since you came to me for advice, just listen to what i said.
if i lost my daughter i could not live with out her!
it is funny how my girlfriend found me on yahoo.
why is it not a big deal for you to see a woman crying?
you need to get sexual advice from a pornographic movie.
i'm interested, but unfortunately i'm not pretty. are you?
you should give it to him as a present, at the least he'll know you like him.
i'm attracted to a man, i don't want to inform him, because he's seeing someone else.
it's not for me. i'm unsure what to do.
will she return the love is the question?
your needs can be met if you work hard.
does this have anything to do with a man?
she thinks i do not let her say her desires.
she smiled at me and left.
i have done that before.
i believe if you listen closely and let her speak, things will go better in the future.
if you first fall in love, the sexual component will come naturally later.
similarly to you, i had always liked her, but things did not occur spontaneously or immediately.
he does not go to bed with you any longer?
i love him very much and my ignorant friends were very thoughtless in leaving he and i alone together.
you are not obligated to do anything you are not inclined to do.
but proceed slowly and simply.
use words such as "imagine," "what if," "dream," and "vision."
when it is on a guy that can pull it off, it is great!
it is because you attract the wrong types of guys.
most of the girls i know do not blame the guy like that unless he cheated on her or something.
because most men end the relationship after two days being scared of commitment!
if not, best of luck to you in your educational journey!
meny teens begin their sexual experimentation at this age. it's better to start while you're young.
go to turkey in the yahoo messenger chat room and join it.
no one knows seth.
because he is not me.
you have to have courage and tell him how much you love him.
he will either show up or he he won't.
ask me some other time.
come over and i will help you figure it out.
stop being lazy and ask for the truth.
do they want a relationship or sex?
what is the sense of saying something everyday, if in reality you did not mean it?
do not do that.  evidence will be splattered all over the damn place!
i hope you find the one who makes you smile.
sometimes, it takes a little time to meet the right guy.
do you think it is all in my head?
flirt with every good looking guy you meet.
this way, i try not to hurt her.
do handsome men consider dating women their own again?
that is the funny thing about love.
a few things to think about.
wow, aren't you at the age you should be having children soon?
you should put potted meat in the bathtub then jump in when you lover gets home, it'll be funny,
depending on your sexual preference, it would be your wife or husband.
he will be concerned what happened to you.
next time you should persuade him to leave a hicky in a spot your parents can't see it.
lead the charge and right away ask her if she'll have you for life.
throw a party to lift your spirits.
her name is olivia. i'm terribly jealous.
let him have one dollar and ask him to book a plane to france.
don't let it bother you, there's a guy out there for you.
that is what they do and think.  in other words, they like action not words.
i will be glad to give you my best help in every matter.
it takes more to make a lot of noises.
damn, i have got a life too!
guys who have casual sex are considered sluts by many girls.
your life is not worth his need for sex.
focus on our brain.
he is in my left pocket and hanging out with two nuts.
if he says he loves you and is staying with you, then he really does love you.
i have never heard of that.
if you chance upon two, inform me.
second romantic encounter? indeed, a kiss is appropriate.
well, i suppose seeing as you are a filipino working abroad, correct?
disgusting, i cannot imagine somebody appreciating such an item.
i believe you should be straightforwar and inform him of your feelings.
there are some women who are not interested in that activity.
do you feel closer to one of them in particular?
you are not the only person who has those feelings.
you sound like a really nice person and possibly too nice.
you are making a big mistake and should consider your family.
yes, it is legal, however it is not ethical.
kiss him and declare your love for him.  in addition, stay true to your identity!
also, be certain that you cease if she instructs you to.
i believe that this would not cause any harm.
i do not associate with them often.
has this event ever occurred to anyone else?
most men don't mind if you have a small amount, but don't go overboard.
we parted ways, but we remain close.
when it goes beyond what you can stand.
you are interested in him, what does it matter?
tell him you want to enter a more serious relationship.
if he asks, then tell him yes.
you should continue to respond with "no".
you're correct; however, once the relationship begins with him, she will regret her decision.
that will depend on your request. you were not very specific.
i do not believe so, unless you consume twinkies during.
that person will continue to notice you forever.
he will simply inform you that you aren't his mother.
you are aware of how to handle this agent21257
ok, do i have this right, no breathing, thinking or moving?
for me, it is when i say to you that i love you.
if your boyfriend cares about you, he will move slowly and make sure you are comfortable.
you'll spend far more time going up than you will going down.
i would guess that it is something you would just feel.
if she was in a relationship when you broke up, it isn't something you should do, wait and it will happen again.
i don't understand how people fall in love.
you will find yourself in a troublesome position.
retain pleasant relations with the pair, should they separate, at that point consider requesting a date with her.
personally, i prefer a faithful woman who's attractive and somewhat intelligent.
lol, excellent query. i would travel to my place of my employment.
getting married ... the single winner is ... nobody ... method for attaining first place ... be able to scream more audibly
you'd best not even pose this query in non-private places.
it's very typical to be attracted to certain individuals or hold them in high esteem.
respond in the affirmative to all utterances of hers.
do not rely the information to your closest companion since, as a result, your existence will be destroyed.
i reach age 26 in the coming month and i am unable to fathom currently being betrothed.
young ladies, refrain from feeling frightened to respond, in addition to evaluating this query of mine to your entire group.
you should leave, as he is using you and nobody wants to be treated in that manner.
you are being foolish, and you ought to watch an x-rated movie.
it is not as though you asked for his permission when you wished to marry someone else.
perhaps you are too perfect for them.
i may chat with you and make a humorous remark, but in my case, it is all in jest.
i met my wife online.
if you go for it, it will make him want you even more!
unfortunately, this means that he is not really into you and that you are just a time filler.
help, i'm going to marry this man but i do not think i can stay in the marriage forever.
i do not really know because i have the same problem.
to miss a special one and think about them all the time, means i am in love.
these guys do not know each other.
i am not a boy.  i guess they do, if you know what i mean!
do not let others hate on people, because they are not like you and me.  get it!
the person will understand and leave you.
please think of the various items she has mentioned.
this particular guy had expressed interest in me since my freshman year.
who is seth and does he attend rochester high school?
i just responded to another one of your queries.
there is no apparent reason why, i would suggest you just stick with the answer, "no".
yes there will be some paid and you will feel a lot of pressure.
this is the strangest question i have ever heard anybody ask. ask her.
the items i seen were gorgeous!
why do you want her to have an orgasm quickly? it's better to take your time with her and she will enjoy it.
that is the deal the stump gets.
both of you need to discuss this with your spouse,  and i would advise you to get married.
mini carrots are super clean vegetables,  and are very healthy for you.
alright, i really like this guy.
how would that work if my most important tool is only less than 15cm?
may i ask what your name is?
no, boys i am familiar with are not fond of girls going there.
i have a question, where would you take a lady?
you should hang white lace over a four poster bed an include lots  of pillows.
i don't have a definative yes or no answer for you.
she believes she will be unlovable.
for now, just try to keep yourself happy and have lots of fun while you finish high school.
it sounds like something that is simple.
i can offer what i always do, hugs and kisses.
all women are special, you just need to find what makes you special.
i strive to be honest.
i think it is too soon for you to make it.
she may feel that she needs access to your money.
leg attire with the seam in the back, can be a very hot, sexy conservative option.
never go into a relationship, if the relationship, seems too good to be true.
it has not happened yet, as i am still waiting for the right man.
action speaks lounder than words.
you can get what you want by leaving him or her alone for some amount of time.
you should ask why a person would get married if they do not trust a person.
i have a friend who dates a new man each week.
if you are happy, you can become satisfied that way.
clean shaven if your abdominal muscles are well conditioned, or if you are not merely obese.
i believe i am in love with this man, but i am not positive.
yes, you may if she is not already in a relationship.
you increase the pressure. you are the man. inform her that she will simply have to abjure clothing.
it is very clearly demonstrated, and yet they still will not put it in words!
now i am in a new relationship and i fear that the same thing will happen once more.
wait until you are twenty-four, nineteen is too sudden.
this will cause indifferences between you and your betrothed.
it is difficult, but you need to move on.
give up on it and release it.
who cares if you are gay or straight as long as you are a good person?
what does it say about her, if she runs away when she is unable to say, "no," to the kids?
you said you love her wholeheartedly.
does a big mac cost about $2.00 us here?
similar to myself, a closeted bi-sexual male.
don't attach yourself to the first person that comes along.
i am not poking fun at the question.
is there anyone here who is thirty, from india an looking for a serious relationship?
at the moment, it sounds like a nice plan to me.
what would you think if she flirted with other men?
when it is the totality of your thoughts.
if her boyfriend pursues you and you cannot divert it no matter the effort.
saying "i am sorry to tell you that i do not think we are compatible." would be a good response.
if you do, give him your telephone number.
i am 30 and so i certainly do have an opinion on this.
because most disloyal men put on pretenses and lie frequently and, unfortunately, women are attracted to that.
but you are too young and he is young as well.
but she would not leave the house.
do you sincerely understand what love is?
if a woman is aware that you are married, she will most likely not be comfortable with you flirting with her.
correct. i was married to him. i did not like him; however, i still had sex with him.
who believes that heavy-set latinas with long, brown hair are sexy?
women do not function in that manner.
i do not believe so, as he married kim.
he only wants me to change to fit his needs.
if you want it to, it can do it.
put it behind you and put more focus on school.
do you know who he is?
i know longer want to be with him.
he told me that he would like to have his guy friend join us when we have sex.
spank him for being naughty.
what would it be like to be dead?
be honest with him, that is the best course of action.
and while they remain on the ground.
and what if you gain weight even after the first time?
that is a wasteful question.
the answer varies.
it is all dependant on weather you are male or female.
based on my personal experience, it is leo, libra, aquarius, aries, and gemini, no others.
to quote oprah, she should drop the zero and find a hero.
i didn't think we were hiding.
you shouldn't be asking that.
this will be your last date.
this is my favorite part!
how do you know if a guy is obsessed?
do you fantasize about other women?
even if it's the child of the molester himself.
should i choose the man who adores me, or the man i adore?
a hotel room seems a little cheap and frivolous. i'd prefer my own bedroom.
just pretend you never told anybody.
you probably should listen to her!
does he play around with you as if you are a friend or is he flirting with you?
if they do not, do not bother with them.
simply use your imagination!
use time along to see if you are really suited for each other.
he says he loves me, too.
do not keep your tongue to yourself.
why not, if you like it.
or, if you are too nervous, see if you all could play some one-on-one at some time.
when i can forget about it all is when it is wonderful.
however, we usually have one time per day and on the weekend we have two or three times per day.
pinch him really hard and then pinch the day prior to your next birthday.
tell your sister to do something for you and to make your friend leave you alone.
because it is fun and rewarding.
call my cellular phone and we will have a spring wedding, okay?
behave as you normally would and if they do not like it, then leave them be.
you are both adults, so the question is: what is wrong with you?
and you will most likely bleed some, but you will be fine. it will get better.
if you do not mind me posing the question. you simply have not yet met the correct one.
simply go out and enjoy yourself, have a free dinner and if anything should happen then it will be good.
have a conversation and allow them the first five to ten minutes to speak.
allow her to feel that you care about her feelings. for us, that is more important than you can imagine.
or, perhaps, merely act as if you are.
it is very good. now you have found your best friend and you will always be friends.
you should continue to like him because you cannot know if he might invite you on a date.
in general, the same as you.
that is the problem with your question.
you do not know what type of mentally unstable people exist.
i wish you the best of luck and hope it works out for you.
if they have no reply for the argument, you win.
you will find points to validate your argument.
the answer is really simple, ask your girlfriend to marry you.
i apologize, i don't mean to be so inquisitive, some of these answers are retorical.
you have to wonder about how much he really cares.
everything about them.  personally, i prefer the waist, stomach and behind.  goodness.
when you understand the difference between lust, infatuation, and true love.
i also got jealous when my ex-boyfriend started going out with my friend.
there is more to life than that kind of stuff.
you just have to do it.
meaning that your television or your radio will not play without a negative and a positive.
they came back much later.
please stay away from this girl.
there was a guy i was with who would always make me excited and i would be ready to have sex...but he would back off.
many guys like a girl with curves.
but, he is getting married this month.
which do type of guy do you prefer: one with a beard, a mustache or without facial hair?
first and foremost, never try to be something that you are not. keep in mind, you've got something to offer.
go to college, but do not forget to keep in touch on breaks and weekends. you can do so via telephone or internet, but get your education!
the cost of the transaction was less than one hundred dollars.
to decide what is the next point of action, we should flip a coin.
if you feel like you might even have a little bit of feelings towards her, you should ask to take her out without other people.
i love my significant other who is a malicious male.  this is because men like him are lustfully attractive, sexually enlightened, adventurous, and utterly enjoyable.
why did you do something negative to a woman to cause her life to be hard?
i am still looking very overworked in the dating department.
it sounds as if you are a great place for him to stop in.
i find women with large breasts attractive.
there is no difference unless you are a teenager.
you should know, i don't work, so that could affect kicking him out.
or, video communicate so that we may be able to see each other.
do not wait until she has tarnished your image.
however, i notice him gazing at me every so often.
in my previous relationship, my paramour was unfaithful to me.
jerry, jerry, jerry, place him into submission.
and please think about your man - i am sure you do not wish to hurt him.
i've just come to terms with that, myself.
if you like him, there's no shame in being with him.
don't sweat the small stuff. just focus on trying to be the bigger person.
he comes home any time he pleases.
you can download it from one of the websites listed below.
kissing him will reveal everything.
there is no clear answer to love.
i am well endowed, i am single, your secret is safe with me, i haven't been intimate with a woman's petals, and i love you.
my ex is a girl as well, so what are my options?
a person's sexual orientation does not define them.
exercising power can be a great way to release all that energy.
have a good time but be smart.
i had the idea to send photos of her to maxim magazine.
they have a poor memory when it comes to remembering dates.
it's possible she thinks that she won't find someone else.
you may want to try ignoring him for a day and then being nice to him the following day.
you should review the browser history on the computer.
if you give him some love i'm sure he will appreciate it.
that is what women occupy themselves with there.
certainly, i am in awe of ample bottoms.
you should request your boyfriend go slightly lower next time you attempt it.
you should try taking a risk.
you should take me to a concert by one of my favorite artists, something simple and not high maintenance.
it is all dependent on how he does it.
when men are in the mood, they don't waste time. simply get naked and engage in sex.
when you find you are ready to move forward, there are lots of good people.
pressuring me actually makes me sweat.
with a large number of men interested in you, you should be flattered.
you cannot assist them. they need to help themselves.
she is my sister's best friend, and she has romantic feelings towards one of my friends.
it may help you when choosing a gift to put yourself in a feminine mindset.
risks are difficult, but you still have to put effort in.
if you are meaning to leave, you can not.
follow up and speak with this same person at a later time.
life is what you make of it, let the boys drool over you.
i don't doubt you love him, but 80 years is a large commitment to make.
my family and friends claim i always speak what is on my mind.
it does not hurt if the man doesn't insert his penis roughly.
the woman is probably lying to you, cheating on you, and probably doesn't even exist.
eventually he will get caught; start saving your own money now.
you should find someone that you can date in person, not just online.
you were talking about that kind of balls, correct?
that is the way i ended up being with my girlfriend, and it has lasted for four years.
do not get tied down or committed, because male friends are more important than girls.
that was rather staid, but be careful.
using moderation, such as matching a pink dress shirt with jeans, would look nice.
you can not make someone fall in love with you.
men and women work differently, but i believe you were already aware of that fact.
just spend time playing with it and you will figure it out.
you have no control over who you fall in love with.
does anyone have any fresh ideas on how to keep a marriage fresh?
i don't find any problems with it.
you should not waste you time on him.
you should remind yourselves what you both found fun and sexy in the beginning.
that is a fake question, right?
not only are you lazy, but you are unintelligent as well.
it is also possible that i would like to be closer to you than we are at the moment.
i may be able to help you.
it sounds like you do not want it to end this way.
if she does not agree, respect her decision and let her be.
this issue does not include her mom, only you and her.
i have met him already, but i am not certain if we are meant to be together.
that moment when you cannot stop thinking about him/her.
it could, but, most likely not at all, because both of you are very young.
do not rush imto telling nd te him that you love him.
please help a friend out.
the problem is i am interested in this man but i think this woman is nice.
if this man is good at coitus, then he will satisfy you in other ways.
the word is "insist." no, you are thinking of incest, and that is only if you are related, not a friend's cousin.
forget about him. enter a relationship with me and i swear i will never end it.
although it will be difficult, in the long run it would be better for you to move past this.
at this time, only those with constructive answers should address this question.
please restrict your reading to our answers only.
while it may seem foolhardy, it works very well.
well, it is not incorrect in any way.
bad boys are edgy and are not boring. but i am not saying that many good guys are boring either.
when they are wearing all pink, it looks flamboyant.
first date, all the way.
your eyes can say more than your words ever could.
you sound like an idiot, you should do nothing.
it is up to your boyfriend to tell her.
you should simply walk up and inform her of the facts.
if you decide to do it you should video it.
you should do so rather than interrupt her.
i personally believe that men will have sex with anything.
whether or not you are engaged on this does not make any difference in defining you as "hotter," my friend.
nothing is amiss. but please refrain from flirting conversation and showing so much interest with a date.
however, in the confines of your residence or in the public lawn, then feel the freedom.
in addition, it is not imperative that you stand for that treatment.
sometimes appearances have much significance as well.
you ought to anticipate the most winning parts of your own self.
no, every individual is unique. you have no ability to control your essential nature. that's simply reality!
through the action of interfacing with a different person - a more superior person ideally...
i'm attempting to obtain a quantity and my female child is consistently conscious.
you are unable to. however, all i am knowledgeable about is that your only option is become romantically entangled, then become betrothed.
the most important factors are health, love and how sweet the couple are to one another.
i think the best course of action is to do what you are told to do.
my plan is to rent it out once she is finished moving out.
in french you say "je t'aime", and in spanish i believe is it "te amo" or "yo quiero", though i am not certain.
if you can wait a little longer, i think everything will work out in the end.
those women may be able to land any man they want, but they are only interested in girls.
you should keep in mind that there will always be more options, it is much easier said than done.
are you informing your best friend like he is?
in order to give a well informed answer, we will need more information.
you should move slowly and most of all, have fun.
you really need to focus on saving not only your life, but the two women involved.
you won't hear about it until it's the weekend.
when you are married, it will pay off when both you and your husband appreciate your body.
from someone who is a native of new jersey, seventy to seventy two degrees temperature is normal.

he went back to her without telling me and then she finally confessed.
do not think about it, just do it.
reply with, "look, you are a nice person, but i do not think we are right for each other."
you should not do it- it is just a drain on your time.
no, she will only mistreat you.

i was wrong  to end the relationship.
how do you handle that?
i am very angry with my best friend.
you should recover the ring.
because he is frightened of commitment.
from my own past experience, i would offer that my former boyfriend has not recovered from it and it has made matters worse.
if i am merely dating the person then it seems to be acceptable. if you find out, please inform me. i wish you luck.
perhaps he is disturbed because someone likes him.
despite the fact that i still critique them, lovingly, about his age.
do not believe anyone. no one in this world is perfect.
or you may want to tell her things that she is interested in hearing.
it would be best to move on from this person and find a good person.
the one answer i agree with is that you cannot tell if she is talented at prentending.
i am not inconsiderate; i just have not found a man that i am attracted to in some time.
it never works when i try to play to the crowd.
i want a handsome man who treats me well.
it's better to have an enjoyable experience.
she can eith deny or accept your request.
it was the dumbest question i have ever read.
hot, fast, and prolonged extra heavy duty things are happening.

give him a hug on the first date and only kiss him if you know him.
don't let it absorb you and you will be fine.
could you please go to the dictionary and look up "moil" for me.
tell her not to something risky like that ever again.
if you don't do it, someone else will.
on the first date give him a hug but if you really know him well then a kiss is fine.
if you don't make it your priority you will be okay.
look up the definition of moil in the dictionary.
you should tell her never to take such risks.
i feel this way about my previous significant other.
she replied and is attempting to make it seem as if this is my fault.
why is this the first thing that i go for?
work your way up slowly.
talk to more people even if they are not goth.
how do i get him to approve of me?
how do you tell if a girl likes you?
that is not only a lack of respect, but a lack of wisdom.
i must go there to purchase some shoes.
are we speaking of something similar to a tan?
at the least, there is sex, while it continues.
simply ignore her and do not be concerned.
i think that it would be erotic.
we have not spoken to one another for some time and it is unfortunate.
what kind of music do you listen to to set the mood?
i would not place any blame on him because men tend to behave that way.
this will be difficult.
many women believe that their significant other is unfaithful, even though that may not be the case.
that should be fine, as long as you do not get pregnant.
try asking again. if she gives you the same answer, continue asking her why.
you will know once you feel it in your heart that that is him.
change the way you think about things; that is probably why she ended the relationship.
i would say hello to you to laugh, but i would say, wow that is interesting.
please do not try to push her.
if that does not get the ball rolling, you might need to move on.
when you tell her something, listen to her and be sincere.
there are times when she is upset and needs to vent but that understandable.
it would be a good idea to think about seeking medical care.
not taking responsibility as a man should.
that question isn't necessary at just this moment.

it would be a good idea to avoid them.
don't let them show disrespect to others.

if you love him, do your best to make him happy.
my friend did that and she was miserable.
it is fine to some but not to others.
looks do not always last but personality does.
check if there are any wrong actions that you may not realize before you complete it.

i dated someone for three years and we're friends now.
do you ever stop loving someone who broke your heart?
i cared for him deeply but in the end i knew it wasn't what i wanted long term.
it is like she does not care for our friendship anymore; why is that?
yes, and when you least expect it.
be yourself that is what i do.
i hope your friends are good friends.
or, should i ask her to marry me before college, and then get married during or after college?
it is fun to get a gift like cigars even if the man does not prefer them.
you should proceed if he is attractive and courteous.
as long as you let them both know, you can date each of them and determine which one you like better.
it is improper to have sex before marriage.
if he is already good looking, what matters most is his personality.
using your legs is better than using your back.
she is not a psychic after all.
of course, you should ask her out on a date if you think you love her.
however, it could be different for you.
i am infatuated with women who are latina, they are very attractive.
please clarify.  do you mean they cheat on their wives?

best of wishes in your life.
if you watch the film garam masala, you will get your answer.
look for subtle hints; but do not wait too long to tell her how you feel about her.
the guy who lives next door to me is nice, funny, and almost perfect.
i feel nobody can trust my ex-husband, even the girls around him now.
ask yourself the direction the relationship is going in.
my boyfriend is bisexual, so, my sex life is non-existent.
it's easy if you want to become one.
i am comfortable with who i am.
after coffee, walk somewhere interesting where there will be many things to talk about.
stand up for yourself and say it.
or are you not doing it right?
i needed to hear a good joke.
if they tried to explain i would listen but of course they would have do something for me in return.
you must be brave and talk to her.
you can get an erection from any naked girl, but if your love for her keeps it up.
i believe you know the answer to this question, miss!
do not tempt this situation as it could degrade into a catastrophe.
my wife and i require our privacy. alas, that should be sufficient.
indeed, there were merely light kisses, but quite significant nonetheless.
the easiest manner in which to deeply destroy your life is to marry for monetary means.
you will discover a male to love you as long as you love him.
tell her what you love about her.
maybe you are asking the wrong question.
it was only an internet romance but we both felt as if we were falling in love.
you know what you like and you know what you dislike.
i suppose that you should put yourself in his shoes.
let's address the first matter of concern: is he even looking?
what is the worst that could happen?
men are not a game that you play for fun and prizes.
if you are certain, go ahead.
my friend, you should avoid them because they are not the ones who you have a relationship with.
if you do not want the husband present, then you want something different and that is simply wrong.
he would speak to me last year but will not this year.
when you cross your eyes it is four although normally it is two.
i am certain that it is as that was my experience.
however, she is dating the person you are interested in, yes?
think of it this way: would you buy a car without a test-drive first?
wow, this girl can't even vote yet!
if it is a rare occurence, just online and no texting, i think it is acceptable.
and never do it again!
there is a place where there are crowds of beautiful women.
she was saying, "yes".
i apologize, be more careful in the future.
when i was a teen, i discovered that it actually worked the other way.
i am not agreeing that it is alright, you also need to respect your spouse.
if he does not remember, he is likely perverted and asks many women on dates.
he is a gentleman and would never say hey, go away!
i would suggest that you pull his arms over your shoulders as if you were attempting to give him a piggy back ride.
what is so wrong with calling them that?
that is five years, not four.
if she was just playing hard-to-get, then try again later,
if she's worth it, she will.
because if it's what i think, then this would be a racist question.
i was her high school sweetheart and she was younger than me.
i prefer not to be called that on a daily basis, especially around others.
it might or might not save your marriage
i will be pleased if he says yes.
there is a chance this will result in gang wars among other things.
i am told that i have qualities desirable in a best friend.
a gentleman does not treat a woman badly.
when i was five years old, it was the girl next door.
there is bound to be someone that you are close to that you are not noticing.
i am upset, however, i am not going to talk negatively against you.
i hope you follow, is she a taurus?
men are not the only ones that do that.
you only live once.
it is similar to the "battered wife syndrome".
try asking him if he wants to spend all of his time with you.
usually guys do not talk about girlfriends or girls that they like.
if you want it to only be for her, treat her to a head to toe spa treatment.
everyone has summed it up perfectly, i agree.
also try the anal beads, which can go in front or back.
think about jelly when you see her.
i need advice on discipline?
yes, he will want to sleep because he works a lot.
it's better to let him know now than to lead him on.
she may be feeling the same way about you but is scared to tell you, just like you are.
actually, it surprised me how nice he was to me.
would it be worth breaking up with lazarus?
first of all, how old are you?
me?  i am thirty-five years old.
not unless i am instantly struck with cupid's arrow.
if you like her, this will be difficult.
it is a sick habit that people get into.
he should be alright if not, good luck.
have a friend tell him, you get to do the flirting.
be honest with her and ask her to shower.
my mom is where the love is.
here is what the opposition would say.
flowers are a good gift.
he ignored me for a week after we talked.
we live in a free world and who cares.
what should we talk about.
that sounds gay, no offense.
let me get this straight, you asked her to marry you, you then dump her, and now you want the ring back?
do not be afraid to try new things.
no need to be bitter, you are a nice person.
using the "just say no" motto depends on the circumstances.
you should be very proud that he loves you so much.
be creative and use other things; e.g., a feather, ice cube or rose.
does he look at naked women on television, the computer, or in magazines?
what defines the 'girl of your desire?'
even if she does not admit to it, she feels that things are monotonous too.
i discipline them on their bottoms.
what if someone does not want to be married?
it is simple, just say that you would like to date me too.
i would say it is a disincentive.
i think it depends on gender, for a male i would say 14 and for a female i would say 17.
because you are a female, that means that you are also goofy.
i know some individuals who are only interested in the physical aspect of it.
you know, i would just call johnny depp, and see which man she chooses!
do whatever feels right. it will work out either way!
there is no way for you to change that.
most of the men i have dated did not really care about my feelings, or anything like that.
the only thing anyone has to do is keep it simple and direct. that way, no one gets hurt.
i have feelings about some of the choices that i have made.
my first relationship occured when i was thirteen and it lasted for a month.
do not attempt to do too much, she will see that you are a good guy.
you can either call her or meet her in person.
let her see the real you, and she may come to you forthwith.
formerly i remember there were some guys that i really wanted to date.
say, the rich folk usually treat others as if they completely in debt.
whoever pairs up with him, will hurt the other guy.
i would be obliged to keep your diamond engagement ring, so don't expect me to return it, dunderhead !
it is very likely that your friend will start dating that man.
it is very important to be creative.
it matters on how you look at life.
my life is much different at this time.
you will have no doubts in your mind when it is true love.
though, think about it, if he were such a good man then why is he divorced?
have the confidence in yourself!
then they stop, or do not perform oral sex any longer.
is it alright to date a 22-year-old man if i am 25 years old?
there is a boy at school who i really like.

then you call her and you ask if she tried to call you, yet.

instead, talk about him about being the person he wants you to be.

i don't know if he is attracted to me, or if he is just interested in sex.
if he is much older, forget it, but just be clear about it.
first, wear a sexy outfit, (it is better to wear nothing at all)!
and don't decide what is average by looking at pornography.
oh, look at all the greek statues!
did he say yes, or no?
hold her neck with soft hands and kiss her on the back of her ear?
they want to make out with you, maybe even sex and then leave you there for another girl.
though not all, it bugs me to the core.
it all depends on how much you like this guy and how much you know him.
make sure someone records it because it is going to be very funny to watch on tape.
girls seem to get a lot of attention that they do not want.
the issues that come along might end up being bigger than your behind.
she either fell in love with her ex again or you were an extreme jerk.
wait until she falls in love with you, and maybe things will improve from there.
have someone else purchase them for you.
to be blunt the answer is no.
tell him to get a condom.
just see where the pieces fall.
i want to make sure you
i am single although i do have a male friend i can be slightly intimate with.
you will experience emotional distress through any choice you make.
i agree, he will not be aware if you do not inform him.
stupid women are no longer popular so i do not prefer women of low intelligence.
what reason could you have had for this action?
you are not getting that from your boyfriend.
i am not thoroughly inebriated, only slightly.
i do not understand your previous statement.
you cannot give up; you should try different things, but most likely you should be true to yourself.
you will recognize it when you encounter it.
oh, but that's a good one.
leave it alone. there is nothing worse than two women fighting over a man.
do the things you always wanted to but couldn't because you were married.
a man who likes to dress in women's clothing.
yes, the one you have there really does sound like a good one.
romance is a natural act of love.
i feel it, when a guy is looking at me.
i ask my partner, "how do you feel about us."
i called him,but he did not answer.
your positive attitude glows all over you.
you could bring something he likes, like whip cream.
yes, i love my family.
ask your doctor if it is an issue.
a lot of women want someone to hang out, and will support them.
if a woman doesn't accept you because of your social status, she doesn't deserve you.
some men prefer immoral women to good girls.
i am sure that he will enjoy oral stimulation.
if you help her, she will love you more for it.
you really have a chance if you get to know each other.
he would like to have a three-way sexual encounter with another man.
my concern is for after the relationship ends.
his other friends arrived later that night.
have fun making one in any case. i wish you luck.
when she performs fellatio at your demand.
i would let him know what he did wrong.
i reccommend watching a pornographic movie and getting intimate.
he needs to give you space.
i do not understand why a married man would be interested in seeing other women unclothed.
you need to do what you have to.
i feel something attracting me.
you'll get her to shake.
the sooner it's over, the sooner that they can learn to live with it.
for some individuals, it's a matter of will power.
i prefer bump and grind, and bubble pop electric, dance styles.
men do not understand how lucky they are.
a girl i used to know and i would often play this.
if he wants to spend time with you, it is probably that he is interested in you.
unfortunately, not when someone is looked over.
to any woman, regardless of physical appearance.
you should simply ask her.
it depends on a lot of things. the older, the more there are complications.
it is okay for your husband to watch sports with nagging?
do you love and does he love you in return?
do not forget the highly sensitive area between nus and testicles.
unless you are a bad person, you should just be yourself.
do not taste that which you cannot spell.
yes, it is alright if you have feelings for your former partner.
i have no clue about this person's identity.
flirt with him and do something he wants to do.
without a doubt, it is definitely the child.
if you want to find free activities in your city, check the city's website for festivals and picnics.
maybe he does not want to do something that he is not interested in or feels he is not successful in doing.
i sense that you are selective in who you want to kiss.
i wonder where she is in her life right now.
if he's in love with you, he'll wait.
did you two have sex?
i've been attracted to him since sixth grade. now we're in tenth.
you need to start, by ceasing communications.
my weight varies now, unfortunately, i never was fit again.
if you're quite sufficiently acquainted with him, then make an attempt, young lady!
i believe he may have larger concerns (pardon the wordplay) other than your derriere.
the majority of females won't initially be the sexual aggressor, which is no indicator of a lack of desire on her part.
and should it conclude without romantic attraction on your part, terminate the relationship.
i've filled the role of the unfaithful person as well as the person being two timed.
love is blind, but it sure seems to find its way around!
i think it is more important to us than to men anyway!
it is really normal to think of him and love because you just do.
i need some help. do not misunderstand me though. he looks good.
you are her friend. you need to tell her.
my sister is marrying someone she met online.
inform him that you love him.
if you truly love him, it will work itself out.
good luck in the real world.
i bought this to help ease his mind, and it works.
be very careful because you do not know who you are talking to most of the time.
personal loans could be a good idea, otherwise, well borrow.
and, tell her how beautiful she is.
in my opinion, you are lucky you have found your mister.
do not do it honey. you will kill your spirit by doing that and you should forget him.
you are a home wrecker and should be nervous.
you have been looking at porn.
love can make you or break you.
do not change, because a guy might not like you.
should i tell my ex about this?
i already went out with him, but i really want to get back together.
this is kind of a given, babe.
oh my, that man is just way too attractive.
you love the person for who he is and not who you want him to be.
if you all are not able to be a couple then you can be friends.
tell him something nice about himself.
you may have to move on from the situation.
do you have sex with people you are friends with?
i have close female friends because my wife introduced us.
our friendship has not returned to what it was but we are speaking to each other.
i know that you asked about learning how to kiss.
one of my friends is gay.
i am still searching for a man to love me as i am.
i tapped the girl in front of me and asked her, "hey, do you have a pencil, by chance?"
if he asks you, what is wrong?
so i accused her of doing that.
get it out there before you lose a friend.
i didn't know how to react, so i didn't say a thing.
if he is not ready for a relationship with you then i think you should give him some space.
you should go on one date with this guy and find out whether or not you really do not like him.
if you notice he is flirting past normal for him then you both should to talk.
prove to her that you are a good man that will make for a good husband and father!
i hope you enjoy! just kidding.
i think you should move on.
i want to join, but first i wanted to see what you guys think.
and i am sure he did not propose to your buttocks, right?
the song 'to be with you' by hoobastank.
this is america and we speak english!
it depends on whether young teenagers are allowed to buy condoms.
relationships need more than just sex.  sex can be overrated!
all males want a girlfriend they can be proud of--one who makes their friends jealous.
try to judge the man based on his intentions.
i am a big girl.
she told you it is okay to kiss her?
be loving, caring and most importantly, be natural - be yourself.
the best love is that which helps and makes you overcome the worst.
you do not want any girl with your man.
the stranger cannot judge you because he does not know you well.
i think you should approach him and ask him out.
a hickey is placed in that position so that it will be seen by others.
i am aware that this is difficult, however if you don't begin at this time then when will you begin?
i do not understand why women end up being unfaithful with their true love?
these people always do this even though they sometimes pretend not to.
we can still be friends even though we are not a couple anymore.
do not forget to vote for the one you think is the best
there is nothing wrong with someone getting hurt when it is for love
she would like to see you work for it.

i love kind men. they have a sensitive aspect.
simply choose the public that enjoys it and do not invite those that do not enjoy it.
blondes are wild, that is common knowledge.
that depends, does the person you are interested in have the same feelings.
you cannot do that unless he is interested in you.
some women prefer to be with people who tend to be shy.
it will hurt his feelings very much if you state that you do not love him.
this is because she would like to attend the dance with you.  and perhaps because she is attracted to you.
come right out and inquire if he is going.  if he says he is not, act like a spoiled child who has been denied something they want.
you have to love yourself first or you will not be capable of truly loving anyone or anything else.
as far as he goes, i do not know him.
go see it when you have some free time.
in either case, trust me on this, you will know when you are ready.
it is like a lion tamer taming his lion.
yes, but bigger is not always better.
i am going to have to take you out sugar.
he answered me, "you'll be the loser!".
you should propose, since you want to spend the rest of your life with her.
when it comes to fun, we are easy to understand.
yes, deep down inside they're really looking for a relationship, but they won't admit it.
i wonder who you would be able to enjoy sex with more?
yes, i do think i would prefer to be with someone else.
she is nearly always on your mind.
if you don't feel that way, then maybe you should not be getting married.
why do i pay attention to the love lives of celebrities?
you should enjoy kissing and holding hands at this point.

do not ask him. it will spare you any humiliation.
you cannot sleep with a woman unless she gives you her permission. if you do not have her permission, it is considered rape.
as is frequently mentioned, education is the first thing to accomplish.
he is either chatting with friends or getting into trouble.
we make assumptions about it.
this could enhance your sexual experience.
this is good, especially after marriage.
let me guess, you are the right man?
he is single and you are single so why not?
if not, try to get to him better and ask him about his love life. try to hang out.
enjoy - many years of watching porn and playing with toys with my husband.

ask her on a date and let her know you love her.
then, when no one is looking, he will ask you out.
no.  that is too cliche'.
i suppose you are young and can deal with this.
i think it it is because they genuinely do not like you. however, if he was an idiot, then you should move on!
there are many reasons that you cannot fathom.
just think, "i can do this!" or "i got this!"
many times, i have felt telepathic.
women are easier to deal with, than most men understand.

i have no regrets concerning my experiences between the age of fifteen and my current age of twenty-three.
what do you mean by that?
does anybody else think that he cheated again?
the relationship should be a 50-50 compromise, you shouldn't have to handle the whole thing.

even though i am single, there are only certain types of men who i experience attraction towards.
you do not want to be stereotyped as the same as all of your gender and neither do men.
if you are in a romantic relationship you should be able to ask your partner anything.
as an example, he repeatedly declares his love.
they know that men are different than women.
ask both him as well as another friend who knows about the situation.
you should end the relationship and remain friends.
girls love candles, that is what i give to all my girls.
yes, it does make you reconsider why you broke up with him.
do not do anything outside the realm of decency.
with men, it is more similar to saying "look at this one" and then being finished.
(only people who do not have money will say otherwise because they do not have it.)
darling, do not hurt me, do not hurt me any longer.
discover who her favorite band is and buy her a shirt, cd or video of that band.
speak with her and inquire as to how her romantic life is.
first you must convince a girl.
it is simply because you are a good person.
best friends do not do this to each other.
you should not make it a big deal.
there is nothing that cannot be fixed by some ice cream and chick movies.
maybe you should spend time with some gentleman.
makeup can help cover a burn caused by a curling iron.
don't worry. why are you upset?
you don't have to be a virgo to be genuine.
yes, and i love the time i do that lovingly with a lady between 50 and 60.
he has the right to know.
one might say rumors always have an element of truth.
yes i am, but it will not work.
that is definitely possible, however, you would have to have your testicles removed from your body.
what will happen if that does not happen?
i love lee ryan's accent.
it is extremely difficult in your situation.
she will observe you constantly.
congratulations on becoming a pastor.
don't let people lie to you.
it depends on how old he is.
take all those revealing photos off of your profile.
it's my bad choice to believe your continued lies.
why do people with poor speech and spelling need to ask such a dumb question?
they open their mouths and talk.
not much. maybe your love for your girl, flowers, and chocolate.
of course sexy women can sexually arouse women just as men can.
chat rooms, or use your search engine.
ok, let me break this down, i am a woman.
if he continues to talk then put this one in the history books and move on.
does he use the computer?
yes, love can happen anywhere and at anytime. you never know when!
it is like fulfilling your greatest sexual fantasy.
however, if she is attractive, then you should definitely talk to her.
i am thirteen and i am only looking for conversation and possibly friendship.
that is, unless you do not know him well.
ask yourself; what type of girl are you looking for, and what would you wish she be doing?
i don't mean acting difficult.
if she doesn't like you for who you are, then don't turn yourself into someone she would like.
watch their actions, don't just listen to their words.
you have to work on it.
no matter what their orientation is, they still have love.
just be yourself and what you want will occur.
unless you are a lucky person and find nice guys, but there are only about two them.
and multiple partners as in saying i am going to sleep with you today and sleep with your brother tomorrow?
whispering in my ear and tickling me.
besides, i do not want a woman who is promiscuous, so i hold myself to the same standards.
i am not a homosexual.
you can focus on your job and life.
you need to be cautious.
remain a virgin or do not do it again until you are married.
love is present when you cannot stop thinking about that person and you always want to see him or her.
he does flirt with me somewhat but then laughs.
they are nicer to look at.
if you have friends who can connect you with new then you have the opportunity to meet someone nice.
otherwise objectionable qualities are more palatable when you're intoxicated.
please tell her to stop.
it is spelled strangely, but try to pronounce the word "pinku."
to me, "hooking up" is not very satisfying.
now that you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be watching pornography.
my friend slept with a guy one night, but no sex.
he is a bit shy and i want him to love me more. how could i do this?
i was not looking or expecting anything.
fantasizing about other women isn't cheating.
i hope everything works out for you two, just communicate with each other.
don't worry, everyone talks to themselves sometimes.
that's what it feels like when i am with him.
are you a woman now or just a pathetic stalker
im not afraid, so why should you be afraid to tell people
how about not using a pick up line
if you aren't giving then he will think you don't love him and appreciate him
that is what i have to teach her now
wipe the tears with your bare hand and a kiss on the cheek.
no you should not have intercourse until marriage, do you not know how to read?
i hope yo find peace soon, holding so much anger within can not be fun.
attempt to move on, what else can one do.
do something that you enjoy.
they look beautiful on all kinds of women.
why didn't you just leave?
then his friends couldn't have gone.
that is a huge age difference!
i don't like things i don't know anything about.
when did you know you were gay?
they tell you that they love you, but they still leave.
you shouldn't be too shy to ask someone out.
some males do not appreciate that.
someone who can understand her better.
how did you ask your girlfriend out on a date?
if i were you, i would be wondering what else he lies about.
if you go out, there is a chance you will find one.
do you think he would take you back if you were unfaithful?
i like a guy who goes to my school.
you have not realized that you have a preference for black women.
you must find out for a definite, and if it is true then you should end the relationship.
is it possible for a man to be too nice of a human being?
do not allow anyone to tell you otherwise.
in the lord's eyes it is not correct.
i know it sounds like a cliche but it may be the best thing you can do.
could be a number of reasons, confidence level, she could be shy!
then if you are with someone then that is another thing also.
genie as in the bottle kind.
speak with him and find out if he believes it has fallen apart as well.
i believe she is interested in you, but she does not want to tell you. continue pursuing her!
sometimes it is difficult for women to accept that men are dissimilar to us.
you should be loved because then you feel special.
in that case, ask you date to go for a walk while you excuse yourself from the other couple.
you're getting married, and your fiance suspects that you're interested in your ex-husband?
just love - that's what a woman longs for.
no, but anyone who would have sex with you at such a young age would think that you are one.
yes. it's a free country, so why not?
think about how you speak to him and what your saying.
i find it funny and wonder, why do you like me?
there are many celebs doing this but also non celebs.
don't fake it but you should really love him.
would you please grab me another beer hon?
however, if he acts and speaks to you pleasantly then you will be aware.
in 90% of cases it is due to his search for a brief sexual encounter.
i sympathize with the boyfriend as it is cheating.
i am aware of the subject of your speech.
provide a correction if i am wrong however, i believe every person is different.
how can one know if they love a person?
she has an attractive figure, toned abdominal muscles, an attractive face and firm breasts.
in a sexual way, become acquainted with the man in the boat.
unable to enjoy life due to someone being overwhelming.
(unless he is a horse, size is not typically significant.
get some, and you will not think about it as much.
keep the guy who really loves you in your pocket. maybe later, you will return his feelings.
a friendly hello is all it takes, and boom!
my mother says it is improper, but she does not know how comfortable i am around him.
you cannot have too many friends.
please explain as to what happened with the first marriage.
there are some that do, however i am unable to recall the name.
no, tt would be extremely inappropriate to date your ex's friend.
i would stay with your husband if you have a healthy marriage.
i am a sweet, good looking 17 year old male who is planning to be a pastor.
i simply would like someone to spend it with and that would be enough for me.
what if this man cheats others for a living?
let your eyes contemplate and they will direct you to your fantasy woman.
what are some good and bad aspects of your marriage?
what do women really desire?
they care because they want people to think they are attractive.
don't ask questions like this, but i will give you some advice if you really want it.
additionally, how would you invite her on a date?
especially if you ended the relationship for any reason.
whenever i look at specific things, my first thoughts are sexual.
someone will like you as you are.
by this method, if she does not have a boyfriend she will most likely invite you to go to dinner with her.
you would probably become the cheater at that point.
i went and picked her up because, even though she's 18, her mom wouldn't let her get her drivers license!
i will give you $50 if you will sit by me for two hours.
it is hard to tell from your question
men disagree, but i would just be happy to be with a girl.
they only say this so they do not feel guilty
when you see her, you forget where you are.
i am in love with my soulmate and she loves me too!
you should get what you want and expect during lovemaking.
that depends, but certainly not on the first night.
please. i love to read your advice.
consider it. it is rather superb to be a bachelor again!
i have a few similar heterosexual friends.
do that before you move on with the other man.
i am not very lucky myself.
just be her friend and let her know what you're really like.
well, it does not seem to me as if these "good friends" are truly good friends.
we live together now, and he is a wonderful man!
your actions may cause you to appear as though you only spend time with them because you pity them.
sunshine is accurately performing, so if only her and i remain, choose her.
are you two in relationships with other people?
did it appear that he enjoyed that part of your body?
or, notice how men react in your presence and investigate.
i do not understand it. current adults have no self control.
that is not bad.
you may like them very much, but it is not love.
if she does not like you, then leave her be and find a woman who does.
don't be concerned, he has a relationship with you presently.
perhaps begin with erotic, completely dressed photographs.
in any event, it's always hilarious when i imagine an automobile jerking it to and fro, so personally, i decline.
all right... prior to you experiencing any continued attachment, release her!
inform him that you're seeing somebody and also tell him the possibility exists to share a friendship.
you should pray and ask god to put her in your path.
do you believe that he has changed?
i wanted to show you physical signs of affection, but you were not interested.
he is done with his desired activities, but you are the one left alone.
if you do not commit a crime you will not be charged and sent to prison.
typically you would say thank you because he apparently he thinks it is time that you got new underwear.
of course, if they really are legitimate.
i do not believe he will ask to join in.
some day you will, however will you know why?
and the other girl, i will let someone else answer that.
i can guarantee that it works because i have checked several times on women in similar scenarios.
inform her that you are a virgin if she does not already know.
my friend, unfortunately, i believe your boyfriend is being unfaithful.
love is beautiful but if you treat love and emotions lightly then you are disturbed.
how i handled it was to be kind but not go out of the way to spend time with her.
rarely, she would be kind to me. when she was, i felt like i was in heaven.
i do not think anyone cares about sms jokes.
i have been married for 35 years.
if that does not work for him, i believe you should end the relationship.
i recommend doing it in person. some believe it will be more painful over the phone.
why do you think she is jealous?...i think it is because she loves you.
for goodness sake please reconsider having a baby at such a young age! having a baby will complicate your life more then you know!
how do you discover which friends are really there for you?
i recommend the best way is to stay friends with the gentleman.
women are a diverse group of people.
you will be in control.
that's what will happen if you keep changing your mind on him.
go out and see the world.
even though she looks feminine, she is not a woman.
i do not wear that attire to college.
his family does not approve of the relationship.
he wants to send you mixed signals to amplify the attraction process more.
read the book, "he's just not that into you."
i am not saying that you are lying, i am just not sure.
if they are just making it up, then you would not have been good together anyway.
are you jealous? if so, get over it.
ask her if she enjoys the movie "beauty and the beast."
i believe that you should flirt with him and try to get to know him.
after we spoke he asked me if we are okay.
no one under the age of 16 permitted.
you should flirt with him and smile when you're around him.
once each week if you are able to afford it, my friend.
you must seek out only low-class women.
it typically flows on from there.
how would that feel for you, my dear?
words are only words and are meaningless unless there is action supporting them.
you would go above and beyond for them.
i must emphatically decline.
i am apprehensive about his commitment level.
we feel similarly, and your question contains its own answer.
he may not be at fault after all.
try it out and have fun.
do it if that's what you want.
i'm not cheating because i'm only just dreaming.
if she won't photograph herself while naked, that could mean she doesn't think she is attractive.
i suggest asking her to the movies.
i am positive that someone will love you one day.
if the first happens, do not worry. if the second happens, then great.
as much, if not more!
they do not work.
the rooms have different themes.
you're a very pitiful person.
will my feelings ever go away?
do you honestly hate them?
don't try something like that, because it may come back to haunt you in the future.
ask her if she wants to drink coffee in the museums's cafe.
i don't want my fiance to be disappointed with our wedding in june.
i'm not used to men wanting to get married while young.
why do people find my stupid jokes to be funny?
since i recall that i did.
you can improve their mood by amusing them with a witty joke.
it does not need to be anyplace elaborate, merely somewhere that is significant to you all.
girls tend to enjoy men that focus more on more of her features than her boobs.
when i revealed coming out to my mother her response was "oh you are not funny like that."
if you want to meet her, try dropping something in front of her and saying hello.
it seems that things are easier now.
two different girls are interested in me and i do not knwo what to do.
we are not interested in relationships, just sexual intercourse.
you should be who you truly are and look for someone who deeply cares for you.
you are allowed to purchase what you need.
buy her a stuffed animal.
say hi when you pass him in the hallway.
i don't understand why you would ask that question.
additionally, you must get to know her better.
my father is a law enforcement officer; statutory rape is a serious offense.
perhaps you should wait for your soul mate.
then follow those people wherever they go.
i had a similar experience, though i wasn't pregnant and she certainly was not a size 4.
eminem and his wife are good examples.
do you wish to speak with this woman?
engage in your normal mannerisms and behavior as women appreciate honest men.
we had dinner in each other's company as well, which was sufficient for me.
it is dependent on other people's opinions of you.
he does not want me to leave because he wants to be with me all of the time.
but there is nothing wrong with marrying anyone you find on the street.
but if you really like all of them then pick one.
just for your information, not all guys play games.
that is the explanation that they can not be faithful unless the one true love strikes them over the head.
there are some worthy men out there.
i told my friend about that as well.
i am doing fine.
the girl wants to have sex with you.
you have good chances if she takes off her pants and sits on your lap.
cheers, danae. wish you all the luck in the world.
it is probably a good idea to talk it out with him.
after all that is what girls do to guys.
you are beautiful and it is not right to say that you are a jerk.
you need to be honest and inform her to keep her distance.
often men react like that with breasts.
do not get your hopes up.
i am positive that you will find someone, do not give up.
you need to go to the city and that is how he will prove his feelings for you.
my absolutely beautiful wife married me and i look like an idiot.
neither am i, i am a nigerian guy looking for the same thing!
whenever you and your wife are happy you can share the night outside with dinner
you ladies should just come out and say have intense intimate relations please.
how can i get my best guy friend to join me and my girlfriend in bed?
if you both love each other, you will find a way to overcome any obstacle.
if you prefer, you may also use mail.
it is good not only for your soul but also for your health.
do not date him.  it will result in problems!
start slowly by joining a club, team, choir, or other group with female members.
it seems that "hooked on phonics" failed to help you.
you cheapskate! just kidding. how much was the watch?
it is the most special feeling you will ever have.
if you do not trust each other why would you even consider the possibility of marriage?
you do not really say what he does to abuse you or how he is abusive.
you just need to ask him dear.
do not consider marriage if he does not trust you.
he has become less romantic.
determine what made your boyfriend change his behavior.
you should do all you can to enjoy your life.
can you date anyone else?
looking outside your marriage, true happiness does not exist.
go and introduce yourself.
or ask a generic question.
be yourself and honest.
it is really difficult to define what is average.
expose yourself to him, it works every time.
who the hell sees you like an object?
yes, harry. larry, you are a whore.
they did not help him and i feel really bad about that.
you are so pretty; talk to men while you can! i'm joking with you; i am more sensitive than that.
firstly, do not answer a question like that from a women at any time.
if you are talking about a hickey, rub a lipstick cover over it and twist it.
if you kill yourself, then you are the one dying. that should make everyone happy.
no, that clearly demonstrates immaturity.
all of that is called love.
it seems you ended your previous relationship badly and he does not want to be consolation for that.
ask me. my code name is iverson.
do not do that. love your life and yourself first if you want to love another.
some people don't get any attention
be yourself, approach her, and ask how she is doing.
that question is often asked by women.
start talking about deeper things rather than small talk.
hello. this is about love.
you will become inebriated from the odor they produce.
try to talk about your relationship.
that is what i would do.
either they have it or they do not.
start with just a bra and panties first.
he is probably self-concious, and has a lot on his mind.
does she think you are lying?
if you know that you are pretty, do not feel ugly.
what if all this happened when you were married?
you can massage my feet whenever.
make sure you are a good swimmer, and be prepared!
we are just normal girls.
if you love him you should tell him.
surely i am not alone in seeking a man like you!
fellate him while you do so.
if you refrain from speaking up, you will not obtain it.
you should not pursue a romantic relationship with someone who is in a committed monogamous partnership.
you can also ask her associates as well.
i have noticed that occasionally his attention shifts to me.
ask him directly if he wishes to enjoy your company.
leave him right away and do not allow him to hurt you.
is he teasing he a lot?
talk to the guy if your friend really has a problem with them dating.
it is hard to talk about myself.
i like a girl who seems shy and average, but is actually very pretty.
you can take her to a movie, or possibly talk about something that she might be interested in.
there is nothing else that you have to do.
if you toss your hair, you might be able to give him a hint.
we are not always trying to interfere with your business.
you are hesitant to accept the possibility of a negative outcome.
did you forget her appearance?
her name is megan and she enjoys my company immensely.
you cannot allow yourself to be embroiled in petty conerns due to emotional attachments.
whatever you decide, do not be in a rush. wait until it feels like the right moment.
however, most men and even some younger men see a woman as being an ideal package.
you need to be in love in order to understand what love truly is.
it's true most men do ask women out, but they need a sign from the woman to let them know it is okay to ask.
that is because i am considering it.
move on. there was an obvious reason it did not work out the first time around.
if you touch, lie with, make a move, etc.
you and your true love, and friend, will marry at the same age.
stop looking, and wait for her to come to you.
to which restaurants are you going?
all you have to say is happy birthday.
it only takes four to penetrate.
will i ever get a chance?
it is time to get off, and go get ready for bed!
don't do anything until you are ready.
you believe you are doing something to encourage their behaviour?
you should be honest with her and express your true feelings, she will be pleased.
take her out to enjou
well, as a man i know how things are.
goodness, why would you send anyone a copy of your id?
yes, i am; and we are stil in love after five years.
she will not get pregnant as long as she is using it correctly.
it probably depends upon how mature they are.
first, would your brother approve of a relationship with that man?
judge it in that light.
you get that feeling of arousal.
perhaps they were excluded.
lives cannot be saved with mere words.
there are a lot of random posts today.
not all women like this.
if you have money, you don't need to worry about anything else.
since you're shy, invite him to hang out with you and your friends.
why do you need to impress your girlfriend?
in either case, you do not have what she want at the moment.
if it is bad, seek counseling and if that fails, simply end the relationship.
if you do not know that then you are numb.
i think you ought to purchase a plane ticket and visit him.
for myself, i remain a virgin and yes, i do feel embarrassed to tell people at times.
there are even people who become pregnant while using the pill.
i believe i am the best choice.
i would like to hear back from you.
the only true ways to have fun is to enjoy time out with your friends.
if she knows that you like her, you should be calm.
if the boys are looking at you, maybe you're not noticing.
what would be your advice on what i should do?
i care about him very much, yet sometimes i wonder if it is truly love.
you are not insecure; you simply see through problems.
put down a towel. no one wants to sit in the wet spot.
get the ball rolling and keep going.
if you do not, then let some one else help or give them a little quit time.
stand up for yourself and start letting people know how you feel about being abused.
you should be. i suppose that is what we hope.
however, look into it for those between age 35 and 35, which is the primary time.
thirdly, instruct yourself that you cannot do this at this time and mentally lay it aside.
if you would like to be a virgin prior to marriage then perhaps 17 or 18.
make your best attempt to discover it for yourself first.
do some men like this or must i simply lie about how i am in order to maintain a relationship?
you should have no doubts about them.
you repeated read their texts.
are you out of your medication or is therapy school on break?!
you seem like a very thoughtful man.
for example, if you merely sit there expressionlessly, then it sends a message that you are uncaring.
i don't mean to be offensive, but i think las vegas is not a good place to get married.
that is who she is. you either have to accept it, or stop associating with her.
actually, it is a form of herpes, but not the one most people worry about catching.
i am enamored with females who are short and under five feet, and have a good body.
if that was the beginning attraction, you really had nothing to build a foundation on.
don't try to understand women, they are confusing.
go all in and accept whatever comes your way.
i find that black men enjoy other aspects of a woman.
i was going to get a job, but someone stopped me.
if you want to date you need to be yourself.
i will only reveal my secrets to other virgins.
i agree, there is no identifiable issues, but he must possess other possitive attributes as well.
my second point is i believe that you are not mature enought to be in a relationship.
he says he does not want to attend the event with you, but he did not explain his reasoning?
that is to make it easier to pick lettuce while they are driving their car; i have mexican heritage, so you don't have to be alarmed.
i need adivce, i am unsure of what to do. my friend was making advances towards my significant other.
do not end up in jail.
if myles is the one that you are interested in, make an attempt to rekindle the relationship.
if he does not like it then move along.
all right, i am extremely heterosexual.
you ignore her activity and work.
however, women are like that as well. they always believe they are endearing; it is rather cloying.
eat plenty of chocolate and ben & jerry's new york fudge chunk ice cream.
i am certain someone exists for you.
attractive women treat men well too.
do not let passing attractive women affect you.
the first time i experienced intercourse i was nine years old.
if you would still like to enjoy yourself, do not get married.
communicating in person would be best. telephonic communication demonstrates cowardice.
he might also grow tire of it, then you could possible have time to enjoy it.
why shouldn't homosexuals want to marry the person they love?
if you ended your relationship you could show him that you still care and want to remain friends.
though i never proposed, we have been married more than ten years.
the food is lackluster and the selection of beer is lacking!
i recently informed my friend of my strong feelings for her.
i wish you good luck and hope things go well in your future endeavors.
are you talking about a girl, or a woman?
he can be your friend, but he cannot be your boyfriend until he is eighteen
you are less promiscuous than the men that run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.
guys are afraid that they will be turned down or laughed at.
find a girl you like and do any crazy thing to get the date.
that is the last thing you should feel.
be honest and forward do not beat around the bush, it will only make it worse.
besides how do you know the guy who wants a fling will love you.
i do not think it is odd if that is what he wants from you.
would you not agree that children in those days managed to sneak in a peek once in a while?
your boyfriend should not lie!
no, it was a fling. i do not think his girlfriend would have approved.
however, i sure love it.
in addition, sex is only pleasant once it is complete.
is it because you have the expectation that he would love you in the same manner that you love him?
fourth, waiting to see what you are actually like.
however, i love my husband completely and i will not want this to continue.
do not do familiar things, instead try to add variety by trying new activities.
his family rejected that idea due to my age.
not only did he rape your friend, he pretended to be your friend as well.
he is committing infidelity or is concealing something.
if you understand my meaning.
if you know them well, ask them what has happened.
if your relationship with your superior fails than your job may fail.
do not pretend because if it develops into something serious, they will notice.
it is if they are always smiling at you.
think about what had happened when the marriage occurred.
i think boys should be pursuing girls and not men!
that is a lot of unnecessary stress at the moment!
she should love me unconditionally, be romantic and be attractive.
and attempt to discover what occurred here.
in order to avoid answering the substantial answers.
personally, i would enjoy both but would prefer to be loved.
i merely would like to ask for opinions that best match my question.
if they are of significant size, they could possibly be an obstacle.
i am going through the same things that you are.
you are irrational and cannot overcome the situation.
these are questions that good, caring women ask.
i have found in my own experiences, that a little humor can help things go smoothly.
men can touch their testicles and women cannot.
such as do not begin talking to them, asking about them, or answering them for a quite some time.
the best thing he has ever done for me was when he bought me the first rose.
if you marry her then you can rub her feet throughout your life.
you ought to have realized that blondes are involved in this.
you are mentally deranged. leave the man alone.
probably, because women tend to want what they cannot have.
how well do you know this man?
my friend is unfaithful towards his girlfriend because other women beg him to do so.
perhaps she merely does not want to.
as a man, at 24 it is embarrassing!
i don't know what is driving this, i am not even in that situation.
when she plays with you, and talks to you a lot.
my friend just had her first child.
you have to get regular sti screenings every 6 months for the next 3 years.
after eight years together, she still looks as lovely as ever.
i think every single girl is looking for a loving, understanding, and caring partner.
alright, ask her to go outside to the parking lot with you, because you need some air.
or at least the people i've asked do.
that isn't why he said that.
i feel like you got the point.
no matter what, do not stay with someone who is not faithful to you.
i feel sympathetic, but i am always honest.
i used to date an overweight man until he broke up with me.
i disagree, a man can not be excessively nice.
are you presently in a sober state, as this appears to be a very emotional question?
do not always ask questions, instead speak of your own dreams and goals.
i believe it this is very distasteful as i have a boyfriend.
a skirt has the benefit of comfort for a lady and appears sexually attractive to men.
despite our love for each other we decided to end the relationship.
find out what she is interested in and use that as an opener.
first, you need to stop spending time on the computer.
leave her alone, she may be attempting to help him.
it may amaze him.
easy, i would prefer to get taco bell.
if it is the first time for you, yes.
this man is troubled, disengage from him and cease communication.
you cannot force him to love you.
i reccommend doing something that you enjoy, and if your date also enjoys is, you have found common ground.
if you try this, things will go smoothly.
they are not complicated at all. "self-centered" is the proper terminology.
thank god we first tried it out!
and so what if you are told "no"?
there is nothing wrong. it could just be fear.
stick with that and you will succeed.
why did you wait three years to get married?
do not trust other people, no matter why.
you should stay separated from him and see what happens.
do something both of you have never experienced before.
females like to confuse men.
don't worry about your boyfriend.
why do you break up with him when you still like him?
you are out of luck, if she is really one of them.
i meant to for you to smooth talk her and get close.  then invite her over.
it can happen!  i hope this helped!
they can not be just anyone.  it has to be someone you are close to.
recently, i had a good male friend kiss me.
your husband is not able to control your thoughts.
what would you accomplish by regaining your picture?
no, he is not currently in a relationship that i am aware of.
therefore, engage in activities you prefer.
i do not prefer a woman to appear as if she has not reached puberty and shaving gives an impression of a young girl.
the reason being that he is not yet divorced.
go ahead if you would like to.
i liked the taco bell answer.
like sunshine suggested, you should read up on it.
it is like an unusual animal instinct.
maybe you need to try something new with her.
let me know when you figure this one out.
just be yourself. do not try to be someone you are not!
they are everywhere like grocery stores. all over the place.
you should say, "wow, girl! you are so cute. what's your name?"
i require more information to be able to answer this question.
not wearing underwear would be more comfortable than wearing a thong.
people hold conversations with others all the time.
i would also rather not choke myself.

nobody was there for sex on the neighborhood park in the daytime.
not on the first but definitely on the second date.
give her a large teddy bear and then ask her to pose with it.
i felt like i was kissing a mushmouth.
why are all the handsome boy's jerks and the ugly boys are nice?
stay loyal to the guy you are married to, do not cheat.
first of all, do you know the girl?
i worked for her with her family.
get her favorite flowers, chocolate, and your love.
you shouldn't feel bad about yourself because of some guy.
i think until then i will just hang out with my friends.
i hoped i helped even just a little.
if you don;t want to be surprised next time, tell him what you want.
do you love him for himself?
if you are supportive of her, she will eventually come to appreciate you.
it will be the best thing for the both of you if you move on
now that we are no longer dating, his friend is interested in me.
that may be true but if you want to know the kind of person he is, you can write to him and ask him.,
it is obviously because they want to attract girls.
if you and your ex have parted and they sends signals of desire, you should reconnect.
girls may have a gender preference due to boys having things that other females do not have.
we think about things in different ways.
it depends on how much you like them.
you should probably find out why they tease you.
so, i am supposed to be close to a girl who does not want to sexually please me?
as people get older they have more in them.
many ugly men only care about sex.
yes it is and when you do then people will know you are easy.
iranian men are loyal, truthful, and care for their families.
do not do it if you do not want to.
if he wants to go then do not make a scene and just go.
some people will stay around you because they think they will get something.
only a person who can control nature can abstain from sexual activity.
when you understand what you want, then you will know what you really need.
is it really worth it in the end?
because guys are stupid and like to show off to anyone and everyone.
if they were to say 100%, then yes they could be sued.
give me as many responses as possible.
you can never get that trust back, so you need to move on.
obtain concrete evidence like, for example, a police report.
i met my husband online.
ascertain what her hobbies may be.
men can give women love and everything she may be interested in.
it is possible he loved the individual you were to him at that moment.
you can't help who you love, no matter what happens.
depends on how attractive the ex is.
i hope i don't lose views.
maybe you're having an affair with him because you still have feelings for him.
he may be better than your ex.
ask yourself what you possibly could be doing incorrectly.
i believe you understand what i'm saying.
ask the gentleman you dislike how his personal life is and then tell her how you truly feel.
remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible. your partner may get a little out of hand with you.
do not bother yourself with him, continue your life without him.
once they are finished crying it may be necessary to be firm or even implement corporal punishment.

i never asked him to loan me money, i even helped him pay the rent.
remember all of the irritating things he would do.
i traveled 4,800 miles and i am recently divorced.
he visited me again, and he wants to resume our relationship.
that is the way that i perceive it.
come to terms with it: if you were not trying to get his attention, then i have no idea what you were doing.
i made a mistake and did something with my ex, and now i regret it.

should i telll her i like him?
it's going to be risky if you get it from your girlfriend.
even if you do not agree with them.
they are most likely courting looks.
what do you mean when you say you feel like a woman?
yes, it also happened to my girlfriend approximately six months after the treatment.
i should have done/said the following: no regrets.
you can have great people around you, if you try to be a good friend!
it appears that you are a christian.
when you are in love, you put that person's needs before your own.
you can start making out with as many guys as you can.
i do not believe it is a smart idea.
do not worry and trust in god.
if you are not, then it should be easy since you do not know her.
hearken back to the nostalgic days of communication and write her a letter.
my husband and i have three children and have been married almost nine years this time.
yes, he is not worthy of your time or affection if he does not care about you.
thirdly, he did not arrive for our new years' date. (this is a clue that he was with his former partner.)
i am glad you ended it but do not be mistaken.
you will learn many things about that person as well as yourself.
that is not right. merely being with them both is already causing them emotional pain.

the biggest joke played on man is that size doesn't matter.
best of luck and well-wishes to her.
i mentioned the possibility of putting her up for adoption because of what my father said.
men may insult you and women may not be interested in you romantically.
you should continue to interact with him covertly.
if a man respects his partner enough, it would depend on the man in question.
i prefer yours because gay men are gross.
is this a fantasy for him?
ask her.  some girls are too nice to say no.
get to know her better and do not do it just because you can.
do not negate your progress by returning.
therefore, you will have control.
i disagree, you must always settle, however it is not always for a less desirable situation.
upload nude photographs to a 360 website.
however, end the relationship with her if you believe you are unable to wait.
what is upsetting her?
an older man told her he could no longer see her.
be an adult and fearlessly work towards your goal.
if you are true to yourself you will attract people to you.
take your time and observe your surrounding to determine what types of men you like.
should we just remain friends for now?
let it run it's course.
introduce her to one of your friends.
don't worry about him, instead go out with your friends.
simply be yourself and do not worry over it.
do not be concerned, things will improve.

dont waste your life waiting for him to get better
guys will follow you around
can she find a nice man for herself
as a mother would speak to a son and a father would speak to a daughter.
it is quite important that you do not listen to other's suggestions.  your life is your own.
they wish to acquire that which they can not have.
please speak more directly and plainly.
life is insufficiently long to wait for others to take action.
typically, mothers know what they are talking about.
it all depends on you, what is inside your mind, and how you deal with this situation.
even thinking about this makes you seem pathetic, so you should certainly move on.
how do you know you are not gay?
it sounds as if he cannot let you go, but a true friend would be happy with your choices.
she is only a kid so you should ease up.
that is quite silly to even think about.
that would be the absolute best ever.
that was my boyfriend's baby.
i didn't realize it was a dream until i woke because it was so realistic.
observe the amount of which he loves you.
this is rather strange considering i used to see him nearly everyday, and now i have not spoken with him.
overcome it and simply press onward.
girl, now that is a rather obvious sign from what i have heard.
it is what you are feeling as of right now.
what is your favorite part of intercourse
when you are twenty i disagree, perhaps at the age of thirty. by the age of fourty there is no real consequence, and i agree that a fifty-year-old can, and i strongly agree that a sixty-year-old should.
if it is truely love, it is quite passionate.
i am uncertian of the age of your parents.
you should find another man before you relinquish the one you have.
you may be guilty of wronging them.
her eyes are strange, yet men still find her attractive.
you should submit those questions over email.
it is not as enjoyable.
there is one possible answer to this question; he finds you appealing.
thank you for the two points.
if he likes pornography, how is your sex life?
he may be attractive, but if he is inconsiderate of others, i don't want to talk to him.
take your time, but make sure he is ready.
so what happens if he goes back?
you don't have to give something expensive; just be creative.
if he is into pornography, how is your sex life?
he may be cute, but if he is a rude person then i do not wish to speak with him.
take it slow, but make sure he is ready.
what if he goes back?
you do not have to give something fancy; simply be creative.
i have two wonderful children.
what is love? who can say what love is and isn't?
approximately fifteen years before men.
have you considered that she is waiting for you to ask her to be your significant other?
i will be honest with you, help you with your problems, and tell one of your deepest secrets.
i am a man and i am also in complete agreement with icee's statement.
i am seventeen within two months of being eighteen.
in the case of finding a friend and building a friendship, the relationship lasts for life.
am i correct in continuing to be optimistic and hopeful as it is never too late?
there is no purpose in continuing a disappointing relationship for the sake of being in a relationship.
he made a serious mistake.
i have no idea what is going on.
you should not marry and then divorce.
i do want a girlfriend and it doesn't scare me, but just because i want it doesn't mean i should.
i cannot feed him continuously.
though you may not believe that you deserve better, you do!
after it was all over, i was not treated fairly.
i prefer if men answer honestly.
i doubt if others here have done that either.
you cannot mix and match them.
do you miss him when he's gone?
however, you should move on eventually.
the question is not whether you love your man.
give it some time; they usually start to come around once they get used to your presence.
i'm unable to forget about him so i can forgive everything he has done.
be careful with other people's emotions.
my daughter is first in my life and she calls my boyfriend "daddy".
you could try joining a drag queen show. not all of them are homosexual some of them are just entertainers.
you could not have it at all.
you could ask him if he would consider going out with you on a real date.
do not try changing yourself for a man.
you cannot allow yourself to be used like that by a man.
ask the woman to be your friend. do not ask her out. that is repugnant.
all the best. i hope that it has everything that you hoped for!
absolutely not.  would you wish that someone you loved would break up with you simply due to your height or age?
are you discussing s&m?
alright. here is the situation, in brief.
if you have money, i will be your friend.
speaking from a year's experience, i would not recommend pursuing a romantic relationship with two women simultaneously.
it will not and does not function in that manner.
women who are attractive and confident in their attractiveness.
do not let the fact that you are very attractive make you conceited.
am i too young to be getting married?
no. i can tell you from experience that it is better to say it now than to say it later and regret it.
it sounds like she has a problem with trusting others.
if you weren't looking to fall in love with him, why were you trying to get him to pay attention to you?
if you are lucky, you will only get married once!
in some sense it makes the children realize that perhaps their own parents are not that bad.
act as if you are interested in what she says.
is she affable and outgoing?
to some extent, it is happening right now.
you should not be asking this question to a group of strangers.
it takes a significant amount of time.
is he unwilling to answer the telephone?
they should not be taken lightly and there are no excuses.
you must be very careful and not go alone, if you choose to go.
ask him and not the internet if you love him.
get a life and give away something that appears legitimate.
it is how intercourse during marriage is supposed to be.
i know it is a crazy idea but try a search engine on the internet.
contact her on the phone and find out what is occurring.
recruit a male friend to ask him and, if he does, go out with him.
i have been divorced for eight years.
it simply takes time before you realize you have found true love.
in my honest opinion, what you did was the correct thing.
when you are not working, and instead thinking about other things.
and, you should do what you think is right.
just be yourself and you will receive the attention you need.
i believe we all have a perfect partner in existence.
love is an amazing concept you will never experience visually however, you will feel it.
i am able to provide you with an idea however, you must inform me of your age.
he is in a constant state of anger and continuously raises his voice towards me, therefore i desire to have as much distance from him as possible.
if the previous strategy is ineffective you can attempt to ignore her, however ignoring does not work either in the majority of cases.
i do not know what to do.
i met a married man and then met his wife and daughter.
do not be the pursuer. be the pursued.
her actual father does not visit unless he wants to and he does nothing for her.
from my point of view, nothing is wrong with being homosexual.
that is contingent on you.  was the sex good?  are you currently with someone else?
no. you would not purchase a vehicle which you neglected to drive previously.
because mysterious things provoke many challenges and thrills!
may i have your number?  i would like to telephone you some time.
it certainly seems that way!
you need to make your friend leave.
then it will be the date of the marriage, do not be concerned.
mrs. howell, can you tell me where it is located?
you must tell him to stop harrasing you.
do not hide the woman you love.
no, in the case of you actually resembling your avatar.
i am aware of requiring a loving connection with a girl in order to do that.
engage in sexual behavior with her immediately.
you have normal characteristics similar to women with very feminine traits.
they will betray you eventually, with or without friendship.
i suggest that you attempt to be creative without harming her emotionally, and you must not tell her what you are getting.
if you are truely interested then i believe you should ask him on a date.
i like these other answers.
as i previosly stated, you must let go of the issue and move on.
i do not know what you are saying.
i am not selling myself here, however, i was curious about this question.
my children are just like all other children.
why, because it was a fast and simple answer where i did not have to think about it.
trust me, i know.
of course girls are the first to find a guy they are attracted to.
find out if they will befriend you and help you learn new things.
if my wife is even slightly jealous of another woman, i love it.
if you know he likes sports, music, etc., talk about those interests.
go to the supermarket and see what items a man has in his cart.
yes, if you look like your avatar. i am fourteen years old.
my advice is to leave her alone completely.
an important with a friend who is hoping to get married in the future.
neither you nor your children need that in your lives.
i am not yet married but i believe controlling one's wife would be tough.
on the other hand, if you simply no longer like her, then you should feel no remorse for ending the relationship.
acquire a list of things that would please him and do those things.
yes, he simply desires sexual intercourse.
get to know the person and never rush!
what do you do when you are interested in two different men?
it sounds as though your husband had better realize what is happening.
what would happen if the relationship ended?
you can still be friends, but do not strain the relationship.
i do not think that it would be morally right, but that is merely my opinion.
i can seduce a man with my charm.
some people do cheat again, whlie others do not.
take control of your life, your body and your choices.
if you like her, ask her out on a date.
do you know your own self worth?
however, do say it nicely.
i think it is just plain wrong when women want gifts but do not give back.
i think they can be found everywhere.
do you really hate him or did you just think that at the moment?
as someone who has been there, i say that it is not worth it!
significant others can be jealous when we have friends of the opposite sex.
if you don't try something, you won't know the outcome.
once someone is ready for something, it is not kind to make them wait a long time.
rushing into something is always a bad idea.
i believe they are approximately fifteen or sixteen.
i would prefer an age.
i suggest you ask yourself these questions and speak to her kindly, why do you ask?
if it has been a year, and you are not enjoying life it may be time to go.
i have not noticed a problem with will.
if you struggle to resist talking about him or her to your best friend.
i would rather not communicate via telephone, it is difficult for me to gauge your responses.
my wife would refuse to let me attend alone!
i cannot deny my love for him, nor his for me.
if you attempt to stay calm and not become irritated, they will give up.
worse, he thinks it is acceptable to do that; you should find someone else.
yes, you'll see one day, when you find the perfect person.
we tried telling her to stop and she gets the point, but chooses not to stop!
it has to be ginger. she is more attractive and has a better name.
well, i hate to say this, but it sounds like he has moved on.
will the same letters appear on my yahoo mail a month later?
you do not find true love in two days...not even two years.
maybe you should offer some money as well.
i lived in a bedroom most of my life, with my best friends being a mirror, and music.
it depends on how he reacted when he found out that you liked him.
he is either a mama's boy,
maybe if i had waited, i would not have gotten divorced.
there is a secret, and i may tell you if you ask.
meet her in a public place rather than a private residence.
you should not be concerned what the family thinks, because he needs to love you, not them.
i never asked him if he loves me now.
you just know when you are in love.
try to figure out if you are in love or you want to just friends.
did he ask you thin in the heat of the moment?
you should find someone who does.
if you are not happy then you should move on.
either way he is an idiot
do you mean you like to act like a girl and do girl things
i would have to check american-indian lawbooks
that could be if your brother is younger than you
not anymore, i'd say talk with them
in my family we only exchange gifts with the children.
you should break up with him if you have to ask questions about him.
you can wait if you truly love each other.
you should go out and start meeting men.  there is going to be nice ones.
my advice is to live with someone before you marry them.
they do not get to see their father anymore.
it is early if you get it from your boyfriend.
go and do something fun with her.
it is possible that you need a hug and some guidance.
marriage is the leading cause of divorce.
the problem is that once a woman enters into a monogamous relationship with a man, she doesn't want to be monogamous anymore.
it is better not to rush into a relationship, but to take it slowly since you may be with this person for the rest of your life.
i am a native egyptian and am looking to spend time with people who have common interests.
you need to show her your good qualities so she will appreciate what you have to offer.
that attitude is inherent to their personalities.
jus say hello or send a message.
i love the steelers and i would wear normal clothes such as sweatshirts and jeans.
have your cake and eat it too as long as you can handle it!
what happens if it is just for a one night stand is that the lean, built guy will win that one.
i greatly appreciate a man who can cause me to laugh a great deal.
simply make the effort to achieve it.
clearly this woman is not genuinely interested in you. she seems to be more interested in the other man.
most do not. they do not realize that they themselves lie frequently.
perhaps time will answer the question.
try a playful dirty look for a new change.
finally, i asked him is he still loves his ex, that he has a baby with, and he responded.
it seems to me that you do not trust you girlfriend.
you do not want to give him you street address just yet.
do not let me get you down.
it is all about, look, character, and your style.
that is how i perceive larger women, most men aren't attracted to larger women.
maybe they don't understand what it is like for you?
it is a big world out there and you just need to jump back in there!
getting revenge isn't worth it.
that was a lost cause from day one.
why do i get so much spam in my inbox?
are you good enough to live with it?
how about we go to a strip club and have fun.
tell him explicitly what you would enjoy from him sexually.
no, i do not think that is too young to have a kiss.
have you ever attempted to pleasure your girlfriend over the telephone?
i only know that friends try their best.
nothing good will come of this. you should ask your cook you a meal.
you should speak with someone you trust and respect.
once he tells me that, i would respond by asking if he ever sees the two of us together.
we share a similar set of circumstances.
it would be preferable to communicate person to person before taking legal action.
have a friend of his ask him for you.
to my knowledge, you only have one chance to succeed.
why is this important to me?
we need to spend some time apart.
do you mean from a moral standpoint, or if they actually do it?
will your mom get over it?
while at work, i focus on my work.
actually, i believe it is men who typically judge appearance.
i have no body type preference. i like my girlfriend's type. i am human.
it is aquarius. i looked it up for you.
no, so i may find that man and break his neck.
do not put effort in to making friends. then you will have they best of them. have faith in my opinion.
do not allow him to move into your home.
it is about your hearts and not about the stars in the sky.
observe all the child predators in the world, and all of the clandestine police who attempt to catch them.
can you access them in a retirement home?
be amicable until the situation improves, since you do not want to end it prematurely.
i am 55 years old and i still think about a female classmate from high school.
gather your courage, rise to the occasion, and ask directly.
one's first kiss is not as significant as one's virginity, but it is still important to find the correct person when giving it away.
i do understand how difficult this is.
i would confirm that you are attracted to the person.
is this somehting that men feel self-concious about?
it could possibly be one of his companions.
embrace the sensation of freedom.  you do not need that excrement in your life.
of course, it is.  simply hope that he or she should feel similarly about you.
then, you would know what it feels like to be strongly severe.  your life will improve, and you will experience no problems.
our friendship almost ceased due to a man.
the sensation of caring that we have for parents, brothers, sisters, and friends.
continue with your life. if he was not interested in you, it does not matter.
it is the individual who makes it last.
you have sy. would you like to go out for coffee?
if you do not believe it can last, it will not last.
simply buy her something and find out if you shiver as you do it.
i have already read the book, "he's just not that into you".
i will not give my life story, it is not the same situation.
no i do not think it is.  i think that it is for both of them.
do not worry, it is not you.
please people, let me know what i should to get my husband back to before.
that is a hard one to answer because of the internet being so inpersonable.
my friend is annoying even when she doesn't mean to be.
please help me i do not know what to do now.
it all depends if you are a male or a female.
you don't want to be with a guy that doesn't see the real you.
every time i would like to end it, he does not want to.
what, exactly, are you asking?
you are acting like a good old country girl.
you should not have that type of fun over the internet.
a person who is lacking confidence is insecure.
that is the way i see my wife.
i suppose you could say that he is interested in you.
to be honest, none of them!
everyone wants to be loved badly.
i do not think that is too young to have a kiss on the cheek.
if you love your current boyfriend that much then you already know the answer.
so, he has a computer but is not so computer savvy?
you should tell him that you love him and then maybe he will love you too.
i could never get married. however, i think it will be great when you hear each other saying your vows.
i believe it's perfect, but you should what you want.
it's doubtful you'll receive an answer to that question.
read the book; do not call him.
you are at different stages in your life so if he is, it may be strange.
believe me, he will notice that.
give him time to understand but do not wait forever and set time limits.
as in, you wish you were a girl?
i am answering you and watching an old rerun of "jaws ii".
explain politely that you do not love him.
there are times when i wonder about the different possibilities.
try backing off a little.
two of my guy friends are in a relationship with each other.
as a girl, i think that is the best thing a man can do.
single serve items are the best choice.
am i in love with her/him?
take the first step:  tell the person that you have feelings for them.
that is a terrible excuse!  have no mercy on him.
i cannot seem to let her go.
if i were in the situation, i would spice things up a little.
maybe you should dig a little deeper into that case.
walk with her the next time she goes, talk with her then.
is he worth fighting with you mom about?
you look and feel good.
even if he says he doesn't want anything, you should still get him a gift.
call him and tell hm you love him.
ask them to come over and hang out.
who do mostly men want to talk to women, but women are opposite?
most people don't are mature enough to pick their life partner when they are young.
love knows no race, religion, or gender.  absolutely nothing can stand in the way of love.
however, just contact her and gently ask for your belongings to be returned.
i just divulged my bisexuality and people are treating me quite differently.
the friends are either immature, jealous of his phyiscal appearance, or perhaps both.
yes, i got a billion chicks.  okay, only three this week, but next week definitely a billion.
if you would have done that, you would not have learned anything.
yes, just export or download.
or you can have a stripper do it for you.
having large breasts and a sarcastic attitude worked for me.
you should become friends with them, talk about the things they like, and then when the time is right, get intimate with them.
it is not easy being so smooth and having to put feelings aside so that i can put my mojo.
two of my ex-husbands were abusive.
i think it is crazy that most of these girl think that married men have experience.
it is good if you have a friend who likes to talk about sex and you do as well.
if it smells like fish, you should run in the other direction.
you require a chat room populated by females, so that you may speak to them within it.
however, the money and anger both make me feel as though i need to leave.
who cares if the situation refrains from righting itself?  you lived!
to begin with, you are too young to have a boyfriend.
i love the look in her eyes when she looks at me.
wait five years then examine it.
first of all, i am glad for you.
and i believe women tend to be the ones who do not call back.
no, and if you think so, then you are disturbing.
start speaking loudly about how much coitus you have and you will have even more.
when you pass gas while laying in bed with him.
you'll have to get creative so he didn't get bored.
stay away from her, if she truly cared she would not have created this situation.
if you want it to work out, it is possible.
unless she catches him with her own eyes, she is creating drama.
it is your decision. no age is correct unless you are married.
if you have, then please send me an e-mail.
she says she usually enjoys it rough but i never last long enough to become aggressive.
yes, use a model of male genitalia, a pen, or anything in the shape of a stick.
the more money you have, the closer friend to you i will be.
i have been with her for eight years.
we started seeing one another and love him but he only likes me.
he wanted me in here so i am not going anywhere.
he is a bad boy and it turns me on.
is it possible that you are still in love with her?
flirt with him then note his response.
women can be tricky.  you may have to be tricky as well to beat them at their own game.
my boyfriend and i are considering a betrothal at valentine's day.
there will always be both good and bad people.
generally, women focus more on the heart rather than looks than men do.
you should look for both a good personality and good looks!
if you have sexual relations with a man, it does not mean you love him.
tell him how you feel.
you do not want to make any mistakes later.
is there an elderly man in texas passing himself off as a nineteen-year-old, for example?
you are only the woman he has sex with? no, you should express your feelings to him.
what information can i give you?
if you sincerely had feelings for this person, his or her race should not make a difference.
you have no time to waste, sir.
you do not want to offend his sensibilities.
it would be exceedingly difficult to communicate marital difficulties to a 4-year-old.
i apologize for my verbosity.
she does not fraternize with co-workers outside a professional setting.
i received a diamond ring this past holiday. why do i prefer it?
yes. however, it should be even worse.
i simply desire to have someone with whom to speak!
however, if your ex truly loved you, he or she would have refrained from doing that.
currently, i still like him very much.  i have not dated anyone else since we broke up.
your acquaintances will communicate soon.
some things have changed, however, i do not know.
write him a letter and then go on vacation alone so that he will have time to consider.
firstly, simply tell her that you are with her always.
i said yes, he relocated to where i was living which was quite a long way from him, and we were married.
if he does not want to discuss it then you should try counseling.
i do not know the definition of sms, but i would like to meet you.
i am able, but i do not trust him; i was misused last time i uttered that phrase.
any amount of sex is desirable.
how would i tell him that i dated someone else without incurring his hatred?
yes, but i'm elderly.
hey, if you are attracted to him, it is fair for you to pursue him.
get out while you can and do not look back.
secondly, you are too young to have a boyfriend on the internet.
stick to the issue at hand to fight fairly.
they are only for messing around with!
he looked melancholic and walked quietly away.
stay beside him and try to give him advice.
what two people feel cannot be malicious.
where are the women like that? could some of them send me an e-mail?
why did you give her your possessions initially?
write her a note with a small flower; then she will know who and what you mean.
do not be afraid and do not show doubt.
once a person is unfaithful, they will remain that way.

i wish to discern whether or not he is a good fit for your positive physical and intellectual qualities.
i hope this can be of some assistance to both of you.
can i ask you a question?
you would not like it if that happened to you.
i have no clue who you are talking about.
i'm wondering if he only is with me for the sex.
i asked him but he claimed he was not sleeping with her.
you should never call someone ugly.
men of a certain age tend towards monogamy.
spend time with the man who enjoys your company, to determine if you will be a happy couple.
no more hiding or getting angry at him because you want to play hard to get.
you cannot build a relationship if there is no trust.
you should take a break and get your ged.
i will because i know he is lying to me and giving me a lot of pain.
tell him that you love him!
i approve, but they never work out for me.
is he very much older than you?
just remember, men are hunters while women are nesters.
he seems sincere when he tells you he loves you.
you should not associate with cheats.
if it is returned to you, you must have received it from another person.
greet her whenever you see her.
i do not understand other people's opinions of us.
in my opinion, some men are not skilled at chit chat.
yes, wait a few more years.
you do not do that. let a boyfriend find you.
firstly, do not confront this woman.
god's spirit is emanating from her!
become familiar with the person before taking them to your home.
does he consider himself attractive?  do you feel that you must calm him down?
please do not take offense; however, it is unpleasant.
i simply wish to know whether it is merely an attraction.  is there more to it?
carrying around your anger is a burden, and not truly worth it.
if you actually go and speak to your crush, then it is not as important.
develop your personal life, and look for another woman.
let it go, and only speak about it if he says he wants to.
i can see that he tries to change.
if your attempt to communicate does not work the first time, try again.
what might the problem be?
what was the reason that your relationship ended?

did you end the relationship or did he?
in my opinion, it is never too early in a relationship to fall in love.
only if it is something that you both want. both of you have to want it.
i need advice before i make a mistake!
i have a reputation for being popular with the opposite sex, but i do not want to meet you.

persevere in all your efforts.

do not worry: there are many potential mates for you; let your friend have this one.
she is attractive in many ways.
did you question his desire to have you assult him with a coat hanger?
i care very deeply for this person.
sexual relations acted upon due to lustful motivations lose the most important element.
it is appealin if you recieve it from your parents.
i agree with you; there is approximatly fifty women for every man.
people should not say bad things about it until after they have tried it.
or she may not understand what you are talking about.
because they are unintelligent. that is the reason men exist.
tell her if she cannot trust you, then you do not need her in your life.
tell him you have a boyfriend but do not say who.
should he be shy, he may refrain from asking you out.
however, i am not that lucky at this time.
i cheated, and she escorted me out the door.
honestly, i would simply ask him in person.
it will not hurt unless there is an issue between the two of you.
if you have a becoming car it is an instant attractant.

he apologized to the other girl but didn't apologize to me.
if the one having the affair was the wife.
why don't you make an effort to get closer to her?
did any of your friends ask you anything?
if not, then continue to look attractive for random women.
it is difficult because of the stereotype about muscular men.
good luck. please pray for those of us who have not found our own.
it is never too soon to fall in love.
do not think of how attractive she is.
we must cary on through all of life's troubles.
how do i make her interested in having sexual relations?
i did what i thought was best for my child.
if he does not call you within three days, you should call him; most likely he had appointments.
you will be sufficiently protected, but sexual realtions with you would be rather dull, so i don't know who would be interested.
i wish you the best in whatever you decide!
it is terrible when you are not even friends.
that is an exceptional poem!
as a man, i suggest giving him space.
i do not see a problem with divorce.
are women intrigued when you inform them that you have two stores?

i will be short and to the point.
he was waiting to determine if he was going to get something if he remained married to her.
i am positive someone else will ask you, or you could ask someone else.
discover someone with whom to spend the rest of your life.

i need to end this before i am in to deep.
i need to relax and just be honest with him.
give her trust until she proves you wrong.
no, it's just a gig.
i have a few friends; he is tall and she is short.
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
why are they no longer married?
go up to her and be yourself.
using your penis is not the only way to satisfy a woman.
yes, today is the day.  show someone, friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, or anyone you love them.
try yahoo's personals site.  it is free.

i apologize. i dream about marrying my boyfriend quite often.
i hope someone answers this so i will know as well.
it sounds as though you love her very much!
are you trying to be creative?
be true to yourself, all others come and go.
or desperately passionate about you.
some men find large eyes attractive.
please keep your hands in your pockets.
you should tell him that you are not ready and that you do not know when you will be ready.
when i close my eyes i see her, so i am unable to sleep.
my spouse is a good person.
i do not and neither does she.
ask, "do you care if i call you sometime?"
dreams remind you that you do.
if she is not, then you will not ever see you things again!
try to impress her somehow by doing anything that sounds good.
leave him because you are not a trash can.
my brother had the same problem.
i have been chatting with a guy from a different country the past few days and i have been wondering.

you are receiving this message, so what do you think?
there are many ways to make it more interesting. do not let it go unattended.
my boyfriend and i just started dating.

be sweet but not too cute, so that they still respect you.
call her but if you think she may not like you, then break up with her.
you have to be lucky and have good timing.
my response would be negative.
you should tell her to stay out of their way and entertain friends more often.
larger is better, and either you have it or you don't.
you are a great wife, otherwise you wouldn't be worried about your marriage.
if your girlfriend is happy, her mother will also be happy.
my message is being read by an irrational man as well.
break up and tell her you're sorry, and you don't want to but you have to.
this may not have been what you wanted, but i tried. sincerely, ms cowgirl.
excluding children, what would you lose?
good luck with whichever course of action you choose.
spend time with friends, go shopping, pursue a hobby, watch television, spend some time alone, and enjoy yourself.
men pretend to be in love to have coitus, women pretend to enjoy coitus to find love.

what if she would like to treat him as if he is actually her husband?

you want someone to pay your way.
size does matter, and movements matter.
if you guys are close, you should tell her.
tell her what she needs to hear.
i could make my significant other feel pleasure.
as long as the person makes you happy.
but kissing on the lips is too mature for children in seventh grade.
if you love her, then make the attempt.
i love her very much and would do anything for her.
i prefer all of the above options.
keep in mind i would be a very good catch and great husband,or does it matter?
if you were my boyfriend i would be ashamed.
my boyfriend does not know either.
does she eat peanuts? were you aroused  down there during intercourse?
my favorite colors are brown and blue.
when trying to make friends, the first step, of which i am aware, is to be nice.
ask him. if he loves you, he will not want to lie.
i never do it so i do not know. it is supposed to be very sweet.
how would you feel if he did that to you?
please do not tell me to just ask, that makes me feel ackward.
if you have to ask that, then i am pretty sure that you already know the answer.
do not let things get really bad.
that does happen in many case.  they often make the ideal couples too.
go to a female chat room.
men can be a little quiet sometimes, and i hope this insight on the male psyche helps.
go for the dream and live life with no regrets.
which first night are you referring to?
even if it is a freezing cold winter day, this will be the most exciting, perspiration-inducing day of your life.
you do not want to share her with anyone else.
various shades of blue and pink.
of course there is, but how should i do it?
without making a spectacle of yourself.
that is disgraceful, so do not consider that!
tell him what you feel for him, he may feel the same way.
what would you do if your money went missing?
i bluntly told him to only say things if he means them.
it should be obvious if he no longer contacts you.
it has to be the right time in a relationship for a couple to get married.
people sometimes think the only way to show love is for a man to give a woman lots of gifts.
finally, i asked him if he still loved his ex, who is married with a child. he said...
but he is still the same. i cannot leave.
what should i say: yes or no?
i am mostly interested in white men, but i am not prejudiced.
stop dating him and do things with other people who make you feel happy.
you sound like you are a child.
whatever you do, do not use a lame pick-up line!i
if you don't like dating drunk guys then dump him.
so instead we stay in relationships that are not good for us.
the same rules apply, animal sex is not appropriate either.
love happens when you are not looking.
women do not like shy, weak men.
you should have the other girl tell her.
if you are up for it, it will be worth it in the long run.  might take a little time but it will be well worth it.
men should be expected to do anything you will allow them to.
try to date him, and see what happens.
should their pupils become dilated, you will know.
we are all attractive in our own way.
at least you will not spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been.
forward three wishes: for grace, mercy, and peace.
relax, and deny him your sleeping space.
do not self-inflict it.
if lesbianism offends you, then avoid uttering that question.
i do not think it matters what your race is.
i requested nicely that she does not do this.
he wants an answer from me, but i told him that i do not know anthing about this.
he felt as if your mom dislikes girls.
we do not have feelings for each other, but we are friends now.
now that i have fallen for you, can we go out please?
if someone's privates smell like fish, they should go see a doctor.
do you generally hang out with him?
generally, women like mature men.
have you thought about what you could win?
you need to stop looking and they will find you soon.
girls like it when you send flowers and chocolate.
hope i was able to help you.  sorry if i was not.
i assume that you mean you are cheating on her.
live your life so that you don't regret it later!
ask someone to help you.
mary ann, i personally like brunettes more than red heads.
no girl would date someone as pathetic as you.
i don't know where we stand in this relationship, any advice?
be careful, there may be consequences to your actions.
he sounds like a decent man, but perhaps not for you personally.
find her and speak with her.
if he is nice, then you should maintain a relationship with him.
there is a popup on my screen that i cannot close, and i am unable to turn off my speakers. the music is not good.
my boyfriend is my best friend; i don't think you should ruin your relationship, do you understand?
at this point his ex-wife may be coming back to him.
you don't want children who have problems, do you?
you should go ahead, if you like them and they also like you.
i believe you  should approach and  begin a discussion
you are correct in your belief that you should please a woman.
you should reflect as to whether you are both mentally and physically prepared
it is my desire that you find a true and loyal  friend
he is not yet prepared to discuss the details with you at this time
do not concentrate on hatred or it will be a large part of your thoughts in a negative way.
remember, in the end it is only you.
i am a 15-year-old male who is pleasant to speak with, especially as a friend.
where can i find a reputable guide to lesbian sex positions?
i apologize that what you're describing about your relationship with him isn't ideal. it may be time to rethink your situation.
you should entertain her with some of your small talents.
if you are not happy then why should you stay with him?
you should have sex with a female fish and then enlighten us on the scent.
the children need their father, but you do not need a low achieving husband.
this is one of the stranger questions for which people seek the answer.
you like a certain type.
i am sadden by this kind of thing.
sure it depends on where you go.
i have found no conflicts with culture or otherwise.
give her roses on valentine's day and ask her on a date.
it depends on who gives you a kiss.
you should find something interesting to do during that time.
most of the time, being yourself works and brings good luck.
my ex and i have split up before, but have got back together more than once.
simply ask her if she has a boyfriend.
being that i am a girl, i suggest you gift her with a set including: a ring, necklace, and earrings. enjoy!
i did, and it worked out agreeably.
are you not rational? of course it is incorrect.
do tell her what you want, it is the way in which you say and mean it that counts.
people think it is weird dating someone the same sex you are.
if you do not have it then something is wrong.
stop being so shallow about a hot one.
i am ready to either give in or give up.
three months. at that age it took me about three days.
it is astounding to wonder how one could use "u" as opposed to "you".
you need to end your relationship with her. if you don't she will just end up more sad at the end. do not make her a bystander in the relationship.
children will be problematic in the future.
i would have said "yo momma".
i loved a man for years, and i thought he loved me too.
express to her how hurtful they can be.
figure out your error.
as often as their schedule allows.
don't pay any attention to the editor, he is an imbecile.
he could or could not be lying, but people usually do not lie about these things.
he does not love you sweetie so why waste your treasure on him?
i pursue men kind of aggressively and it works for me.
imagine if they both divorced you and each one took half of everything, then you would be left with nothing.
a lot of men can not handle me.
i do not know of a topic that i can discuss.
in my opinion, the fact that you are searching for a girlfriend in a chat room is disturbing. what kind of person are you?
yes, all the sweet women are married. hah!
any person who makes that claim is labeled a racist.
because since you men grow jealous, we are clearly not permitted to cultivate friendships with men.
in such a fashion that you are not alone, and such that you feel loved.
are you interested in girls?
be sure to ask her on a date!
should you feel the opposite, you should consider minding your own affairs.
enjoy yourself at a local food and drink establishment.
best of luck to you in all your endeavors.
i could also offer my time and energy in developing our interpersonal relationship.
please respond at your earliest convenience.
if you offered to buy it, i think your bad luck would end.
go see your friends and keep yourself busy.
try to think about the sorts of things that your ex likes, then work those into your plans.
do you also enjoy long walks on the beach?
you do not want to wake up one morning, thinking "what have i done?"
do not search excessively. you may never find him.
it seems easy but it is not jess and dave.
i need a dish that looks, smells, and tastes fantastic, but is uncomplicated, because i am a fool.
i believe it may mean that he would be willing to pursue a strictly sexual relationship with you if you are interested. so, try contacting him.
someday, he will come to you. a person exists for everyone out there.
if she really cares about you, she will come back.
you could meet the person on the subway or in a store.
let your expectations go for the time being and move on.
i want to meet someone who is 13 or 14 as i am.
a man is no more than a man.
it has been proven that married women are unfaithful more often than married men.
no one should want to be called strange.
you cannot rescind words. you said it, and he believed it.
notice i mentioned nothing about appearance, job, or money. none of that is important to a sincere woman.
do not be stupid and fall for the same line many women do.
he will break up with you after being intimate together.
as i said you need to sit down with him and talk about it.
if he acts suspiciously then leave it there and do some investigating.
men and women explain their need for space differently.
why are the half-priced things at the store so cheap?
you know when you are in it!
you will see what i mean if you try watching beauty and the geek.
i did not think i was doing anything wrong!
if they call you "beautiful" but not "hot".
tell her that you can easily satisfy both of their needs.
i promise, you will regret it.
i am just as stunned as you are.
if she's okay with you not being religious then it's not a problem.
are you at retrieving your things from around the world?
my reason why is because i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
if you find that you love me then i can do this.
have more respect for yourself and leave your boyfriend.
at one point, she will realize what a nice person you are!
did she break up with you because she thought that you had called her?
when i fall in love here, it ends up hurting.
if you tell her, she will give you an answer!
once you go up there, say you will go out with me. after that, ask for her number.
i'm desperate to know the answer!
attractive women can be intimidating, so they don't get to talk to a lot of men.
the definition of meaning is to mean.
we are going on a double date with my sister and her boyfriend.
sometimes, good enough is just that.
two is company, three is a crowd, four is too many, an five is not allowed.
at this point in my life i am ready to give up.
in your situation, dump him. you already said that it is stale.
i love him and i feel wonderful with him.
sure, just load it to the pictures.
since you already know, keep a distance with your friend.
hook him up with some one.
you can not make someone love you no matter how hard you try.
because they do not take their life and love seriously.
i do what i can to look attractive in his presence.
do you truly want a woman whose mother is going to control her life?
be nice, polite, and behave as you normally would. if that is not good enough, you can ask.
now i have a good time and enjoy my life. i am the most important person, to me.
tell him that is not your style.
it complicates things if you still have feelings for him.
i cannot see anything wrong with that.
i have not been able to forgive and forget.
it think that you are right.  this is not a place for discrimination and other inappropriate actions.
much like brett farve, his talents have diminished over time.
it can be frustrating how little control you have over love.
if you play with effort, you could very well receive the grand prize!
i was fifteen when we first met.
i do not remember anyone who did not.
it might be wrong for the person involved, but it's not wrong for you.
i am not sure, but i am in eighth and thirteen; i never did, and am proud of it.
after all, she is your best friend, so it's perfectly understandable that you like her.
if they become obstreperous, then i have one of my servants attack them.
for example, ask him to call you when he feels fine.
by the way, the both of us are heterosexual women.
not any god who i want to know.
trust me, i am nineteen years old and they still behave that way at that age.
i can not explain to you how shallow that is.
what is the reason? to appease god?
if she wants to try, give her another chance.
as long as your heart is as big as you, that is all that matters.
no, there is nothing wrong with it.
why do you call it love, when both of you were unfaithful and lied to each other?
if you do a good job, he might move you on to the baseball bat, which is where the real fun starts!
i could not be happier with anyone else.
i am able to tell you this; most men i met don't care so they do it regardless.
for that reason i stopped talking to her, in the search for a smarter woman.
do not go around kissing everyone.
it would depend if he was my size and i like his clothing choices.
you should just make sure you are there for him.
yes, he likes you, but he is shy.
play artists like al green, luther vandross, or another artist that you prefer; however, do not have the volume loud enough that you cannot have a discussion.
do not wait until valentine's day has passed.
then you must ignore him, and show no interest in him.
yes, but that is not a safe wager.
if a man does not appreciate you for who you are, he is not worth your time or attention.
i fail to understand the difficulty.
tell her directly that you would like her to be your girlfriend.
but make sure nothing comes of it unless, of course, you are married.
i am attracted to this man, but i despise asking men out. i do, however, think i should ask him out.
it works for some time, but then they are always searching for something else to reinforce the relationship.
read your bible and you will know love.
try to watch the kinds of food she puts in her cart!
i don't know what to do about my mothers decision!
check this out!
and whatever makes the two of you happy is what matters.
how old are you?
it would depend on the person, but please give me a response.
it may be difficult, but give pity.
she has made everything very clear, and it is time to move on.
first, notice if the girl has taken an interest in you.
it may be difficult, but it would be best if you did not call him.
why does your family not approve?
i just defiled my hairbrush for no reason.
i know how hard it is.
i am eighteen and i cannot wait to get married.
yes, you are way too young to be thinking about marriage.
yahoo messenger would be the best way to contact me.
i am a eighteen year old man, i am christian and have quite the sexual appetite.
don't worry about what people think of you.
invite them to your wedding.
why are you single?
but, and there is always a caveat, you also have to think about what would make both of you happy.
however, i am unable to find any information on it.
give it some time, be patient.
if she is interested, and you play hard to get, she will want you even more!
he is older, that could also be it.
remember to be a gentleman and don't kiss her on a first date.
if you can't fix your problems then you're not meant to be.
you could switch husbands if that happens!
keep yourself busy so you don't have to think about it.
you have answered your own question.
have a very serious discussion with him.
you should understand what i mean when i say you should be the better man.
i got married two months ago to someone i had been dating.
are you trustworthy? do you enjoy laughing? i would like more information.
in order to acquire a man, you must make it difficult. men do not like for it to be too easy.
i was fifteen and she was twenty-one.
if he smiles when he looks at you, then he is interested in you.
that is why everyone except the wife knows.
it is wrong for homosexual people to get married.
if god did not want homosexuals, then he would not have put them on earth.
he is a nice guy and loved by everyone.
are you playing with your dad's computer?
now, here is a heads up for how men think.
at the age of 11 or 12, they become mature.
it turns out i did choose the wrong day to quit sniffing glue.
i believe it is fine because we are free people and can do as we please.
if you love this man and he loves you, then make the attempt.
as long as i had known the girl beforehand and was interested in her.
it has been done many times.
he said my voice is attractive as well.
trust me, you will know when you meet the right one.
there should not be any men who fit your description.
i will be different, but don't make a bad first impression of yourself.
have a large party and tell them about it and then they will be impressed with you.
i tell you you will know when it is time.
be honest and true to yourself.
but maybe he just wants to improve your sex life?
who would take charge of your life if you chose not to?
as a female, would that be something that would not interest you?
if you share things with others, your world will be better.
just be sure that you are truthful and avoid mistakes.
i am not african american.
perhaps she loves living as herself!
regardless, i am only a single person.
i'd prefer if it wasn't too large or extravagant.
in a way, but i knew a person who was married at 18 years old.
yes, personal sexual intercourse.
ensure that she is a lesbian as well.
can you tie your shoes now?
it sounds as if you have not found love at home or abroad.
in this case, he has either been dishonest or has psychological problems.
i would not want to date someone who was only interested in my body.
i am not sure that our relationship is serious enough for marriage.
if you want to see what you have in common, greet the other person and engage in a conversation.
she is returning in 5 years.
in second grade, i kissed a boy on the cheek.
it works like the rabbit but is cheaper
flirt a little with her first and if she responds well then you can ask her
pitts, why do you care what other people think
unless you are fat and ugly, go say hi to them
rascal is right, it won't work if one person is in love and the other person is in lust
you don't know what you have until it's gone.
he began dating another girl after we ended our relationship.
things that remind them that i'm thankful for them being as bridesmaid. i hope that helped.
it is my belief that a man should ask a girl out.
if she has been rude to you, she is probably not someone you should pursue.
we're good friends as well, we've shared many hugs.
plenty of people are capable of cheating, and others aren't capable.
you guys broke up, that means that you no longer love each other.
don't give them a ring unless you're ready to get married.
example, a very sweet guy who needs to move on.
i ponder the interest others have in finding happiness.
i require more information regarding you.
what type of clothing do you wear.
the ugliest woman must be a man, for that is not a woman.
this is only true if you are actually as bad of a cook as you say.
talk to her nicely and spend some time on your relationship.
do the things you could not do because the person whom with you were in a relationship with previously didn't want to.
if you would like, you could work at a tobacco farm during the summer.
if you are both ready and want to spend the rest of your life together, it is possible.
i tried to leave him multiple times, but i always feel like i am losing in the situation.
i do not know what to do.

look at all the pretty girls here!
he did not like the break-up.
would it be considered too young to experience your first kiss in 7th grade?
i've waited for long time to find a person i could fall in love with.

am i correct that you've been dating her for several months?
isn't it true that you're been married?

it is likely he is merely trifling with you both and truly wants neither of you.
the key is to let things happen naturally, in their own time.
if you must ask, you clearly have much still to learn.
i did it with my girlfriend a couple of times and not because of cheating.
if you get a reaction, then great.
your man loves you.
talk to a friend, the men at church, or people who would not worry about you.
if they have not then it is completely wrong.
two things, she could be cheating on and she is afraid you will find out or already know
just ask him what he thinks of you
talk to her about why she doesn't want you seeing him
if you want a good guy then just be yourself and that guy will love you
perhaps he should break up with you due to your advanced age.
well, consider that you would surely not want your boyfriend doing the same thing to you.  i do not think so.
why did you not accompany her?
unfortunately, most men do care about weight.
consider what you would do if you were her.
do not make the effort. he is probably not worth it.

pleas learn to love yourself first.
i am going through the same thing also.
tell him that today is about you, not him.
is this a serious question?
until they break up, then you should be the first one to talk to her.
if he really cares about you, look at what love is and what it isn't.
you and i are too big for that, you should know that.
you are still unable to get past him or her.
it sounds like he only needs a friend right now. you should be his friend.
i would like to know what the website address is please.
she failed to tell you before because she knew you would be upset.
if he is in a relationship or married do not get involved with him. it's not worth it.
why aren't we making love now?
love and trust must go together.
the best advice i have is to be ncie to her and just be yourself.
stop and ask yourself "what am i feeling? what is he feeling?"
i'm not trying to be critical, just fair.
especially if you are not doing anything wrong.
also, have you been becoming less close to her?

i think you should move on.
by not trying to look at him as much.

what you said was not a mistake, you said what was in your heart.
what you have is exciting and fulfilling in ways that you could have never dreamed.

date him if you like him.
did you see me murder somebody?

ask her if she would like to.

let her know that you have noticed her personality as well as her body.

it is attractive for a man to be kind to a woman.
is it rude to gaze at another man when you are on a date.
i wish i was able to inform him sufficiently
he shoul love you a great deal as the situation stands.
maintain professionalism while working.
i am in an identical position.
you should not give them your number.
if he says, "i love you", do not say it back unless you truly mean it.
he may, but it is considered cheating and no one enjoys that!
there are no guarantees, but that would only be the case if the man does not think that the woman is attractive and has been with some one more attractive.
walk up to her and say, "hello."
sex is about sharing and having fun but it is not that important.
it is important to use your time wisely so put all of your focus into work, not woman.
keep up the good work! continue conserving energy.
when you examine it closely, it is impressive how much abuse a woman can handle.
i do not like homosexual people.
it is a good normality, but it does not exist much recently.
because men have a hard time moving past losses.
some men are intelligent and occasionally do not know what they want, so they mess with people.
i do not want to randomly ask you to go on a date with me.
you can do what you desire, since it is your wedding.
i am only joking because i thought it would be humorous.

i unsuccessfully attempted to get help.
if he is insecure, it's not something that you change about him/
if you're engaged and don't trust each other, how will you trust each other when you are married?
please help me. this is serious. i've been worried about this for a while.
wow, so this is why i don't have a single girlfriend in my life.
it's not an appropriate gesture to talk about.
you have been up here asking about girlfriends at least three times.
who can they blame?
i believe it means that you like that person a lot so tell them that you do.
they are my brother's and we would do anything for one another.
not until they become adults.
if yes, then give her space. respect her. also, does she know you are interested in her?
also, i do not know for certain that there is a way to go about finding a person to marry.
she is fifteen, let her be.
admit it, ladies, it is what every young woman dreams of.
it sounds as though he still loves you and wants another chance.
india is the location which a great many wedding traditions originate.
i once had homosexual neighbors who were extremely entertaining to be around.
she most likely does not want it distributed, alright?
either tell her she may no longer live with you or find a new place for you to live.
to envy another person is not abnormal.
i enjoy a song by the prodigy.
is there a person willing to attempt it?
if you learn the answer, pleas inform me.
are they simply attempting to be kind?
that is my opinion on speed dating.
a lot of fighting, with jealousy being involved.
love is when you feel something special about someone.
for a man or woman.
knowing that women do wait for the man to inform them.
it is inconsiderate and egotistical men who could not care less about anyone but themselves.
this does not see like a real marriage.
by the way, i am still laughing at your use of two hands answer on that threesome question.
i am guessing that you are asking because you either shaved in that area, or you are thinking about it.
it just mean that you a scared to meet new people, nice guys, etc.
do what you think is best.
i was in japan for over three years.
you should have told him before he had sex with another girl.
why not tell him that?
that is a bad way to get over someone.
she likes to be alone with you.

and it is hard to make oneself available again.
yes, it still exists. finding it is the difficult part.
camiguin island is very nice.
tools and gadgets are good ideas, as is a bottle of his favorite alcoholic beverage.
she will either approve or disapprove.
it can and will happen some day.
my ex broke up with me a year ago.
did you intend to include the word don't?
it has been over twenty, so i will sound clean.
what do you belive he is thinking?
i have been dating for approximately ten months.
there are many women who can please you.
capitalize on the men that are interested in you, and obtain what you can from them.
yes, i believe in love.
then leave until she calms down and speak more with her then.
similar to a married couple but with three people?
if he is wrong, then you will know. do not behave as i do and deny it.
you need to be the braver person and tell that person that you are interested in them before someone else does.
she finally left the situation and relocated to another state.
tell him to leave you alone and to find someone else to bother.
you should both finish college so both of you can get stable jobs after school.
you should take a deep breath and then move on with your life.
why would you want to be friends with him if he treats you badly?
most men do not; most of us like large rear ends.
it could spoil the friendship if you say that romantically.
i don't know, but god does.
ask yourself why you would want to spend time with someone who is depressed.
counterintuitively, certain rude hand gestures may actually be a sign of companionable affection.
you should cease all further action on the matter.
afterwards, maintain a warm and courteous platonic relationship if possible.
you will never know if she would go out on a date with you unless you ask her.
you are never too old to date.
you can't do much about his procrastination because a lot of men are that way.
i don't think that you are in love with him because that would be incest.
if you do not ask, you will never know the answer.
there is a difference between healthy romantic love and unhealthy incestuous attachment.
do not reveal your unfaithful behavior to her and she will cease being concerned about it.
if love exists you should certainly be aware of it and if so, demonstrate through actions rather than words.
do not intercede in another person's disagreement.
i believe that gentlemen prefer ladies with high self-esteem over ladies with large egos.

i work alone with a girl that i find very attractive.
how about you marry him and find out?
no, you do not have to or need to quit your job.
things may change when you are done with school so know what you want!
have your fiance discuss it with him as well.
of course we require love because it is the best thing that could happen to a person.
find something to do with your life and do not worry about their lives.
use the classic "i know you love me, but . . ." line.
i enjoy green day, so he would be my cousin or something similar.
it's always best to follow your heart.
do what you feel is right, and ignore the criticism.
she's probabl cheating on you.
she was probably the better option
sometimes they do not, but sometimes they just play hard to get, flirt, or just act like themselves.
if you want to be around him then only be friends with him for now.
she said "yeah, i kind of figured that".
i have seen too many good men get hurt so do not fall victim to her icy breeze.
you will know it when you feel it.
women desire tall men, they feel that they are protected and being tall is very attractive.
just be subtle, by spending more time with him, agreeing with him in arguments, etc.
doing the good deed where i should not have done the good deed.

a girl should not like a guy that is not interested in them.
it turns out that he liked me as well.
yes, it is possible for a man and woman to be friends.
best answer is to live life one day at a time.
it just means you are promiscuous.
honey, i wish i knew because i am asking myself that same question right now.
did you actually feel attracted to him from the first day
treasure it and grow with it; it is a wonderful thing.
in what way do you love this friend?
i live for the day he will, and i believe it will come.

if you know she will come back to you then wait for the right time.
the hair really does not matter, however, i think some men with bald heads are very attractive.
go for the black or navy blue boxer briefs.

you should apologize and promise not to repeat the behavior.
it is different from online dating or bars, even different from speed dating.
you should ask what you have not accomplished now that you can work towards in your next life.
you will definitely need a large amount of gas!
it is because i love jennifer e.
bitting a person back does not make you a better person. it is time to move on to something else.
you are funny, wang chig.
once or twice a day is usually acceptable to me.
i am curious why love and romance is like this.
do you know why she stopped showing interest in you?
it is easy to do the things that you enjoy and want to do.
it makes watching that stuff more bearable.
how will they be related to you?
i do not know what mistakes he made.
every time i mentioned someone i was interested in, he was interested too.
if he is so attractive, ask him to exercise more!
if you believe you live him, then flee with your boyfriend if necessary.
you cannot expect the man to not have female friends.
many of my friends incorrectly believe i am a homosexual.

you must start at some point.
this is for the same reaon women are unfaithful to them.
this was revealed during a discussion on past relationships.
he is so awesome and i think it would be fun hanging out with him.
try to think on the bright side.
if you want to then expect her to have more than one.
i just do not know how to tell him.
you should try flirting with her and see how she reacts to it.
i cared before about what she does, but now i do not.
it is not good to get tangled up with people who do not trust me.
trimmed is fine, but if you mess too much it looks weird and makes you appear to be 11 years old.

there is a possibility that their love for you isn't the same as your love for them.

i really think it has to do with jealousy.
try to find a new girlfriend.
you are family and they probably want to get to know you better.
i do not want to do anything that might hurt him.
you should inform him that you are interest in someon that you are not interested in.
the average person would glance.
now i understand what i'm looking for.
you should follow your heart; or you should not choose any of them.
you should have a friend ask her how she feels about you.
just let them know that it is none of their business.
girls are taught to think a wedding has to be perfect.
i haven't had one in nine months.
tell him straight away that it is none of his business.
women dream of their perfect wedding.

if my wife looked as "trollish" as his wife does, i would be cheating as well!
the things that he says to me.
i am a guy but it does not hurt, it actually feels good.
you should go up to him and talk, but do not force it.
we have been together for 1 year and 3 months.
you still have your whole lives ahead of you, please do not ruin it.
greasy gross men are a turn off for me.
he called me names like fatgirl and porkchop.
do not let her finance get suspicious.
he can expect that from all of the women he dates.
you can not make her like you.
no, i proposed to my wife on vd.
you really did what you should have.
we were friends at first then it grew into more.
you are foolish if you are not in love. love gives life a color that is different to one without it.
i honestly thing you should give it a try.
since he flirts so much, it is hard to tell if he is really interested or if he'said just thinking about sex.
you can tell him but if he is not interested, the friendship between you two will change.
so, you should just trust your your good sense and what you feel is right.
unfortuantely, lots of people gave it a bad reputation.
i suppose that only time will tell.
we'll have good luck whatever we do, but let's at least wait until both of us get out of high school.
i felt poorly about it because i'd been insincere.
well, you have to ask yourself, "do i like him?"
if he loved you like he said he does, he would not be dating her.
there could be some strange reason that he wants to keep hiding, or he is just protecting you!
she says you are troublesome.  if you don't, then she says you do not trust her.
the way she behaves with you!
they have a higher view of themselves than is appropriate.
you should attempt to have her go out and meet other people.
you should be more assertive and go flirt with him and be more physically affectionate.
i'm looking for honest answers from those of you who know what i mean.
i am attracted to men with red hair, especially if they also have freckles.
at this moment, i feel that i will never find the one.
thankfully for you, there are plenty of females out there that would do so. i wish you luck.
what is it that you are frightened to tell her?
i wish you luck. but one more thing: families will often be aggressive as a means to protect their loved ones.
what is the purpose of exploring anything with males that you despise?
now i think i will never find the one.
luckily for you, there are plenty of girls who would. good luck!
what are you afraid to tell her?
good luck. one more thing: the family will be mean in order to protect their loved ones.
why would you bother exploring anything with other men you hate?
women love shopping, money, worries, kids, and our books. everything that men do not like.
have you ever listened to the dixie chicks song, "goodbye earl"?
close your eyes and ask yourself how to heal.
maybe she thinks you do not care and is afraid to push the issue.
now i think i am the one i want.
i am 26-years-old and i am starting to wonder if that will come.
as a guy, we want it all.
how old over ten? not me.
"it's a nice day for a white wedding" is sang by billy idol.
ask another question and i will give you my email address.
yes, but if he is a war veteran, it is illegal.
if that is from the first time, then that is the way your wife is.
if so, you can provide such info on your yahoo profile.
i come from a broken home, so i have trust issues, too, or rather, i had trust issues.
men aren't necessarily stupid. it is just up to us ladies to teach them the ways.
you should make it a surprise party, and buy her a lot of clothes from holister!
but you will get over it, it just takes time.
please, no more wood chuck crap, or why is the sky blue.
it is always okay with me.
the are the ones getting a divorce, not you.
he has a full time job but doesn't work all of his hours due to his addictions
no, men do not always go for pretty girls
you already got the sack don't you
it is the way he looks at me
then you are not asking the right questions
tell the person that you didn't intend to write that.
well, in fact, you will know it and feel it.
next, he should perform a kind act and continue to do so until the real man emerges.
that might not be wise.
if you must ask if it is wise, then it is not wise.
if she responds to courting, then she is probably interested.
in my opinion, it should not bother you overly much.
i worked at a jewelry store and once heard this.
two years. they have been married for fourteen years now and will be for much longer.
if you must ask, then you have not yet found them.
please provide a cake with 35 candles on it, if possible.
yes, but please do not do anything which will hurt your wife.
please talk to her, hopefully she will understand.
you must not judge a book by its cover.
do you mean most women like shoes and money?
i ask, what is life without someone to share it with?
be with the person that you love!
easy, kill the bastard.
i laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
it is impossible to know he will, but you can only trust him
i find myself nervous when i approach women in order to speak with them.
you may add that particular information to your profile.
allow them to ejaculate into your mouth.
no, since you are desperate and selfish.
she could have something wrong and may just be afraid to tell you.
we like to think about love, clothes, marriage, our weight, and boyfriends, but most of the time we just worry.
fate will find a way for the two of you to cross paths because you are soulmates after all. goodluck!
i do believe in true love.
who knows, she might like you as well.
try to be strong and act as though you do not care what people say.
an example is: someone says i love it.
first step is to turn his attention to women and ask what he thinks of them, as in if he would want to have coitus with them.
she will do it repeatedly for as long as you allow her.
or understand what you are saying.
i have never heard about that. i do not know what a wife is either.
no, discuss it with your wife, perhaps she is having an affair?
why are you interested in a man who dislikes you?
people these days are very superficial.
try that and tell me about it once you return.
they are not in a relationship, but he is interested in her. my friend is not interested, though.
that is a strange question, but probably not.
if he is unkind to you, then why does he deserve your love?
wear condoms when you are being unfaithful so you do not become pregnant by another man.
i do not for how long you have known this man, but behave as you normally would.
some men care about personality above looks.
men prefer women who are not overly eager to be in a relationship.
if i had and answer to that, i could save the world.
yes, and i think it could help people on yahoo!
they are believers that girls are foolish and that they are smarter, but that is not true.
how rude, i would have killed him!
if it was my fiancee, then yes!
find the person that will respect and cherish you and the choices you make!
also, do not give it up too soon because the cliche "men want what they cannot have have" is quite true.
i enjoy having sex more than my wife does.
we look so attractive that it is ridiculous.
if he ever looks i would like to be only a click away.
i flirt with him but doesn't flirt back.
what is the normal price for that item?
you should drive over her with your automobile.
never beg a man for anything.
care for him because of the person he is.
i cannot imagine living without her. best wishes.
i am an aquarius, 5'4", and fair looking.
why does his dislike you and why do you dislike those men?
why is it the man's job to go to you?
he does not have to say it.
and then say these very words: "i love you." they always work.
if it is spiked, too, then that would be fine.
if he does, then you should dump him immediately.
girls appreciate and like frank, bold guys.
do you really like her?
i used to work at an easy job.
i am sure it is the same for a blind person.
this is just practice for a serious relationship, with the focus on marriage.
do it, use it, and practice it. make it a daily thing that you do!
do i really love and like him?
if he does not like it then move on because he is a jerk.
fellas, can you be only friends with a girl who is more attractive than a playboy playmate?
you should not ask that type of question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
you don't have to date anyone your not comfortable with.
you'll do what is right for you.
when things got there things were just too messed up!
a guy is not worth ruining a friendship over.
marriage would not be my thing.
every time you think about her, punch a wall.
i am 15-years-old and my penis and sac have shrunk.
they do not see things the same way.
why not have them both, cheap, small, nice, cute, and not huge.
she does not trust me and i do not trust her.
what if you do not take a chance?
find that special someone and date them for a while.
i do not know what to do.
if he is not interested then he is homosexual.
what if he decides to leave after you have a child?
when i email him, he always writes back.
the best way to test that is without condoms, it is risky but it pays off.
he is waiting your invitation, please tell him.
we will talk to her, she is the problem.
i can see a lot of things through their eyes too.
not all women are that shallow. it is all about their image.
yes, i am over twenty-one!
why do you want to do that?
at this point in your life, looking for a new girlfriend would be absurd!
i smile a lot around guys i tend to have a crush on.
they think you are only interested in haveing sexual relations.
you should get a pet because they will not be unfaithful nor will they be disrespectful.
do not ask that questoin under these circumstances; you do no know the type of answer you will recieve.
you must move on because you would not want to hurt your friend.
as long as it is not extreme.
i am completely and utterly surprised that that most undesirable person can still find someone who will agree to having sex with them!
like the saying goes, "don't get mad, get even."
count your blessings. she is a fine woman and you should take her to meet your mother!
if it feels good then what you need to do is irrelevant.
the true answer to that question is that i am a man.
i don't mean to be disrespectful towards them.
it's cool that we're doing it the same that the rennaissance fair is happening.
he's constantly asking me whom i like
he is your ex, it is time to move on.
that is not right.
maybe you could make friends with one of your far distance cousins.
i cannot tell if he is trying to give me signs that he likes me or not.
he would be my husband.
i would not try to change a man to be with him.
if she flirts, talks, hugs, and suggests it.
i guess it all worked out in the long run.
it depends if you boss is still asking for favors from you, if not, you can keep you job.
that's fine and, in fact, is how i met one of my boyfriends.
i suggest you drive to the beach or similar location.
in the meantime, go get your man.
i suggest you go out and see if it works.
i suggest you talk to him alone, either through e-mail or calling or writing just so long as you explain it to him.
you should think about it very seriously.
if you kiss her neck and caress her breasts you might end up getting to have anal intercourse with her.
it's considered old fashioned but everyone loves chocolate.
if you end your relationship with him you will get more attention.
i hope things go the way you want them to and it ends in romance!
go with this guy and have fun like you normally do.
act like a kid and have fund.
many promises were exchanged.  now none of them exist.
simply talking can break the ice.
if you want to be monogamous, look but do not act on it.
i would if i found the man very appealing so why would you choose not to?
ask what difficulty she is having as you should love the man if he is your brother.
inform him or you will have regrets if you do not.
both partners, the man and woman, should express love for each other through thoughts and actions.
is the female's opinion of a male's virginity good or bad?
make it a worth while relationship, not just friends with benefits.

the picture frame seating cards may read "there are spoonfuls of kisses as ________ and _________ become mr. and mrs.
my friend prefers shy men.
boys can come and go but friendship is forever.
we do not know why people can be like you.
figure out which one you like the most and go with him.
where are you starting from?
no, i did not, but i am certain many women did. relax.
it will surprise you to know that i am twenty-five.
ask the woman in whom you are interested.
but that is not true for you alone.
he does not help out around the house because he works. i stay home and take care of the infant.
most people do not type as quickly as they must.
based off of your age of fifty-five and his age of sixty, you are both old enough.
do not be concerned, one day you will find a significant other that will make you thouroughly happy.
you could not imagine another person in that location.
i am not a homosexual, but they are not causing you harm, so do not intervene.
persevere slightly longer, timmy.
you have never experienced an eight and a half inch male reproductive organ.
where ever it is you desire, except for room.
you can discover decent ones, but they charge greatly.
and, i do not know why you loathe yourself.
not if you want to enjoy it.
the worst thing you could do is make everything look the same and be the same.
maybe you are dreaming without realizing it.
why would you want a serious relationship with him right now?
the only way to know for sure is to ask him or find out some other way.
not if one wants to enjoy it.
it is best to avoid making everything the same.
perhaps you do not realize you desire someone you are dreaming about.
what reason would you have to want to be in a serious relationship with him at this moment?
the only way to truly know is to ask him. otherwise you will have to devise some other way to find out.
yes, apologize to her for the mishap.
if the question is about you then best of luck to you.
after a few months he finally go over her and i was right there waiting.
yes, it is more than probable cause to suspect something is up.
i wish i didn't enjoy mayonnaise as much as i do.
because he is not a good or intelligent person.
perhaps you would like to pray about this matter.
i am not interested in a purely physical relationship.
it is best to be honest with him about your feelings.
girls can flirt and play hard to get with guys.
get a beer and enjoy yourself.
however, i feel like she is my friend now.
it depends on if you asked the husband or the wife.
most guys play hard to get so you may want to stop calling him which will lead to him calling you
does the child deserve to have a life such as the one that would be provided?
however, you ought to simply ask him and discover the truth.
i tell him directly, such as, "hey (man's name), i have been attracted to you for (length of time)."
would anyone care to exchange emails as pen pals?
perhaps discover which type she is.
if you would like to burn that bridge then yes, but if not then no.
it mostly depends on how long ago you separated and who chose to separate.
oh my, this is not going to end well no matter what.
they do not have the same things we do.
i would like to save this page for future references. what can i do?
yes, it was a sugar daddy relationship. i am half his age. do i have to quit my job?
do you see him every day?
get married to benefit all of you, even your child.
do not waste your time! later on you may ignore her or makeup depending on the situation.
it is because they want to have sex badly and cannot ask you.
they should like you for who you are and not your height.
is it bad if everyone thinks we are virgins even though we are not?
you can tell if he tells you that he loves you and treats you the same way.
hi there, welcome to the club.
if they threaten you, then tell somebody you know or call the police.
i would bet that you do not have even one girlfriend.
but i do agree that women tend to evade the main points of a topic.
it is your wedding, which will hopefully only occur once, so be creative and enjoy yourself.
you do not have to say it.
it is an affection you share with someone, but not necessarily sex related.
why do people ask dumb questions?
guys like girls that just be themselves; it works for me.
i am not sure, i am thinking on that too.
have you ever heard of getting a divorce and fighting with him?
even i would not desire to have than for my significant other.
do not go on another date with him until after you decide.
do you want to risk having none?
what if he gets a divorce with his wife and you mar her life?
first he dribbles. then he shoots. finally, he scores and receives two points.
does the man that is attracted to your friend know you are attracted to him?
it is possible that you could attempt to earn his affections by writing him a letter. i have done the same thing previously.
i have previously been a bridesmaid and have, in doing so, had to walk down a spiral staircase.
my belief is that it is not abnormal.
maybe you should think about that when persuading your woman to trust you with her feelings and life.
are you asking which you should go with?
if you are a girl, please yourself with a pillow and then you can feel it.
you have to accept one thing.
i do not want to know some of my guy friends after hearing them speak like that.
would a gift certificate for the spa be good?
because they do not. most likely money and diamonds.
you people think impure thoughts, like i do.
or do not interact with them (as in no meeting, talking, messages, etc.) for a few days.

that is how it all begins.
if you discover most any girl looking at someone excessively, they like that person.
are the evangelists accosting you in the shopping center?
i guess you can wear them on your head for waves.
do not let them change you.
i think that is the best.
too many women do nothing but give!
be honest, do not lie, and explain why it is over.
it can be more than one song.
you can do it for approximately fifty dollars. you merely need to file for it at the local court house.

allow him time to process that information, as it is a lot to comprehend. he should understand, but do not force him.
i have always wondered about this one.
obviously, there are no guarantees.  even waiting until marriage does not mean never having any problems.
my friend, why should you be jealous of her?
masturbating is normal.  while not masturbating is abnormal.
the one consideration is the way in which they made conversation.
if you truly have feelings for him, then communicate this to him.

even though the most important attribute is personality, physical appearance also has significance.

it would appear as if you like both of them.
in fact, i did not really give you any advice, now that i think of it.
give her some space, and do what she wants.
do what is in your heart.
stand outside, and shout, "i want an email address now!"
but before that big commitment , i have to experiment with my choices.
i want the truth because i have always wondered and most men are obsessed about size.
i moved on and am happy with my new family now.
i could type for a long time, but i have t ogo do some work!
my love is not for sale.
as a female would that be something that would turn you off?
he said if he finds another female partner, he will stop seeing me.
once someone has broken your trust, you should not ever trust them again.
tell him you are a lesbian.
certainly not; their baby is the fruit of their love.
it makes it more effective that way.
do not worry about it until you are twenty five.
not everybody enjoys the same things.
did the parents warn you or something?
i do not give it to her raw.
love is not slow or fast and will appear when you least expect it.
my number is lost.  may i have yours?
i really want her to be happy.
there are many creative ideas.  ask her opinion first.
this is the reason i advise abstinence until marriage.
do not end the relationship for a long as several weeks.
she does not have the gumption to arouse me enough to participate.
it is appropriate if you choose to remain friends.
yes, i would be worried.
kissing her neck is a very intimate gesture.
too bad you have to beg.
if you are not in a relationship, there is nothing wrong with exploring all options.
before you give him a second chance, get a prenuptial agreement specifically stating if he cheats you get everything.

the bible says sex before marriage is wrong.
you need to be patient.
my husband lost his sexual appetite as he got older.
i am unaware of the price.
make sure you love her and then just pursue her, remember, women like romance.
because if you err in your speech, then you are not feeling that way about them.
what turns me off is when men believe they can date any girl they desire, it annoys me so much.
her love and affections should be forever cherrished and save for one man for her entire life.
obviously she is a lucky girl to have a man who is actually concerned about her happiness with him.
it will stop him if you change your phone number.
i believe for most men it is during.
focus on everything that brings you joy and not him.
being with a jealous person is no way to live and so i broke up with her.
my fiance came home and told me that he cheated on me last week.
okay, stop responding rudely to my questions.
there are three: nice heart, body, and way of thinking.
that is only me. other women have different feelings and thoughts. we are all different.
she is oblivious; they are not meant to be together. he is an unfaithful liar.
it is good that she does as well, because it means she loves you.
you know what, if she is shallow enough to be concerned with things like that, then who needs her?
if that is what you are asking, the answer is, "yes, it is very normal."
is there any advice on this?
did it not seem to be enough having a distant companion?
that is the best advice i can give you.
he dribbles the ball, throws it, and makes the shot for two points.
wait, why are you rushing?
it would be preferable to live without your significant other's family, if you can afford it.
if you are there for love, then get some counselling on how to solve the problems.
i would do anything she wants.
so why do you men cheat?
the only thing i look for in a guy is a partnership.
he has a girlfriend and i have a boyfriend.
say goodbye. i meant it, you deserve better.
i do not think he should ask unless he knows it is what you are into.
do you mean the song by toni baxton? he was not man enough. i agree with you, my friend.
you are merely attempting to discover yourself.
but i was ignorant and told him to stop calling me, which he complied with.
i think i understand why she ended the relationship with you.
i do not mind if she is ignorant or vain. as long as she is attractive i will be happy.
there are always nice women in that location.
some desire a penis the similar in size to a fire hose and others do not.
firstly, you ought to have directed him to the rejection hotline.
if other people do not like it then look away.
not merely due to receiving fellatio.
firstly, it depends whether you would like to be serious immediately or not until later.
i would most likely not ever actually wear the glasses but they are pleasant looking.
you ought to read it and discover for yourself.
i desire him very strongly.
i waited for four years while, in contrast, my sister waited nine months.
who likes a disingenuous person?
i love my boyfriend and i know he loves me.
is it something that you are not doing?
yes, i would, but it depends on where he might move.
it closes the deal with you start to pull your head back and end with a regular kiss.
what would the perfect guy be like?
we are the guys from school who did not get all the girls.
my boyfriend uses primatene mist, an over the counter inhaler.  i hope this helps.
do you know the people he knows?
i am not blonde and every man is attracted to me.
i do not think ethnicity should matter.
well, have you spoken with with about it?
and why would she want a man that cheated on his wife.
i want to remain friends with both of you.
and we love each other as much as we did seventeen years ago.
make her feel as though she is the most attractive woman alive. use candles for lighting.
the woman with whom i should spend the rest of my life.
do not be foolish enough to settle for less than you are worth and have coitus with strangers.
not too obese or too thin.
god only wants love to be between a man and a woman.
i enjoy doing nice things for my man.
sometimes honesty is best; do not stall, tell her you are waiting.
if you advertise here you must not be very attractive.
excuse me, but she is his sister.
i know how painful that can be.
it seems that a lot of women hate to see the man in their life get close to his sister.
i would be really worried if i were you.
if you have to ask that, then you have bigger problems than just finding a girlfriend.
i can only go one day without it.
no, not unless she is really close to your family.
that seems pretty average.
he should not be flirting with anyone except you.
she is almost as cute as me.
i do not know what you heard about him, but he is a pimp.
he likes this girl, but he wants it to be serious.
this is the honest truth.
every time i am around her i feel as if she is looking at me and sneaking in cheap feels.
it depends on whether or not you believe in love at first sight.
if your husband said yes, it is not fair.
some girls do and others do not.
my new boyfriend got a female roommate and i do not like it.
your first mistake was allowing him to have sex with you even though you were not a couple anymore.
i think girls do it because they want to be an adult and not date younger men.
you seem to have answered your own question.
they are not of much importance to many men.
if the answer is yes, did you become acquainted with someone there?
simply accept things as they occur.
each time, simply consider the consequences you will face later.
what kind of questions may i ask?
then you have women who try to change men to do what they want.
yes, it hurts because we are close, but it also feels good.
i am a guy, so i believe i know what i am talking about.
i just do not know what to do.
are you exchanging money for his love.
i advise you stay with your husband, as you may develope the habit of leaving relationships.
you cannot force a man to ask for your hand in marriage.
if you continue to have sexual relations with him, and if you continue to tell him you love him, that may be effective.
i do not know how to handle this situation; i do not find him appealing.
you will be unhappy if you are constantly worrying about what she or anyone else thinks.
when you return (safely, get a ride if you are inebriated), have good coitus with her and tell her how much you love her.
if there is a struggle, then try counselling.
so i smiled, then frowned again and walked away.
of course it is your decision.
this is the lesson: do not insert yourself into other people's marriages.
why do you believe this is true?
it appears to be brown, like coffee with cream in it; or it could be green.
the next time this happens you must require that he swear on his own life.
men are attracted to women who have appealing features and an attractive body.
maybe you are looking in all the wrong place.
he will treat me like a porn star and pull out!
then again, if that is what the two of you decide, it is right for you.
at what part did you become selfish.
to be "a flirt" you would have to of actually flirted with someone before.
i have a friend... and he is exactly the type of person i would have loved to get to know better.
it all depends on what he enjoys doing.
if bad did not exist neither would good.
you should not go through with it, if she is not your true love, after you may break up.
first, i want to assure you that god will not be offended.
if you believe it is morally wrong, then do not try to excuse it.
he is unintelligent and it sounds as though he used you.
i am not pregnant but i understand.
put out a personal advertisement in the newspaper. it is effective.
i am five feet and nine inches tall, so she could be just half an inch shorter.
and now i miss him so much and want to resume our relationship.
did you ever meet that guy who only dates girls with dd size breasts.
i believe that man thought you were pretty.
he might not think that and may be looking for some other.
be flirty but not too much, and wear your hair down to look cute and available.
take your time and give him the best answer.
i heard this from a friend.
please, do everyone a favor and do not have any kids.  you should think about why you are even married?
there is no need for you to think too much about what you have to do.
later, she may or may not want guys.  still, she would do it anyway!
you should contact me at the address i give you!
for a date with a beautiful woman, i need a good scary movie.
he did not make any remarks, so i took it to mean the affirmative.
tell him to call you after school is let out that way you can talk with him about it.
is it not possible that she does not like me?
no matter your sexual preference, it is up to you to decide how to conduct your life.
in the past, it was a big ordeal. nowadays, it's not as big of a issue.
i completely agree with you.  i am tired of seeing those questions on this!
you guys still sharing a bond even after you broke up.
talk to her.  once you start talking, ask her if she wants to go out sometime!
i met my nice guy through a friend.
you have nothing to worry about.  you are a little below average in size.
it appears you are already doing it!
you are correct.  i am confused about this guy at my school!
if i masturbate too much will it harm the chances of having a baby?
he has issues with everyone i associate with.
when she realized how stupid she could have been, it is keeping it.
the song "i'll be missing you" by p. diddy.
i assume you were raised without your father present.
i merely tell them i had coitus with him.
i do not know what to say to you.
you know why the bride smiles when she walks down the aisle, correct?
it is not worth going to that if it means you have to lie.
however, remember that there might be a good reason why your friends do not like him.
take in the beauty of everything around you, whether natural or human-made.
if you really like him, then it is time to pursue!
some good things are a beautiful body, nice eyes and face, a hot body that is still slim, and some sensuous movements.
i got upset and left. i have not been back since then and it has been two weeks.
do not ever ask him questions that can not be answered in a satisfactory manner such as, "am i fat?".
if she is a good girl, no, she will wait until her wedding day.
go gay all the way.
heck no, it is not a good way to start your life.
either option is good, but an aggressive female is a positive trait.
it depends on who you are trying to screw.
what are your feelings about it?
you should follow your feelings because your dream is discouraging you.
i can think of no one better to ask than a truman.
it depends on whether or not the guy is nice.
i like girls somewhere in between.
do not misunderstand me, i do love to suck on the breast.
if it was painful, you should let him know.
i am an old fashioned male.
it depends, some blondes are not attractive, but not because of the hair.
both of her legs had a polio attack.
if not, then i am sure there are some other reasons that they have.
my brother always says i am lying, but i am not.
you should think, nobody likes a person who is boring.
if you do that it would force you into getting married.
i told him how i felt and he felt the same way! i was very surprised.
if that is the case, you are dating him for the wrong reasons.
do you know any women, in person, who can do that?
the part about marrying to be faithful to your husband is a falsehood.
yes, especially if you have done it with the wrong man.
how and what do i tell her?
i was wondering if people could share some good chat sites for marriage and those that are in trouble.
i would have to mention the bad teeth.
i had a similar situation, i was in love with my romantic partner but the dreams where far better than the reality of it all!
be certain that he is the one you are after or you could end up regretting it.
in general, for most people i know, the right people tend to show up where you are not actually seeking them.
in the movie pearl harbor, she gets the best of both world's as an actor!
you should inform him that if he does not comply the relationship is stagnate.
i am under the impression that someone has a strange attraction to feet.
the second time is significantly better than the first, and then it becomes perfect.
are you giveing her time for her emotions.
that is highly entertaining with a female as its source.
she does not want to participate in sexual intercourse with you.
preoccupy yourself with worthwhile things and gain some sense before someone has to forcibly give it to you.
continue observing him moving for a short amount of time and then look again.
believe me, a woman and a man will have platonic feelings sooner or later.
currently, this man would like to marry you.
i am not attracted to women similar to paris hilton, she looks emaciated.
he should not, however he is and you must deal with the consequences.
if you think of someone constantly at all hours of the day then you are truly in love.
that is funny, as long as it does not cause hardship for her or her relations.
get somebody with some experience for that.
he left an apologetic message.
i will only sleep with my husband.
some females use chat because they cannot be seen.
he should have just kept his mouth shut forever.
does she appear happy or like someone just ran over her dog.
it depends, try it and see.
the answer is because i have a friend that turns me on.
what do you want your lover to do for you?
i don't run, so let's do this!
there is no way they could really have something negative to say about every person they know.
if you look around she may be there.
don't immediately go to physical punishment, try talking to him first. if the talking doesn't work then you may need to resort to physical punishment.
use your mind to overcome your poverty.
it's hard for mothers like me to trust people.
all i can think of are them.
most girls don't like it but some do.
their marriage only lasted for three years.
the grass is not greener on the other side.
i believe they are receiving compensation without disclosure as it is their occupation.
you will find a unique and exceptional man on infrequent occasions.
do not invest any more thought into it as he is obviously not your equal.
i agree, do not be concerned with the thoughts of others.
if you trust him, why not?
i return home for a vacation every year to see him again.
that was a large amount to read and absorb.
be creative, have a ball. alright, have a jar instead.
you only have one life, everyone should be happy.
the biggest problem is the fact that your dream guy is only a dream.
that would be the only possible downfall.

the thing i love from the bible is the willingness to work for the benefit of others.
i have not seen him in seven years!
i am suffering agonizingly because i want her back immediately.
however, we must remember that we cannot find a best friend until we become a best friend.
ladies, is the first time painful?
your circumstances will never return to the current state if you begin a romantic relationship.
make him aware of your feelings, do not intentionally mislead him.
another possibility is your lack of knowledge concerning love.
you have to wait for them to heal.
i do not know if it affects anything,but i have always used tampons.
i thought people got married for better or for worse.
i get very horny, but women are pretty unavailable to me.
ian is a thirteen year old blond teenager.
surrounding yourself with friends and trying new things is a beneficial way to stay busy.
people who have someone in life to call a best friend should be greatful.
it may be time to tell her that you do not share the same feelings that she has for you.
would you like for me to rub your feet?
take a chance and let your luck guide you.
also, tell her that dr. phil often says, "if they will cheat with you, then they will cheat on you."
also, from your post i believe you are too young to be in love this way.
this man who i am interested in has been speaking with another woman.
yes, unless you are bad, there is no reason not to.
be as creative as you want.
here come another one for you to try to get.  wait, that is my boss.
i am too nervous to ask if he likes me or not!
they know what each other will say before they say it.
he is single right now and really cute.
i certainly have a problem with that.
that was a joke.
i wouldn't do that if i didn't know the man that i was with.
i hope you do well.
do you understand me?
if you fail, you can always start over.
it is only dating and not at all illegal.
you should not lie to your wife if you love her.
most men claim to love girls and treat them nice simply as an investment for sex.
i noticed you assaulted your partner today.  would you like to try to assault me?
yes, if that does not work then shave your genitals and buy some good adult entertainment.
if she does not, then she is not interested in being friends anymore.
am i just being over emotional or is he controlling and should i say something?
yes, you should of you really like this guy.
if you honestly feel all of the above then that is love!

i am very nervous.

some women will have an orgasm, and some are not able to.
if you like him then give it a try, but move slow.
i have not spoken to her is a few days.
what would you like to talk about?
5th grade is too young to learn about that subject.
still take the child support and the courts cannot do anything in reality.
you will get better results if you try it.
winter makes your dress dirty.
a lot of new friends to have fun with.
if you leave her alone, she will quit coming around.
tell her how much you love and miss her, and can not wait to see her again.
it hurts me that i can not be the girl he wants.
or, she may just be teasing you.
if he is okay, of course!
you should leave if you are there for your children.
i want to find a good, local woman.
i typically wear sweat pants when i am just hanging around.

between six and seven is above average while seven and higher is enormous.
go to bed with them so that they will not be jealous.
there is no such thing. i would have it every five minutes if that were possible.
what is the 1% that is missing?
does he like me or not?
leave her alone and give her some time.
someone once told me that if you even have to ask whether or not they are cheating then the probably are.
that sounded mean. i did not mean it like that.
be sure she is comfortable and move slowly.
my problem is i do not have a large penis, approximately 5 inches, and i am only able to engage in intercourse for four-to-six minutes.
do not laugh in a manner producing a distasteful sound through your nose, do not become inebriated, and do not smoke excessively.
what is your question in reference to?
what type of question are you asking?
you do not need to explain anything to him.
you should wait until you are sure.
we do not want to look like idiots lusting after men, with our tongues drooling.
you should take your time, find the right person, get married, and then you can have sex all day!
it does not really mean either of those, it can mean going on a date, or just hanging out.
tell them to be quiet and mind their own business!
sometimes she is mean to you.
of course people do this all the time now because of hiv and aids.  however, most are too selfish.
be yourself and do not worry.
a good sign to make you move is if she smiles and laughs a lot with you.
he desires to take advantage of the situation.
simply because she had sex with you is no reason to trust her.
this is air supply, from their album all out of love.
i believe it is the desire to be loved in the same manner that you love the other person.
you cannot make him love you, nor should you attempt to do so.
you start walking like each other because you both have developed the same bad habits.
cheating makes things worse in the end.
the reason why there are so few is because most women do not pursue the nice guy.
look and you will find the way.
allow her to be a lesbian if she identifies as one.
i have carried the weight of bills, childcare, etc., for years and i am fed up.
of course, if you are talking about in bed it depends on what she is like.
the guy is going to have a good laugh.
do you seriously want to do that?
why in the world am i with him?
yes, i hope i answered your question.
i have not really met anyone from a different race.
if he is not, then leave him.
she should not be bothering a married man because it is wrong.
wear protection, try to make her feel as comfortable as possible, and take things extremely slow.
no love is for all, no matter what sex they are.
if people lie in real life then you know they will lie behind a computer screen.
only two, my wife and my best friend.
it is what is inside that ultimately counts.
i am on birth control and my boyfriend is not pressuring me at all.
men are strange but remember that most men will not tell you they are with someone, already.
maybe the timing was not right. you should invite her to do something to keep her busy.
down there, if you understand what i mean.
i do not think there should be a trick to it.
concerning advice, i do not know.
you were unfaithful to him yet you do not trust him?
i notice strange phone numbers on his phone often but he says it is work-related.
maybe. if they're childhood friends from a very young age.
i honestly fell in love with a person that is overweight.
if you are talking about a jealous boyfriend or girlfriend, then you should leave!
i agree with "angelpop993" and "butterballs"!
you are human if you are just sexually aroused.
i want it all of the time.
another young man told him, "oh, don't do it!"
that is probably all you can do right now!
don't expect things will go smoothly.
how about we get together for lunch, later?
you should not have to do anything as long as you are good to her.

yes, "how old are you?" though, and be prepared if he replies negatively.
that is fine if you merely desire to be referred to as pat.
hurting her will solve nothing.
it would be wrong only if a person is planning on cheating.
i would just call and say, "what's up?"
blah blah blah. grow some hair and then we'll talk about this stupid question.
listen. i always forget other people do what i want to do.
when i got married, my mother told both of us that a marriage is 50/50.
well, it depends on where you live, i guess.
that means that they love you no matter what.
i hate receiving oral, but i love performing it on my husband... yum.
first, talk to your parents, then talk to that girl.
teenager who have babies are so fun.
the bible tells you, you don't, you meet women.
open your mind, revenge can cause you another heartache.
i, for one, refuse to take out the trash; that's just me.
put on some lipstick and impress him with your personality.
you should wait until they break up, then comfort her.
actually, he does not go in at all.
a room with a jacuzzi tub.
6 is afraid of 7 because 7 8 9.
only those who also want you.
i think i would know because i am a guy.
you're not shallow, you just know what you want.
you just need to talk to him and decide what is best for your relationship.
if you really want to know just ask your parents.
there are so many good things we should learn!
i messed up the procession and remained grumpy for the rest of the day.
bad macho boys have abusive relationships. they turn me off.
if he or she says no, then you saved yourself from some heartache.
if you do not date, you will not know if he is the one.
are you the guy who likes to chew on mice necks?
to me, sexy is not just how somebody looks.
so ask him, then if he says no get over it!
what is wrong with this picture?
i do not think men have to lie about cheating.
interesting idea, but no, i do not think so.
it's the real deal with real people and the feeling of fear.
i am going to guess that you are in the 7th or 8th grade.
iv'e always dated older guys, i'm 31 and by boyfriend is 4 years older.
that is why a lot of marriages can last up to 50 years.
just ask your mom if you can date him.
i would be interested in meeting you.
be careful, you do not want personal information to surface.
you either love her or you do not.
initiate contact with him by running into him. then you can respond with a smile and start talking to him.
this is a quality that we are interested in.
okay, i appreciate you sharing that.
you are very self centered.
because most men think with their eyes and not their brain.
i think you should ask him and then decide.
those would not be of any help.
i used to own a jewelry store and i would never buy anything on the internet. buy local.
it is not possible he is 235, not even on a good day.
i would either ignore him or say hello based on the details of the break-up.
i'd say to do your best.
it is as if he's willing to forget the lies, so good luck with your relationship :)
of the books i listed below, read some of them.
some girls do not prefer that.
i think i'm in love with my boyfriend, and i think he feels the same, but i am not sure.
people do not understand irony. it is very subtle, and most people are not subtle.
people enjoy fun people, not people who are shy or anti-social.
you should give it to her.
we are friends, but i really want to ask her on a date.
trust me, you will not want an older man.
more thinks to talk about, men and women.
i am not the dress and cake kind of person.
do not get too sensitive in the letter.
try online dating. avoid username's similar to the current one.
if you are interested, let him know that you would like to go, and ask if he would like to join you.
it was much cheaper for us, we saved alot of money.
i am not certain, but it sounds like you may be in love.
my girlfriend and i learned a tricked we have named 'the bedroom grandstanding', and it is alot of fun.
as long as you both enjoy it and its safe, then it is ok to be adventurous.
send out the invitations, do everything you have been dreaming about and deserve!
i am a little upset because i had a fight with my husband.
invest in a vibrator called "the rabbit"; it takes a little practice, but you can pleasure yourself.
if you are a hateful person, you should be nicer.
maybe you could entertain yourself with somebody else's toys.
ask yourself if you can see yourself with this person thirty years from now.
let her know that you do not expect anything and you should be fine.
men think that their genitalia is a great thing.
women think the same thing as well.
they skipped having a wedding and eloped, and then on their tenth anniversary they had a formal ceremony and a reception.
you have our support, now go and find a solution to this problem !
all right, have you connected offline and in real life ?
furthermore, i did not have a jacket !
and then pornography comes to the rescue.
if she doesn't know, just wait.
how do you know if you can ever truly trust them?
i believe that is true for some men.
there are great men out there!
what is she complaining about?
never tell her that you are interested in her.
i was as happy as i could be.
it depends on the quality of your friends.
it happened to me too and i told her to leave.
she wants him to grow up.
have a wonderful ballon birthday.
you'll know when you find the man of your dreams.
it's been a long time and i still don't have it yet.
it takes a mature woman to give this to her spouse.
you are really going with the person because of the looks.
sometimes, they use it for other purpose and irregular periods.
blow him a kiss, and then say, "so, what's up?"
so, do you think i am in love?
do you know anything else about her besides movies and food?
are you talking to her without your wife present?
you should remain with him.
her name is skye and she is nice to me.
if he will not come, are you sure you want to be with him?
you are making the girl very bored.
have one of your friends to do the same thing, the worst that he could say is, "no".
i like all the positions equally.
i would like someone to tell me what true love is because whenever i think i have it, i do not.
he did not do that all the time.
i stand up for myself, my husband, and our son!
you will be in a lot of trouble if you let them control your life.
i honstly believe that white men can date more black women than they think they can.
it is commonplace that the sight of a beautiful woman naturally stirs a pubescent male's hormones.
however as life continued, everything progressed very quickly.
dear girls, please don't worry. it is true that boys display immaturity, but it is their youth, and they will display more positive characteristics as they mature.
please do not be heavy handed with her. this if for her a new beginning.
your bed should be at a certain temperature, regardless of any sexual activity, but warmth in the bed itself.
simply try to keep some distance between yourself and him if you are ill, as others have suggested.
no, not at all; many people do it.
if she says she does not have one, you can return later and ask her out.
move away; if her eyes are still closed, kiss her again.
if she is your mother, she can do as she pleases.
women tend to think that all women are them same.
you should convince her to wait because that is what a real friend would do.
do you want somebody like that to be your friend?
i find that it is much easier to not cheat nor lie.
age is not anything other than a number.
say hello and have a mutual friend whom you trust introduce you.
it is easy; i do it all of the time.
it is not your fault that mature men are interested in you.
boys do not have hot butts and they like the fact that girls do.
have a nice dinner out with yourself or someone special.
well, if you both have the proper anatomy i suppose it might be possible.
all he cares about is getting his peter wet. if he cared about you he would be showing it.
you are still 14 and there are a lot of great things out there and not just one girl.
what was it like to be a flower girl?
they are afraid  they will get in trouble if they admit to it.
you have a relationship with him, and she is jealous.
i am sure it is fine as long as it was strictly platonic.
if you don't think you did anything wrong, then in your mind, you didn't.
i have heard many good things about the italian people.
it is my thought that you shouldn't go out looking for love.
if he is the right one, he won't mind waiting until you two are married.
i don't find bars or dance clubs appealing.
he needs you now more than he ever did!
do not act like a child; it really is not that difficult.
i do not believe in destiny.
boys are always trying to be jokesters, even when nothing is funny.
do you have experience, because it will hurt when it is her first time.
they like american and european men.
maybe people will think this is normal after 10 to 20 years.
now he and i are best friends.
if you end up together, great! though take it one day at a time.
ask yourself this: how do i feel about him?
perhaps you are not home.
fulfill your responsibilities and do not give any credence to the opinions of your ex.
why do you wish to hurt someone you previously loved?
yes, it is true; what can you do to prevent it?
it does happen, and what you said about love is true.
i think everyone is good in their own way.
if you are busy doing housework and just do not feel up to it, too bad.
it depends on how you carry the relationship moving forward.
you could kill her boyfriend.
yes, it is okay.  if you are sure of yourself you do not care.
i went to a club and got one and it was very fun.
because black men are so hot.
honestly, you are too young.
it should be long enough to penetrate from behind in order to compete with other guys.
if you would like, i will be a friend.
yes, only if you are close friends
personally, i do not mind guys who love their mothers.
i hate guys that do not want to be with any other people.
to twenty three; that sounds like the right idea.
i don't mind; i think it's cute.
i tried a relationship with someone older; it didn't work.
you have to listen to it and take notes.
chances are better if they are both homosexual.
but, it takes a few flubs.
most adults don't know the difference either, so do not feel bad.
i say no for soulless sex because i love and care about someone.
i would stop talking to him.
i guess men are giving out the wrong impression.
also, most guys that want to date me are only interested in taking my virginity.
try to see what occurs.
my friends and i used to be extremely close.
there are a lot of disingenuous individuals around.
do not ask. if they do, you will know.
look in the phone book for the family's name.
if he gets mad at you for asking then break up with himq
almost every guy wants to have sex with you.
it shows that you have noted something about her.
it's true that i do agree with cutecurl gal.
most guys are somewhat bold but still wait for the signal from the girl to make the mov.
some people prefer a lot of saliva while others find that disgusting.
if you take her to the movies and show her a good time she should fall for you.
i truly hate my ex-mother in-law.
afterward, i told my best friend the great news.
embrace, polish, and refine all of your interests... for example, suppose you enjoy reading.
if you want to talk to him, i'd recommend simply doing so.
if they do not invite you, invite yourself.
before we continue, did you ever get your girlfriend out from under the truck?
oh my goodness, are you just a young child?
if you are a good person living in a bad family it can be really hard.
when we are young teenagers we are not aware of what real love is..
i asked the question before and was told it was not normal to do it.
should it not be the same way for women?
to offer him love and prosperity.
just stay calm and be careful.
what matters is that i love her son.
i have heard that phrase before, and it does seem to work.
he is just a guy. there are many more guys in the world.
was i mistaken to believe she owed me an explanation?
i will not break up with anyone. i believe in being accepting and non-judgemental.
the first step would be to e-mail me.
if only she was your sixth cousin once removed
i wish i could tell him without ruining their friendship.
tell her you love her as much as you possibly can.
together, we had one son and one girl.
lose some fat before talking to him again.
so i felt really bad because she was really hot.
so, yes, they can just be friends.
maybe use them to satisfy yourself?
not gay, unless if you are imagining to do it with a guy.
if you are 13 and you have not found your true love, then don't worry. you have plenty of time.
my ideal guy is someone who is patient and selfless.
why does my ex-boyfriend care who i speak to if we are not together anymore?
it depends on girl and the status of her relationship.
i cried when she passed away and i was only eleven years old.
you have to be happy with yourself.
do what is good for you.
please do not include religious ideas.
my apologies, i did not intend to go on a tangent.
if he does not, then he truly likes you.
i do not think that viewing adult videos is infidelity.
wait for her response.
look for your target standing alone observing their surroundings.
are you looking for something temporarty yet fun and exciting?
you can tell by her sacrifice and by the way she looks at you.
if her answer is no then you may ask her out.
it sounds like you have a good man.
especially if it is with someone we love and knows the right moves,
i like guys that do not care about a girls looks.
anyway, i love looking at my own breasts now.
you can see guy's sincerity through it.
maybe he had to but still did not want to leave you.
i hope you did no take offence.
but a long as they are just looking and touching i do not see anything too harmful about that.
i married my best friend and our sex life is still fabulous after five years.
i treat them the way i do with anyone else who does not have hiv.
you do not need to convince your boyfriend that you are not talking to other men.
you are too decent for all of that.
be smart, witty, and have a nice sense of humor.
you will know their lifestyle by taking them to these places.
hun, think about your safety and your kids' safety.
how do i go about doing this?
at least wait until you are not jail bait.
however, he still stares at me like he loves my looks, or something.
most of my friends are guys because i have issues with women.
is it wrong to go out with my ex's best friend shortly after we broke up?
please figure this out. if you do not, you are going to be hurt.
i say you should just go for it.
i am afraid if she goes alone, so i am thinking i might go along with her.
yes, he wants it because he thinks it is sexy.
i am getting married in june of 2006 and would love your advice on what colors are good at that time of year.
when asking questions, watch their eyes; they may be lying if they look up and to the left.
i would say yes, pursue this.
as was mentioned previously, hey what's up works wonders.
there was a time i did not and despaired about ever finding anyone to love me.
middle school starts in 6th grade.  does high school start in 8th grade? does 5th or 4th grade considered the end of primary school?
if anyone have advice about my situation, please inform. thanks.
having sex with someone you love is great. don't stop.
you should not put the blame on women.
if he loves you, he'll be back. that's what they all say.
i am interested in any position that might be available.
if you happen to find a nice young man, you may feel inclined to end the relationship.
it is wise to keep an open mind, exercise caution and use common sense to avoid painful relationships.
it is important to avoid worrying about relationships because there is an abundance of available women to meet.
there is an abundance of available men in which to form a relationship.
learn from my mistakes.
being happy with yourself is important.
kiss his face after you hold him down.
it happened when i wasn't expecting it.
sometimes the boy will see it first.
no matter your size, confidence will always show.
i would like to know what your opinion is about why men cheat.
i am sure that they are good at love, but all people are.
if she is unable to find anyone outside of her family, that is very sad.
do you own a zoo, or a type of museum?
i'm uncertain of where you came from, but in this area, parents don't name their daughters frank.
take caution and care, you wouldn't want to hurt her by doing your stuff.
if your children are adamant about befriending this, then advise them to not associate with you any longer.
this girl is showing signs of admiring you.
immediately upon marriage, you are able to file for his legalization.
he does not really hug me, so, i do not think he particularly cares for me.
hope this helps and good luck.
he thinks he still has rights over you because he still likes you.
she freaks out when she does something wrong.
you should say yes if he wants you back.
i would suggest that the best course of action would be to move on.
many animals do: monkeys, cows, sheep, etc.
all of the men i have dated have committed indiscretions or have been unsuccessful gamblers.
i can understand not drinking alcohol, however i am struggling to comprehend the principle behind not dancing.
i never have and i never will.
i have a boyfriend. how long have you been together?
i love it and will not change it.
think about your feelings, and then give yourself an opportunity with the other person.
i am unable to give you any further advice, but good luck!
a girl's interpretation would be: "best friends forever!"; while a boy's version would be, "big fat fart."
don't tell him you love him!
well, not unless you know when they are lying or not. hope this helps.
so, just be open and tell her you like her.
if you think bad about your chat, then stop it sooner.
why are you even asking that question?
he's not right for you if he can't meet your standarts.
you could do something that pleases the crowd.
being attracted to only one sex is better than being attracted to both sexes.
some prefer men who are always around and others prefer men who are casual.
simply advise her that he's not interested in her.
you are not close enough to him to dream of marriage at this point.
to find my knowledge about this, was a hard occurrence.
take care in advising her, for her feelings may be hurt.
what about the guys who wait in-line to get on with you?
i hope not; that would be horrible.
friendship would be acceptable, but deeper intimacy would not work, as i recognize it could interfere with their love for their spouse.
if i feel it is right for my family, i proceed.
i would advise you not to concern yourself with it.
i would go out with him again, if he asked.
if you are dating a 16 year old girl, then that is a problem in itself.
it is her job and she treats it professionally.
however, as with anything else, some are really stupid.
i know you will make it through this!
sometimes it is not bad to fight about silly things.
spend time with him, and give him hints and clues that you would like to be more than just friends.
sometimes you can be friends with your exlover, or you can break up with them.
i am a simple girl who is not interested in material things; i am interested in physical contact and real emotions.
true love is about sharing and sacrifice; it is about liiving with someone that you cannot live without.
love is one of those feelings that you just know; but cannot put into words.
i am sixteen years old now, so i have not done it yet.
you may want to consider removing the bun in your hair.
here is an important piece of information that you will find helpful.
if i want it done, i would be happy to guide you to the place where you are needed.
it feels as though i am ignored when the new girl decides to hang out with our group.
i understand your point; however, i find him incredibly attractive.
you are not cabable of knowing, nor will you ever obtain this knowledge.
my darling, you reqire a man to resolve your problems.
you must not disregard the impact of your non-verbal communication.
he may later resent me if i refrain from taking action.
my boyfriend (whom i adore) is 39.
i prefer to not partake in it. is it not cheating?
if a female were to cheat on a male, they they are considered 'hoes'.
as i advised before, the girl appears to be interested!
if she gives consent, then go for his bf.
i simply tell her that it is flattering, but he is too young.
do not worry if you have not reached a decision yet.
also, verbally explain it to him; that should get his attention.
hello there- you answered my question, but never gave me your email address so that i could instant message you.
i feel there is more distance between my friends and i of late.
all you have to do is remember what it was like for you at that age.
it is all a part of growing up.
my heart was broken twice by the same guy.
try being nice to someone you like.
do not put labels on it or he may get sacred.
i do think it is strange, however.
yes, especially if you want children.
i did not think they did those any longer.
if it does not, you will sabotage everything with only a simple comment.
you have yet to kiss the right girl.
have you tried looking in new hampshire?
go and tell him the truth with an apology.
i spyed on my ex and it turms out her was cheating on me.
be her friend first.
around a month ago, we admitted that i liked her. i love her but she only likes me. do you have any suggestions?
just say that you're sorry: tell him that you made a mistake and didn't mean what you said. then maybe he will take you back.
it sounds like you're fantasizing a lot about him.
believe it or not, most people don't think about this. on the other hand, it could be your breath.
women, it's not like a man trying to find the g-spot, which is hidden and tiny.
i am terrible at making friends except for the instances where i am smiling
how can we make this entertaining?
you want to know what i think would be fun?
how do you know he still loves you because i might be seeing somebody else.
age is only a number.
being intelligent is important to me.
girls understand you better and connect with you more when you have difficulty in your life.
but, if you don't really know him, then get to know him and then answer.
it's nothing; it's hard to find a good man currently; i empathize with you.
love letters, little surprises, something that shows him how much you think of him and how much you care.
i like a firm behind, one that makes you want to just grab on to and not let go.
obviously some people are destined to be alone, but i hope it is not you.
but just what kind of job is it?
but do not wait around for him to ask you.
we got together without considering the consequences, and it was not very nice.
my husband and i got married last august and i love him very much.
it is okay to be afraid, the next step is to find out why.
you can reach me by email anytime.
please be careful, it is addicting
does it bother you that they are females?
how old did you inform him that you were?
in my opinion, you need to wait until you are a legal adult.
it is for a scavenger hunt, like the one shown on the movie "sleepover".
i reccommend informing her parents or a teacher.
some parents are okay with that, so good luck.
because size always does not matter, but it matters how he treats you and how you really feel about him.
there are other times that i see her staring at me, out of the corner of my eye.
just say to her that i think i am falling in love with you.
it is easy, do the "humpty dumpty," hump her, then dump her.
i need help with this because i do not know how to tell this person i love him.
maybe they have not looked in a mirror at all and seen themselves.
because you date guys, who are jerks.
it is because men at that age want to feel that they are still young.
everyone does it at this age.
tell me about your other ladies.
if he likes you, he most likely will not listen to your ex.
it is harmless unless your boyfriend is seeing that person.
try taking yourself out of the situation if it fails.
you need to tell him how badly you want it.
try doing that at work if it's feasible.
i am not a drug addict.
our interest in each other is mutual.
you might be able to learn something from my husband.
if that fails, try asking nicely.
i do not believe those that are young should be sexually experimenting.
that is a lot to do if you are only mildly interested in him.
she said, "if you want your marriage to fail then go in the chat rooms."
they are fine with expensive jeans and shirts.
when he stops calling you or lack showing any interest such as being distant.
can someone tell me, does love exist?
and girls will spread rumors about you to get you two to break up.
you should move on and relax with an adult beverage.
my only advice is to move on.
i like athletes as well, as do most of my friends, with the exception of my lesbian friends, of course.
it is not that i do not like her, it is simply that i want time to collect my thoughts and be alone for awhile.
the back yard for a barbecue.
it is getting better, however, i have very little money at the moment.
in addition, you do not have to change any diapers or pay for college.
what can i do to become closer to him?
what was the funniest thing that happened?
if you become scared and panic, the right guy will chase after you.
i think it happened when i was a kid.
fifteen years is alright but twenty-two is far too many.
enter your zip code in the advance search box.
she only wanted him for sex.
i am in love with him so i cannot fantasize about anyone but him.
i would like to have online sex.
if you want to grab his attention then forget it!
you can have him to take your last name just the way i did.
my dad is white and my mom is black.
just be yourself and certainly do not pretend to be something you are not -- liars are always found out.
do you like it when a guy is always on point, at the drop of a dime, always willing?
but you are heartbroken and unhappy without one.
do not pretend to be someone you are not.
it do not care weather it is making love or fucking!
she cares about him as well.
my ex did that.
after 15, i was no longer a virgin. i have not thought about it since.
i had a lot of fun as a maid of honor.
there are many signs of being in love.
invite some friends to sleepover and ask him to join in.
how can i heal and move past it?
it is valid if his behavior upsets you.
he will know you are no longer interested.
it is obvious: flirt more than they do.
if it feels good, do it.
of course, that would be preferable, however some people succumb to peer pressure.
listen to the first woman; i agree with her.
treat him the way you would want to be treated.
excuse me, but does she know about this?
guys are shallow in that they do not like a girl because they find her to be large.
it would be nice to show off.
respect how he feels and be happy you have a perfect relationship.
there are two alternatives to how others will perceive you, and they will either have great affection for you or not.
this man will always remain in a state of sexual attraction.
my perception of the evidence bears that she is "with child."
as you approach your fortieth birthday, here are wishes to you for an enjoyable life.
it is now time for us to address your current matter of concern.
he is very quiet and enjoys playing playstation 2.
i do the majority of the housework, not because i need to, but simply because i do.
my girlfriend's older sister had the same difficulty.
it wouldn't be fair to your partner to throw them away like yesterday's garbage.
just go easy on them. they are the best in the way that they are. after all, not everyone is like that. (just kidding.)
there really isn't any way for you to do it yourself.
i know how to say "i'm sorry" in japanese, not chinese.
but in regard to freaky stuff, no one can say objectively what is good and what is bad.
what i mean is, are you going to be 18 this year?
when you find the answer could you please let me know?
i am not expecting it since it has been a while since i have been in love.
no thank you, you must be very rich to be going to pay for the calls if they come from very far away.
that would mean no begging, whining, or crying.
why do you want a boyfriend so badly?
send pictures, play something online, such as yahoo games or role playing games.
well, if you think it is cheating, then it is.
first, we must set something straight: not all women are unfaithful.
you will when you are older, and you have other issues to concern yourself with other than dating.
do not expect too much at first when you are not certain because i am afraid that you could become harmed.
you cannot do anything about it.
truly, though, i would not push anything.
two years, i believe, yes, and i just changed my avatar's clothes.
they are two irresponsible 14-year-old teenagers having sex out of wedlock because they cannot get married.
we each have our own boyfriend or girlfriend.
i am female and most of my friends are men.
she is quiet, pretty, and has a nice body. she does whine but hardly enough to notice.
if you truly love a man, you give him a bit extra.
someone with loving eyes magnetizes me through the way our eyes meaningfully contact.
she is sixteen, and not a good age for me.
my question is how come you are such a whimp ?
you are telling me that your girl's boyfriend took off.
what is the best approach to asking a girl for a date ?
please accept the advice and counsel of the individual named smert. the two of you should have an extended conversation.
and then, wen we me, i was somewhat interested.
in what respect do you think it was stupid?
you can be more productive by keeping busy with work and things your enjoy, such as a new hobby.
i am 15 years old, and my friend wants me to go with her to a guy's apartment.
after this, what will you be thinking the next time he is 10 minutes late?
love brings light upon your life.
a body that does not stop will not hurt at all!
what i mean't to say is go where he is and talk.
i never knew for sure but i always thought the town was gross.
i keep telling him that as well but he just keeps trying.

do i email him and ask how his christmas and new year went?
if he goes, you know the answer.
returning to your question: is it a sin?
say something like, "i think you are really cool. want to go hang out sometime?"
i know it is just eye contact.
maybe she has been cheating him all this time they have been going out.
i feel that a wife should please her husband.
when you're not together, give him some time and space without phone calls or texts.
does anyone else think that isn't right?
he went on to have other children younger than our son.
i would like to see it trimmed instead of shaved.
my older brother nicknamed me izzy, and people have called me that since then.
many married couples go to dinner and watch television while there.
do not be afraid to try to find out by asking her.
when we were together, he treated me well; i still have feelings for him.
men can be difficult, as they are fickle minded and different.
thank god i carefully had mine removed two years ago.
are the girls like the ones in american teen movies?
don't trip. you don't want him to say it to you unless he feels the same way, right?
tell her how much she means to you and that you really did not mean to hurt her.
maybe the two of you need more time to get acquainted.
i feel as though assertive men are slightly intimidating; i tend to gravitate towards men who are shy, much like myself.
i do not know her version of the events; did you anger her?
i've found that first dates are a great time to get acquainted with the other person.
we continue to have the same feelings for each other.
your left ring finger, the one next to your pinky finger.
it depends on what kind of girl.
the first time i was younger and immature, so it doesn't count.
it depends on you and a man that feels the same way.
just watch out for high water.
yes, you can walk her down to the isle.
why should he even bother if you are not going to put out?
i know at least 6 happy couples that met on eharmony. i've married two of them!
i've put too many guys on my stealth settings.
hey, i am dog girl's friend and i have a boyfriend that is japanese.
trust me, that boy will be begging to come back to you.
i am always here to talk, my yahoo id is "livinghaunted".
well, my friend hit her boyfriend on the head with a skillet, and he has not had a temper since.
true love lasts forever, however puppy love only lasts for so long.
i have been with women who have rather small breasts.
i notice that females are quite mysterious.
you are not required to have a male paramour.
a picture frame with a picture of you and him in it.
i simply approach a male and speak with him.
when would you sacrifice something for that individual?
it seems like he likes you. flirting with him will reveal the truth much more quickly.
you will also receive brand new socks.
invite your friends over to your house for pizza and movies, board game night, or some other fun event.
go ahead, take that first step.
your mother's main concern should be over you.
the mere fact of asking the question contains the answer.
one is sexual, while the other is not.
in some cases, men start their sex life at age 40; at that age they become more adventurous.
if you have to drink in order to enjoy yourself with him, you are better served to find more appropriate male company.
let us consider cases when your feelings about someone are not returned.
if you are proposed to by a woman, then you must agree to marry.
it takes more than love to fulfill a happy marriage.
does he associate with other females that he spends time without you being present?
of 4 other siblings, i am the youngest.
men have the prevalence of lying at the same rate of women.
i reccommend doing things that you both enjoy.
i have noticed a lot of questions about size, where does this stem from?
i do not want to hold it over people.
your family will make fun of you.
not any more than any other female.
you need to be yourself.
do not be over-confident or disingenuous.
his work ethic needs improvement.
begin by asking, "how are you? how are things? you are looking well. i was wondering if you would like to get together sometime."
yes, please let me know your phone number.
simply continue the relationship via sending messages and remaining loyal.
because they are insecure with themselves.
they are very common and of no particular value.
i also agree with the first speaker.
do you think i am attractive based on my avatar?
i like to watch with a man, especially inappropriate japanese cartoons.
it sounds like you should go to siu which is in carbondale, illinois.
do not do anything that you would later regret.
he should trust you even though you are talking to the other man.
when someone says they are "sending their love", that means the person is saying "hello".
because women are just a rib.
because they are babies for many reasons.
please respond to me if you want to be my friend.
that does not sound like the problem of a college-age person.
however, since she is married, you should not succumb to your feelings, but rather simply let it go.
be careful; you may find the proof you are looking for.
as long as they are good people and you truly complement each other, it is acceptable to be friends.
now to see if i can take my own advice.
i have not yet found my true love, but it is coming.
a women told me that she prefers a good stabbing in comparison to being tickled.
you should get over it and look for somebody else.
i know that because i am a man.
i tried and failed to help you and i apologize.
the next time i get into a relationship, i want a decent girl who has good morals.
i have seen people that are able to be friends with their ex's, but i am not able to do this.
many times, it is the man that cheats before the woman goes astray.
to be honesty with you, there is no other excuse other than, 'because we are guys'.
just leave him alone, dont keep in touch or communicate with him anymore.
don't care what other people think of him.
i know that this guy needs to forget about her.
that was the wrong thing to do, but i would date you.
i think using condoms makes it bad.
wow! i'm sorry, honey. that is a predicament.
you shouldn't care what your friends think of your actions.
the reason is because it makes us extremely nervous.
he believe that it gave him power.
i do not like large lips; however, i do appreciate voluptuous lips.
he is loves his father and is truly sorry, he would quickly apologize.
that way it would not be a shock. good luck.
which one can you see yourself having a future with?
alright, american women can be trusted.
firstly, that is clearly a lie.
the concept behind "makeing-out" does not appeal to me.
i agree, as it is most positive without sexual relations.
i must remove myself from the relationship, but i cannot do so under these circumstances.
i suggest that you continute to fornicate, and refrain from speaking.
it is difficult to choose the option that is best for you.
they will like you whether is a male or a female as long as you like them.
i am unsure what is happening and how i should proceed.
i am thirteen and i agree.
large males can offer protection, and they are excellent to cuddle with as well.
he is either homosexual or mean and either way you should end the relationship.
ask her on a date and see how it proceeds.
for example, invite yourself to her home or invite her to an upscale restaurant.
if he likes you, he is constantly looking at you.
if you like him, then yes.
i suggest that you work out all the important problems you and your wife are having besides sex.
people have this theory that men and women can never just be friends.
inside me might like you, too, but you do not know that until you talk to him.
so every time you see him, avoid him.
i see that your problem is hard.
it is nice to know what people really think.
i have farted while having sex, and it smelled.  i also banged my head against the radiator while having sex.
that is something for a doctor to talk to you about.
he is not a nice guy because nice guys do not call women names.
you can, just do not get caught.
if you are asking that means you have thought about it.
you do not become a man until you are 31.
if so, then perhaps it leads you to question your judgment in marrying a person of such toxic character.
enroll her in activities; if you pay for a gym or art class, perhaps she will meet someone.
the relationship is more than simply two people sharing an enthusiasm for sex.
why worry about his feelings for you; you left his life.
i appreciate that; it alleviates pressure from our situation.
the stuff is extremely unfavorable.
take heed not in the negative opinions regarding it as it is common. do what pleases you the most.
girls say "yes" the majority, if not all, of the time.
all of them perished during the war.
per happenstance it is merely a display of bravado.
if not, tell him to take a step back.
i think it is acceptable if he loves you as long as you are at least married.
send your id to panama city.
it becomes difficult very quickly.
i am very good at this.
very well said, tizzy. in my opinion, there is no specific time that is considered the best time to have sex.
she either likes you or does not like you.
i now realize how wrong i was, and i feel terrible for saying such a thing.
when her parents are dropping her off, they will be unable to convince her that the two of you are not compatible.
if the two of you are friends, that is wonderful.
yes, it is a bad idea.
it is an intangible feeling, nearly impossible to put into words.
have you ever thought about meeting in between for a new life?
true love is when you feel the special feeling inside when you are around him or her.
from may all the way to august.
are you asking of she will get mad if you ask her to give away her gum?
his cousin said, "i ain't gonna lie, he is, but he don't love her".
because, you have true feelings for him.
do not allow insignificant concerns to control your emotions.
move on; he does not deserve your time.
i did not think about that when i was emotionally compromised.
you also gain insight on how those in different socioeconomic situations live.
no, my cousin wore a light, faded green for her wedding; you may wear whatever you choose.
don't offer your contact information, you are more likely to receive phone call if she requests your number.
if you love them it can be overlooked, but you should explain the situation so they can understand you better.
she clearly has some things she needs to work on including rebuilding his trust after what has happened.
if the result was what you had intended, then no.
you could sprinkle rose petals in the bath and fill the bathroom with vases of roses.
if you answer that, i will date you.
if she has concerns, she can direct her question here.
it does not mean he is not afraid to do so simply because he is male.
love is too holy a feeling to be negative for anyone.
best of luck and always keep communication open with your partner.
the rate i pay for a baby-sitter is usually 25.00 english pounds.
i think the appropriate suggestion would be chocolates if he loves sweets.
it's preferable to become in that state if you like him.
you should realize your self-worth and deserve to be treated as having such.
i had a boyfriend who said he watched so he would stay faithful.
it depends on his age.
when he is a conscious and awake, listening to you, and not homosexual.
go with the one you like best because money does not matter.
even while masturbating, guy stiffen up their bodies.
have a conversation with him and ask him if he feels the same way that you do.
if you do not, you should end the relationship.
i was curious about it. i had one, however, my parents disposed of it. i am unsure what i should wear.
you have her contact information, send her an e-mail.
why do you want it that way?
whatever you like; i just want the two piece.
my advice is not to go back to him and instead find a man that you know will respect you.
once a cheater, always a cheater.
that's funny, i have to stop asking that.
with friends like that, believe me, you don't need enemies; just ignore her and get new friends.
go ahead and like someone else.
we are both friends, and i do not know if he likes me back.
i went out with this girl a few times between eight and twelveth grade in south carolina.
after she returns, are you willing to marry her?
they do hurt you know if they are big.
talk with the man rather than at him.
it is exactly the same with me.
they are unable to see what is right in front of them.
why not go bowling after dinner or the moves?
you definitely need to get out.
women love a smart man, but not one who makes them feel stupid.
some women may think so, but there are always others that do not.
i would love to hear how it goes, please email me if you want.
at that point, it becomes easy to capture a man in a long term relationship that he is locked into out of familial responsibility.
that depends on who you meet.
all the same, i hope that you are not having sex.
go to tyra banks' television show.
what questions does he have regarding your person?
please respect her wish to kiss or not.
although enjoyable, you do not get very intimate, much less marry the person.
he and i have been divorced five year and i have no desire to hear his voice.
what happened between the two of you?
i thought that it was wrong, but i would like to know what you think.
you should say no because she only wants your boyfriend and is just going to leave you after you say yes.
find out which sports or team that he likes.
they keep telling you that they would like to be more than friends, but you do not feel like dating?
i believe that being rude, obnoxious, lying and cheating can make a person ugly.
divorce may be your only option.
get a girlfriend if not.
hurt both of them, and let them go.
use your hand and you tongue.
i don't think i can trust any woman.
in all seriousness, you can simply ask him.
however, i have not found the perfect one yet.
start asking him if he still wishes to get married.
she could be interested in you too, but you just aren't aware of her feelings.
when you two married, him and his kids became your responsibility.
i do not understand why some people believe that this is such a big deal.
if could not do this together, then you should not be getting married.
i am 15 and guys say things such as, "you're hot" and "we should hook up".
think twice before you do anything.
it added insult to injury when you continued to dance with her in the club.
i frequently talk to girls that i like.
if you like him, pursue him.
she pointed a knife at you for what you did to her friend.
yes, but it is hurtful to people you are in love with if they find out.
i am not sure if i believe that.
in a few years, you will want to do one thing and he will feel it is childish.
i am seeing someone else this weekend.
i am not saying that he does not like you, however.
you should delete it and move on with your life.
you should firmly express your displeasure and terminate your association.
i believe that 17 is a very young age for entering into marriage.
you should have a serious discussion with him.
you should think about the future.
do you ever catch her gazing in your direction?
two things, number one is listen to her!
and committing adultery is nothing to brag about.
if this love is your first then you need to wait and see.
so to sum up your answer, probably yes!
have you tried looking for a gay guy?
you do not have to plead, simply send an instant message, and we will respond to you promptly.
my advice, simply do not open it, merely send it directly to the trash bin.
gather yourself and go foward.
even the type of ladies that nobody seems to favor, eventually some male will be partial towards her.
or, at the next dance, invite him to dance.
try inviting him over to your house, and then do a few different things you enjoy.
i infer you have not been setting frequent romantic social engagements of late?
be yourself; do not pretend to have a personality you may think suits the moment for some other reason.
that is all well and good, but i hope i may offer you some helpful counsel.
please keep in mind that i am thirteen years old, and quite flirtatious.
i need advice on how to make a man with a good personality attracted to me.
does he improve his vocabulary, give you attention, and act mature?
again, i don't mention anything about my fee.
however, it could be safe.
when in the situation, i appreciate it when she asks, and hug her and say nothing; it is effective.
i can't seem to get it all together.
i think that just means that she likes you.
how did you guys find your man?
from the court or ask your father. he gives you a right answer.
so why should they deserve you?
not that me may be small.
if he doesn't like it, then at least you tried.
aside from yanking the wanky, it is called divorce!
just satisfy him by having sex with him.
please do not go looking for a boy friend to avoid being alone.
this being your first date, it should not be your choice.
hello. he is trying to kill you. so dump him. he is either mentally ill or is a very nasty person.
the ups guys is much better than anyone.
hurt them before something happens.
if you do it too much, it will affect your sexual life.
as long as you remain calm.
tell him that he needs to change or that you are not meant to be together.
no, there is nothing wrong with that.
buy him some cd's that he has been wanting.
now that i have grown up, they relate to me a bit differently, but they continue to worry.
he is interested in only one thing, your genitals.
it may happen of its own accord, but why wait passively for that?
do not be fake or posture as if you do not care.
what do i think about racists; well, i can't say here, it's not polite.
to begin with dave, i want to say that young women do like caring young men.
nothing is stopping you; go for it; i never thought of having sex in public.
tell her if you want a divorce.
i know that it appears to be humorous, "target!"
he will not obtain that promotion to be able to purchase you items later.
it is a travesty when something as such occurs, but, unfortunately, it seems to always occur at one point in one's life.
not a romantic encounter, please, something other than that.
so, in response to your question, yes, i believe it does pertain to a certain extent.
tell him you cannot be with him if he is married.
are you truly of lesser height than he is?
to begin with, forgive yourself, and then do not repeat your mistake.
go out and meet new people, and do not be afraid to have standards.
my brother appreciates people like you.
if he is just a friend then listen to him and hold on to him.
when you find a good man, marry him.
i am not sure if she likes him.
we can be friends if you prefer.
don't waste your time with her if she doesn't love you.
i have been married for one score.
it's dependent on what you know about him.
he will avoid crossing the line if he cares about you.
just think about what i told you, first.
he makes me so happy and i feel wanted for once.
but, you have to find it. do not wait for it.
why did you not tell me first?
if he is mean, then she should not have been dating him that long in the first place.
men aren't nearly as perverted as women.
we can fool around if you want.
are you flirting because you want to be with him or are you just teasing him?
i need to go and search for that on ask jeeves.
simply inform him that it will not function.
yes, it does, you do not want your male paramour to have odor or suffer from erectile dysfunction.
do not run, force others to run.
if it is the same male.
simply ponder of attending by yourself or, hilariously, with your cousin.
i do not understand why some women feel the need to enlarge their breasts.
fool me twice, shame on me.
you should definitely pick her up, it makes you look better.
would you do him if he's black, thinking you are going to get a big one?
it will set you up for an array of problems.
first don't do it if you haven't done it yet.
he even seemed heart broken when i let him go.
just have fun and play it smart.
you get the car ride over to chat!
yes, but let's take stock of the situation; it may be something i am doing.
would you not prefer to find her attractive and get along with her well, before proceeding?
additionally, the first man handled it correctly.
if it bothers you, ask him about it.
at a strip club, they will even be naked.
a guy that has to impress you with how loud their car gets is not ideal.
let's help her find a man to be with.
he is not treating his wife very well if he is always thinking of you.
you don't want an inbox filled with spam.
hello, i would find new friends, can you speak for me?
if she is taken, however, she still cares what the best way to walk away is.
her answer said it all.
people want you to buy their merchandise. put it in spam if you do not want it to go into your inbox.
i am right now. hump, hump.
i am in the same situation and it is very frustrating.
speak as if you were speaking to anyone.
she will come back.
there is no pressure to kiss each other goodnight.
yes, please do not embarrass us or argue.
age is only a number.
not always, it depends on both people.
what will i be doing and where will i be next year at this time?
you will feel less lonely if you make some male friends.
i did not dislike it, not even for one minute.
i disagree, many of them desire the companionship as well.
remove yourself from this relationship and proximity to this man quickly.
some people will agree and some will disagree.
did you kiss them?
in my opinion, size is important.
i believe people fall in love with the idea of their mate, but not the reality of their mate.
i'm searching for a new companion.
if you do not really love her, please just leave her alone.
please scroll down until you see messenger or yahoo.
he does not love you at all, he would just like to take advantage of you.
he has begun to slow down on partying and drinking, however, he is still scared to get married.
i do not have a girlfriend yet.
think about what makes you truly happy.
i just wanted to see if i had made the right decision.
i don't agree with what you are thinking about.
i believe that you two should become more acquainted; rushing into a sexual relationship may be harmful to the relationship.
being kind to everyone you meet will ultimately help you gain friends.
if my girl was dating another girl, i would certainly end the relationship because of her lack of faithfulness and loyalty.
whatever you do, do not judge people by what you see in movies.
be careful, but tell him that you like him.
every date does not have to be super special, but the first date should be.
use a slow glide out of the mouth.
would guys think you are flirting with them even in a normal conversation?
consider the consequences in the future.
be sure to give time to ponder this.
go by yourself to counseling if he will not attend with you.
i only ever show that side of myself when my boyfriend speaks sexually to me.
i believe that it means that she likes you.
when he asks you out again, tell him that you are going to think about it.
i am not a male, but my boyfriend and i often talk about the male mind.
so, the idea of a potential new love really frightens me.
"qrs, tuv, wx, y and z"; choose any word that comes to mind first starting with the letters 'a', and then 'b'.
they look sexy on thin or moderate women and girls but do not on overweight ones.
if he wants to suck your blood?
but people like this do exist.
go to her, talk with her, make her a friend, then tell when she is in a happy mood.
it is as going to the shoe store, picking out a fine pair of shoes and taking them home.
i am trying to say someone who skates.
yes, you want one but are you ready for one?
it is because some girls are more intelligent than other girls.
maybe because this young man said that to me and was really nice to me the next day?
stop trying to ruin other's lives.
you might even ask her out then.
believe yourself and try to be your best.
you cannot solve someone else's problem.
if he knows how to put them to work.
we have dinner, watch movies and hang out on holidays as good friends should do.
greyhound does a good job at transporting people to different places.
or ask yourself if he is still the person you fell in love with.
you need to learn what the girl prefers.
just approach him and strike up a conversation.
would you do that guy just because he is big?
think about them, but do not obsess.
hope you get the answer you want.
you are not serious and you are still with him?
i believer no, because he is probably not over he.
most men will have to urinate while having and erection.
no phone calls during his vacation, even on new years eve?
people will try to entice you to buy worthless things.
if she were serious about pursuing you, she would get a divorce and begin again.
because if they did not, then you would not be here to ask your wonderful question.
after i got married, 6 months ago.
he will hurt you in the future, if not now.
they do not want to be with each other.
walk away and don't allow it to happen.
ask her if you're too embarrass.
do it if you are acquainted with her.
everything will be fine if she doesn't have any skeletons in her closet.
does it have to do with the men i attract?
as both her and her sister out on a date.
i love my boyfriend, but i like them both.
let this difficult time disappear into the past.
you are a child.
sometimes men give me their phone numbers. it is usually just because i am not dressed in a non-form fitting shirt.
how do you stop a man from cheating on his partner?
flirt with him and see what happens.
firstly, i think this is very cute, secondly, i am a girl.
she is very angry at me and said that she will not forgive me.
do not do this again.
you should be worrying about things like coloring books, big bird, and barney.
if you read some of the conservative opinions others have written here, you would not believe it.
i like a girl very much.
someone named "nobody" was rude to you on yahoo answers?
you should run away from that crazy person.
tell them how you feel because it might be mutual.
that indicates that you love him and want to be with him for the rest of your life.
i don't know what to say if that is the case.
the women are beautiful and can be trusted.
it's obvious that she wants to steal your boyfriend from you.
thirty-five is still fairly young and i don't think you should have a problem with leaving.
you need to question your love for her.
you have to show him what he will lose if he leaves you.
i charge five dollars an hour on a per kid basis.
yes, it damages our reputation.
i love her, will someone please help?
do not force her into anything.
i mind dancing with girls that are taller than me, not shorter.
when in a relationship, so long as you both agree on this, you both need to trust one another.
up tho this point, he has not showed to care you much.
what is it you must do?
this is inexcusable.
she and i reconnected sexually two weeks down the road.
that means that she if not a very straight forward person.
it would be a lot more romantic if you picked her up.
perhaps you should ask one of her close friends.
actions speak louder than words.
i do not see anything to woryy about.
or a guy already in my car.
i am not muslim, but have had muslim girls all my life until today.
kids put a lot on having a boyfriend or girlfriend.
call her and tell her what happened, or tell your man.
you take away a guys self worth if you do that.
now, you need to get yourself married and make him your best friend.
that just crosses the line. my other friend said so. so he's still breathing?
you need to make a decision. and if he really cares about you, he should to!
if you are both old enough and mature enough, than i say, why not?
actually, if any woman teases you about a kiss. i mean, if she plays games with you, then drop her also.
i don't believe it is true with all people.
she ended our relationship and then tried to renew it an hour or two later.
some people say i can't wait for the first night: my wedding night.
take her hand in yours and have her teach you what she likes.
just confidently walk up to her, be yourself, and i'm sure it will work.
i have yet to receive her phone number at this time.
she is stalking me and attempting to associate with my friends, including those whose company she does not enjoy.
you should expect the best of yourself.
it sounds as though you are a good friend for her.
if you do not connect on this level, it is unlikely you can sustain a long-term relationship.
you should make the first move, especially if he does not know you.
it is not right to force someone to do something they are not comfortable with.
you have to ready for the answer.
i have taken care of many sick men and women.
i am really just looking for an opinion.
i rarely see him during school, either; rather, i normally see him at my brother's basketball games.
if it is your first kiss, it is likely to be awkward.
at any rate, it is likely he will break up with you if you do consummate your relationship.
many modern brides walk themselves down the aisle, and in fact i have even seen a bride walked down the aisle by her mother.
certainly not, particularly if he questions you about your life prior to meeting him or her.
this is not the time nor the place.
i am unable to admit that i have not used it.
did he confess it to you?
you should start talking at first, then smile in a cute manner while refraining from having a seductive nature.
"hard core" means a rough, "bad-boy" nature, while "soft core" means sweet and caring.
i'm unsure if i am one.
at this point in time, you are only 17. things do change...
i detest that statement, it was very rude!
at what age did you obtain your first kiss? give some details.
it would appear to be pointless as the truth will always come out.
it seems a little bit ridiculous.
i think you should keep it a secret.
do you have a sister?
i do not have knowledge because i have done anything of the sort.
it will not be a problem as long as there is strong communication.
if you love her you should talk to her.
i told her after our second date.
either he will tell you or he will act in a different, positive manner.
some people are bad and some people are good.
it seems like there is a lack of trust
it is a more enjoyable experience in this way.
which pet peeve is greatest on your list?
and as such: my breasts, my back, legs, butt, p****, c***, etc...
at that point, i move my hands downward and pull her against me, showing that...
simply go up and talk to her while smiling and just being yourself.
i doubt you would endure that for an entire week.
very well, but how much money is "a lot" from your point of view?
i am quite serious; make him breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
perhaps that is why she wanted some time apart.
i know this is easier said than done, but it is important to give it your best- good luck.
people will be happy if they got what they wanted.
she would not do it for her two kids.
make sure you read to her.
you should tell her how you feel.
when i gave birth to my child, i urinated.
ask him if he has an instant messenger.
yes, you are very attractive; please return my e-mail at your earliest convenience.
many of us are single.
i do not want a relationship, simpy a noncommital relationship with someone whose company i enjoy.
life should be enjoyed in your youth.
there must be a reason that your question was asked.
despite everything, i am still happily married.
flirting helps reveal the true feelings of your love interest.
it's not often that i hear a woman getting something.
they say kids are resilient and adjust, but that is not true.
casually ask them to go and get a drink.
i agree with the group, you should take your time and not rush into kissing her.
instead of inviting the person you're interested in, invite a group.
try to be relaxed and casual.
you smile and think about them frequently.
they say that we as women are the weaker sex.
i predict that you two will soon be together.
size does not matter; how you use it is what matters.
i do not love animals. i do not own any and i have no desire to do so.
he will get angry if i mention i have a guy friend.
apologies, but i cannot understand what you are saying. can you be more specific?
she will eventually give it back, but only after i nag her.
plain and simple, move on cheavaen d from columbus, ohio.
she's in her late fifty's and they are still in love.
call up one friend, and then go out with the other.
to me, love is a four letter word with no meaning.
it is what you make of it.
is it johnny depp or howard stern?
do you know her and have you spoken to her before?
i would break up with him if he continues to ask.
lust can lead to love, but it is not required.
that is how she will know what is expected of her from you.
what do people mean when they say she isn't girlfriend material?
yes, one of must be gay.
yes her ankle's are just fine now.
everyone has feelings, even a 1 year old has feelings already.
that is similar to stating why we cannot walk around nude.
what manner of girl? homosexual girl or genuine girl?
fine, when will i obtain a female paramour?
the lady asked you to be her male paramour and to always be with me.
simply inform him that you favor him and present him something you believe he will enjoy.
it depends, some like when they are large, others like smaller ones, but it really shouldn't matter.
60 miles isn't that far away, you can take a bus.
relax for a moment, and read you email.
things have been going swell until recently.
a lot of men do it.
i do not. does he make you laugh?
i can honestly say that at one time in my life i dated minnie mouse.
try it, you will get a response.
they seem pretty easy to read to me.
who knows if you are beginning to favor her?
it is not the males, it is the females.
i am sorry, i cannot, but if i try hard enough, perhaps you will discover one such as myself.
if you are certain you love him.
but, that is not love when you are unfaithful.
i thing perhaps it is time for you to move on and stop being a doormat.
it is ok with me if they felt confused or curious and decided to explore a gay relationship.
i really do not know as it is not a problem or situation i've ever had or want to be in.
what is in it for a guy if he gets it already without being married?
whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.
move on from him and obtain a more deserving man.
however, i do not know how to tell her that i like her.
you are a good daughter, and you deserve a hug.
however, i married her because of who she is and how she was.
i accept the pay they provide.
superficially, it is unethical to have any intimate relationship with any married persons at all.
as i am a girl, i will tell you straightforwardly.
well, for one thing, i would be very angry.
alternatively, we could just be friends.
am i to understand that relationships begun online in fact proceed to marriage?
at thirteen years old, i may lack the necessary perspective to inform my commentary.
additionally, it helps if you reside in a metropolitan area with a sizable population of gay men.
i recommend buying him clothes or cologne.
if you were in front of me, i would know.
i believe that you should. one con is the racist jokes, but the pro is experiencing something new.
then talk to him through that avenue.
i believe that you should wait for her to do something.
okay. are you saying that you want to have two wives?
there is a lot of life left for me to live.
i am from new york and not from some other planet.
you can't control who catches your eye.
i hope you do well.
do you think your sex life could be better?
of course, because i should know; it is hard to choose which one i really like, but it is possible.
what kind of person would do that?
alone and miserable- that way, you don't have to put up with anyone else's poor behavior or boundaries.
how are you sure he won't cheat?
it is absolutely wrong if he is married, he probably never liked you.
men want women to look good, be smart, and jut be confident.
i look back at past boyfriends, and i don't know why i dated them.
i admit i am an overachiever sometimes, but i am still a good time.
when i am comfortable around a girl and i can be myself, it feels like everyday is a holiday.
it finally came down to who was bigger.
i hope this helped.
just be yourself and it will all work out
i have no idea what to do with the bed sheet.
i found the statement " because it works" to be quite humorous.
not if i had any self- respect.
there is someone for you as well, just be patient.
women with their sense of style and a healthy sense of humor can be very attractive.
tell her that she is your one and only love and things should progress nicely.
having a big nose does not make a person ugly.
you never know what will happen until you try.
it is totally normal for guys and is nothing to worry about.
we have a nineteen year old son.
i really want him back although all my friends say no.
if i call her, she is always willing to meet up and allow me to sleep in the same bed.
the problem with men is that you start too soon.
she is intersted in marriage, how do you feel?
unfortunately, that is not a possibility for me. i am usure, i apologize.
if you are in debt or have bad credit, this is some information that you should share.
going out is benefical from time to time.
no, not if you are truly interested in enjoying it.
it's as complicated as you make it out to be.
yes, many of them. likely more than you are aware.
when you find him, ask if he has a brother. i would like to find love as well.
she is usually the one that tries to get me into bed.
that's a predicament. i know that i may not be much help.
i know it is bad, but i am really trying to be better.
just we were not compatible, does not mean him and his wife won't be compatible.
please use better english.
he does not deserve to be pitied, rather, be glad he has moved on with his life.
you need a family that does not engage in raping and prostitution.
it delivers pleasure all while the world would ending.
teenagers are still children at times. even at age 21, it would be pushing it.
of course. i will return communication if you send me an email.
consider your known strengths, your self, and your desires.
in my personal experiences, it is best if you know a dirty police officer or shady governmental employee.
keep loving this one. love conquers all!
the size will do all the work. otherwise it is all about the skills. guys need to learn that.
tell jokes and laugh at what they are saying only if it is actually funny.
i do not think i have a chance so could you please help?
my sister had one and the guy turned out to be bad, very bad.
yes, it is okay to date the guy.
anyway, he says that men just think about sex.
xbox all the way or of course his pl!
my boy friend's foot size is 14. you are 13?
it's possible that you could be meeting the wrong people.
fragment /does not make sense.
it's dependent on where you will pick him up.
she went to a school in south carolina and i went to a school in georgia.
if you give me your email address, i will email you.
i find the man attractive.
love is simply an emotion that sometimes hurts, and sometimes makes you happy.
relax, my friend; if she actually loves you, as it seems you love her, just wait and let her get back to you.
stop pursuing so strongly; love finds you when you least expect it.
that should increase your confidence.
too large is strange, but it is also strange if they are too small, because you cannot feel anything.
the first priority is to distinguish one from the other.
i want to know... goodness, listen to the song.
that would be beautiful.
did it end well, or did it end with pain and problems?
listen, trust, and love him.
if a girl cannot accept you for who you are, then that is her problem.
i believe that soul mates are destiny.
try to reach him to see what is going on.
there is nothing sexier than confidence!
come talk to me, my name is my yahoo i.d.
eventually he will get answers from other sources and will not like you anymore.
do not feel bad, it is not a good reason.
at age 9, what's the point of having a boyfriend?
reap the benefits is my advice.
ask him if he enjoys eye contact.
as time progresses in a marriage, then it soon disappears.
you are thinking too deeply about this.
you will likely be cheated on by him in the future if he was able to cheat on his wife.
he lives in canada while i'm residing in california.
i appreciate responses to this and thank you.
no longer is she only a bitch, she's now a cunt.
i it truly love, or just lust?
in that case, leave; stay mysterious in that way.
tell him the same thing you told us, and then do not put a great emotional responsibility on him.
a mate needs to bring happiness into your life, not drama.
that is why whenever someone asks about my income and so forth...
now he does not return my calls, my emails, and is otherwise unresponsive.
did you enjoy your relationship when you were a homosexual?
i recommend yahoo 360; you can join some groups.
perhaps you could ask her to start over and go on another date.
she is the love of my life.
you smile and you get it overwith.
this girl comes to my gym.
that girl who told your exgirlfriend is insane.
do not ask anyone, just look deeply into her eyes and you will know it.
just say it, do not be misleading or anything, just let it out.
you can find that anywhere.
knowing what you know will help to be in the best frame of mind.
the faster you start a new, loving relationship, the happier you will be.
just tell her it. it is what i would do.
they like to be treated just like a baby.
and, oh, us women love that.
who do you think is the beast?
that is the same problem i have.
i believe it's indicative of having a sweet side.
it appears to be what most girls would do if they hold a grudge against someone else.
he states he wants me back, and i feel i am still in love with him.
i was advised by his friends that he likes me.
not every guy is stupid, but your boyfriend might be.
when i got him back i realized he was just an unintelligent person with a picture of my breasts.
and that is what it sounds like.
we are good friends now.
there is an old saying that is: fool me once, shame on you.
try to flirt with her and move on.
i understand how you feel because that happened to me about one month ago.
do not call her house anymore.
we graduated and i moved to texas for the summer.
i am a brunette and i certainly have plenty of fun.
i agree with her.
i am in possession of one in my freezer, however it doesn't contain a phone number or web-site.
to what extent does love, itself, have meaning in relation to it?
this is the answer and his question?
i'm an on the fence of whether to do it or not. i am inspired by them in my choice making.
attempt to calm her down.
you and your boyfriend should not act upon it.
if a guy likes you, then he will try to spend a large portion of his time with you.
i was always interested in the boys considered to be "bad".
i have a number of good qualities such as being clean and in shape, but unfortunately they are not being utilized.
if she doesn't, then you will have to let her go.
i have done that twice, and i do not regret it.
no, i just made eye contact and gave her a gentle hug; then she understood what i meant.
isn't it cute that he leaves his socks all over the floor?
if you already declined, and he keeps pursuing it, that is probably his only concern.
still, it is nice to spread it around.
then you can ask them how their day is going.
you should walk her down the aisle.
if you don't think those things about yourself, no one else will.
the incident-rate of marrying a virgin is quite low.
my initial reaction is of shock, however, i would defer to your judgement.
if that truly is your soulmate, then i concur with your judgement.
perhaps a reality check is in order to see if both mother and father would agree to your statement.
was it said by him that he is interested in you or showing 'likeliness' to befriend you?
he loves both me and my children.
i firmly believe that god has a sense of humor.
you should never need to be someone's second choice.
you need to have a boyfriend.
he will be a peter puffer for as long as he lives.
i agree with cracacola 85
if he avoids answering the question, then tell him that is unacceptable.
tell me what you're thinking.
you are not far away from your love!
that depends on the individual, but yes.
people will do stupid things for love.
well, some people are just not open minded, i guess.
if you are a shy one and able to start a conversation.
i also talk to her mom.
they are always on your mind.
wait until the next dance, then go ahead and ask him.
dearest, he is unfaithful to another with you, he will be unfaithful to you.
wait another year so that you gentlemen will not befall into trouble.
men are dishonest about issues that do not truly matter?
simply make certain to gently grasp the scrotum.
and, perhaps blame what you stated to him previously on your state of intoxication.
since men have greater amounts of the sex hormone testosterone, they prefer more physical contact.
perhaps he would request a dinner date or something similar.
simply try to remain respectful with the child's mother unless she behave disrespectfully.
that is when you need to end it.
it depends on what kind of woman you prefer.
but, make sure it is love and not lust.
you have to be somwhere.
has he been acting any different sexually?
she might not know if she is actually in love, but she will know in the end of the relationship.
if i do not call, she will never call me.
does she still enjoy your company?
when this happens, you should discontinue your relationship, because past indiscretions predict future indiscretions.
finding a girl to talk to on yahoo is like pulling teeth, my friend.
tell him hello the next time you pass him in the hallway!
consider just saying "goodbye" or "good luck", then turning around and walking away.
if you fooled me twice, then shame on me.
sometimes you don't think of them at all; it still won't make you forget.
race is not an issue if you truly love someone.
you're able to find closure easily, and also find new partner.
it appears unlikely that you will find one.
is this not unlike the giant q-tips the 'gladiators' use(d)?
if that's what you have, then hold off until the right time.
you should stop having sexual intercourse with the wives of your friends.
he is 90% sure that he likes you and he wants to tell you.
otherwise, i do not see what is wrong with 4 1/2 feet.
how did you feel when your relationship ended?
will i have a high income?
also, do not have sex until you marry a man.
all he can say is yes or no.
why do you not ask a hippo?
good luck, and persevere.
don't feel awkward, i am 15 years old.
share some of his hobbies, like sports, food, etc.
bringing someone emotional pain is an awful thing to do.
we had a falling out, and it pains me that we can't be together anymore.
there is only one way to deal with your desires, avoid temptation at all costs.
yes, i know many children like this; does anyone else see my point?
what are you teaching your children?
i have liked this woman since ninth grade.
as the old adage says, it is better to be safe then to be sorry.
please explain why or why not.
he still does this even after thirteen years of marriage and two children together.
some guys date like they were shopping for a car.
please leave the twinkies alone.
when you have the chance, and when you are ready, you should ask her on a date.
yes, there are three people, but just be yourself.
thigh highs for more reasons than can be thought of
boys are boys, they are like that
if you are having trouble coming up with things to day, just ask, "how are you?"
please do not feel sorry for me, i have another one already in my route.
i advise you to leave the relationship- for your own best interests, for his children, and for your child.
what do boys do when they have intimate relations?
that is acceptable, if sex is your only interest; it is unacceptable if you are interested in more than sex.
just continue reading and you will find something eventually.
smile, you will be okay.
if not, then i believe you have your answer.
i once dated someone who did not have any size at all. up until then, i had thought that size mattered.
then maybe you will be able to talk to him easily when you see him again.
i am attracted to large noses.
physical appearance is not that important but their outlook on life and the future are.
i am more attracted to the thigh lenght ones.
the only way to know is to ask her.
you will enjoy studying.
love is trust, and without it, many unhappy things will happen, so you should keep in contact and tell him that you trust him face-to-face.
if you did, you would not ask this question, nor would you care what anyone thinks.
the following situations are possible: he is insecure; you are cold; or both of you perceive the other this way.
and yes, men think they are very sexy.
then one girl said that one guy had a 9 inch and was bigger than the other.
normal men rarely approach and take a chance with a girl unless they are instinctively safe.
in other words, be quiet and do not talk about it.
if you like her too, then you should be happy that she calls you honey.
losing your self-respect or self esteem can have lasting effects.
unfortunately, our relationship was not meant to be.
i am definitely in love!
i am attractive but i fail at the fine art of flirtation.
we argued about issues that were important and ones that seemed trivial.
that is disgusting and unpleasant.
i do not understand your question was.
people are rude and i do not understand you.
i think i love a girl but i do not know what love is.
revenge will not work, but ignoring him will work.
my guess is that indeed he does; how long have you two been a couple?
males always have had the burden of inviting females out.
well, hiding something does not clarify it as being unfaithful.
you will never know, people could change, you understand?
it is not that they cannot, merely that they choose not to.
if you have to ask, then you must be small!
you should give him a call to chat.
conversely, i have come a lot of my own kind that do not.
you should talk to him and smile all the time when you meet, good luck.
if a guy really likes you, he should ask you out.
you do not need advice; you need to end the relationship.
i am not looking for a love interest, but rather a woman to become friends with and perhaps other things.
it depends on what man he is.
people always reach a point where they think they will be getting married and then have sex.
she could be upset because you are in a relationship with him and she does not want to share her children.
she is pretty and popular and i am not very popular.
you can definitely do the walking at her request.
i do not know how to find a good man.
i would like to marry a blonde with blue eyes, and have blonde, blue eyed children.
my daughter is 16, and her fiancee is 18.
do not stay wrapped up in turbulent, negative emotions, and remember that the end is only the beginning.
you do not have to do anything.
yes, it means he loves you, but not in a perverted way; rather in an endearing way.
because you don't if you found it and you can't define it.
we will have to watch the show "cheaters" for that episode; it's going to be a good one.
talk to your psychologist: how can you trust someone when they believe you are mad?
i remember answering this already.
i am divorced (picked the wrong man; isn't that difficult to believe?)
i have stayed true to i am and i've got three guys who are fighting over me.
will he be able to help support your family?
she visited me before we both went to school.
do not cheat or aid somebody in there efforts to cheat because there will be negative consequences.
sixteen is too young to be thinking about getting married.
do your best to impress her parents so they know that you are right for their daughter.
it costs a lot of money to take care of kids.
"smart love" by dr. phil is a good read. the library loans it for free.
he came out and said it.
i am unsure as to what needs to be done.
be yourself and do not try to be someone else. everything will work out for you.
if you do well in college.
no, i practice abstinence.
i do hope that my information was able to help you.
dishonesty, which leads to infidelity and more along those lines.
if you have any questions or need any advice, ask me and i will tell you your future!
i believe that i have more fulfilling relationships with others who are similar to me.
as a man, i would not know.
it will improve as time passes.
be nice and polite when you ask him out.
go have fun.
tell her you do not want to marry this man, and stop calling him.
my girlfriend met her husband at a biker party.
i want a girl who loves me as much as i love her.
i would advise you to just be yourself.
if you care for me, then it would be an advantage knowing that you do not care what other people think.
i would not date either an unattractive or attractive man.
i must answer this question!
it is a definite advantage not to have a criminal record.
that is what having children can do.
she proposed to me in the twelfth grade and i accepted.
it is best to practice sincerity and patience when in a relationship.
isn't it the other way around?
it seems as if there is something between us, yet he is hesitant to act on it.
i do; it is something that most men can not do without.
especially the ones that are sold at hot topic.
however, you know that women say that "all the good men are either taken or gay".
either way is a sign that he could be interested.
tell her that you find her pretty without being perverted about it.
you don't get scared easily.
thank you for being interested in heavier set women.
i reccommend making him meals that he enjoys.
ask her where she is and show up!
men and women can both be rude.
if you got it, flaunt it, but have the personality to back it up.
there are plenty of fish in the sea.
first, make small talk and smile a lot.
what matters is how you use it; size is just a bonus.
wait to give love taps until you are comfortable with one another.
if he is good looking, then what is the difference if he has hearing aids?
i am 14. it happened to me. it could happen to you.
you need to leave her alone. trust me. you are 14!
not know how and when i am going to die.
when you know, you truly know.
you should do what you want to do.
yes, you will, so do not worry; you are too young right now at any rate.
goodness gracious, you cannot do that with children.
since you have already decided in your heart that he is unfaithful, why bother attempting to uncover a transgression in real life?
if you follow my counsel, if she is well adjusted, you will not need it.
you are thinking of someone who is confused, not mysterious; it is from trying to understand a woman.
best of luck; you have chosen a difficult path.
if that is so, why did you marry him?
i would suggest waiting, but if you love him then you should do it.
you're digusting, that is not the way of the lord.
to me, losing your virginity seems like a big disappointment.
i believe that if you tell them that you may mess up the friendship; however, if you do not it also might.
ask yourself, "am i still the same woman that my husband married?".
perhaps they were brought up to not speak while their mouths are full.
you would use your mouth to speak.
does not put down my friends, parents or siblings.
i would not be too concerned about it.
past indiscretions predict future indiscretions.
as with all siblings, some teasing is certain to occur.
why does he want you back?
start with the book "smart love" by dr. phil.
you should show some pride.
attempting to disrupt a marriage is not desirable.
ask your parents; they will show you an example.
i would never do that because it is wrong. some guys will, depending upon the individual.
in order to fix things, it's a matter of making the move.
i also hear similar things from him.
i would surmise it to say that you wear hearing aids. i would bet you have much beauty and that those things matter.
you are out of my age-range, but good luck in finding someone.
does anyone have any recommendations for a website i can go to for something extra special?
i am not a model.
if you don't see his reflection, then you should run.
if he truly cares about you, your height would not matter to him.
we are friends, though i am interested in possibly dating.
if she is not interested, it may be best to seek other options.
you should prioritize a college education to ensure earning potential.
the situation may have escalated to a problem.
it may be wise to have more concern for your present company than your surroundings.
because if you really loved him then you should be happy to be with him no matter what happens.
my family, they are the love of my life. so, my love story revolves around them.
it also depends if he is really cute.
i have one right now and it is taking me forever to get rid of it.
here is a though. let us both tell them and see what happens.
i do have nothing against the guy, however.
do not pretend to be someone else.
he likes or cares to see.
first of all, why aren't you sexually active with him/her?
for extra support, take a close friend with you, if needed.
these two people must have had bad relationships with you?
it is not a good idea. please don't do that.
you may need to be worried if he is defensive.
put on your makeup, dress, and your high heel shoes and go enjoy yourself.
maybe it's just for this large lipped lady.
i hope i find a boyfriend this year.
let them know what happns.
why are you asking me that?
don't date only because that is for nerds.
give her space and she will come back to you when she is ready.
yes, i go in christian chat rooms, but regardless of the type of chat room, you still need to be careful.
it has frequently been unbearable without him.
it varies from place to place.
you should go out and enjoy yourself.
remember, if she comes, the winner is not you, but rather both of you.
if there is a man that you like, you should date him.
perhaps you have not had sex in some time; perhaps you have arousing dreams, or you are just weird.
yes, i really am the most attractive male in the world!
also, you do not need to rely on the man; second, they say that "love conquers all".
it is one of the better things to do.
do you really want a girl who only wants you for sex?
it is time to get over him and find someone new.
i am very hurt and confused by this.
they are not fluent in english
let's go fishing.
that's not they told me last time.
you are the one who seemed hesitant about being with him, in that case.
it should belong to both of you.
do not attempt to mention your talents, abilities, sacrifice, etc.
her name is jeanne owens, thank you.
if you are not that type of person, do not attempt it, as it will not be beneficial.
does he only come out at night?
would you like to know that your wife is in love with someone else?  i am sure you would not appreciate that.
paranoia is when you think you are the only sane person in the world (which, in fact, i am).
keep in mind, men are very easily intimidated.
it can sometimes be, in fact, some very small occasions.
you must have a strong friendship if she is comfortable asking you this.
it is possible your boyfriend is one of them, but it does not sound like it.
you should definitely dump that jerk.
secret or not, you have you say something. it is never too soon to be in love!
what do you think about the theory that alligators are survivors of the dinosaur age?
if you offered to let me date johnny depp, i would be happy.
love is not hard to find; you are just looking too hard.
i don't know if this man is attracted to me.
this describes my youngest uncle.
yes, i am 16 years old and catholic.
we will lead it the way we want to lead it.
find out why your mother does not like her and fix it so she likes her.
he just needs to reevaluate the situation from a new perspective.
begin by visiting place that you enjoy.
be with someone you deserve.
if he is as nice as you say he is, then you have nothing to worry about.
never go to bangkok in september.
i proposed to my wife after only three days.
if she does not care about what you have to say, then leave her alone.
you have not done anything wrong.
she is already married to jesse james (monster garage).
there is no circumstance in which it is acceptable to get involved with a married man.
it depends on what type of men you prefer.
it only becomes a sin when you ridicule it.
it makes you sound somewhat coarse.
usually i am willing to try new things, but not four and a half feet, especially when i am much taller than that.
if she will not forgive him, then they will break up.
people who are not polite are not worth pursuing.
the finger next to the little finger.
you could try putt putt, do something fun and inexpensive.
that is just not what we do.
if you have answered that question, then you probably already knew what to do from the beginning.
does he not want to marry me after all?

if he has moved on to/with a new girlfriend, then you shouldn't still hold feelings for him in such a way any longer.
the amount of pain i received from her is great. is it correct in giving her another chance?
after hearing the details, i would be suspicious as well.

if it is a serious relationship, age eighteen.
first flirt with him, then, watch his response, and finally, you can make out.
he is a real jerk to ask you something like that.
if you like her you should ask her out on a date.
not all guys behave like animals.
experience life and make new friends.
why do you still speak to her?
i like having sex
also if you consider when my mom was still calling me her baby when i was sixteen years old.
if all he cares about is sex, and not you, then you shouldn't be with him.
should i make my voice louder so that he will no longer need to use his hearing aids?
it is up to you how you feel about others.
thank you, i really needed that.
this guy wanting to be friends with you, appears to me, to be dangerous in and of itself.
typically, a larger man equates to being a big baby.

of the choices, which would you choose? give detail.
ensure enough time and effort to bring it to light properly.

when was the last time that he told you he loved you?
he doesn't understand how it works.
that guy is terrible.
every lead that i have pursued was a dead end.
honestly, he probably will not.
i am not in florida, but i still need friends.
many men who do this know that they do not, they simply to not inform the female participant.

hope she understands as well. good luck with that.
my guess would be too slutty or lot of work.

i still feel i am in love with him
how could you put your relationship with your best friend at risk?
i keep seeing flashbacks of how hurt she looked, on a regular basis in my mind.

it could be that you just want to leave the relationship.
there are many people who believe in those things.
how do you overcome that all of your friends are in a relationship, and you are not?
as such, be young and enjoy yourself.

the both knew it would have an ill effect on you.
it is all about your start; until you meet him and become one.
concentrate on what you have going for you right now, and what interests you.
did you try to talk to him?

you either love him or you do not.
go find a male in reality.
supppose those are not great places to search for a gentleman.
not until at least the third date.
find him and have intercourse with him as passionately as you can.
it seems that way, based on how many people are asking about that.
do not spend your time on him.
what is enjoyable to you may not be enjoyable to another person.
given that you feel right together, and that you are content regardless.
he is too cautious in his outings.
it seems as if there are a few issues here.
i would like to kiss him, but am concerned about what others would say.

wait and see what he does. i think he is either shy or ashamed of himself.
i am comfortable with myself even when i am lonely or depressed.
i, too, found your story painful to read. i feel sorry for you.
you should look for a woman who likes you.
it shows you're more mature to walk away.
yes, but you should take it slow and make that person feel special.
begin speaking about a funny or unusual topic.
if you casually chat, have no emotional connections, and do not participate in online sex, then i would say no.
though, then again, i may not be looking very hard.
i do not really think it is the ring that matters.
size matters but for what effect?
if he still adores you even though you have told him you are not interested, maybe there is something there?
my friend introduced us to each other and i trusted he would be a great guy.
i do not know.  if you hear anything, please let me know.

you should get his number and call him.
i have friends of all ages.
i would prefer not to marry him.
you will have a man that has your personality.
if she really hates you that much for no reason, then she is psycho, and you should just avoid her.
if the guy is just a friend, then i do not see a problem with it.
that is the way it is boys, thank your hormones.

should i have sex at the age of 13?
do not let him see the things (love, affection, care, etc.) that you should give to someone else's arms.

men have orgasms faster than women, so it's important for me to satisfy my lover first.

i have always felt pity for the girl because i had just eaten lasagna.

he will enjoy them is he likes football, and all men love watches.

this happened to a friend of mine.
did you tell the people who you most care about that you love them?
my final answer is, for who they are.
the point is you are not comfortable and it makes a difference.
okay that was feeble.
in the event that he wants an intimate dinner with family and close friends,
i appreciate the style of spanish boys and always find them fun to spend time with.
it will hurt regardless of what you use.
although we are friends, we did not connect.
that is difficult to conceal from close friends.
if you feel like that again, tell her you are no longer comfortable dating.
although you may move on, you never forget someone you loved.
you are able to walk right out your front door.
i do not like it when people are too shy or too aggressive.
never depend on a guy.
he is not gay, so do not ask him.
it is the other way around, is it not?
he is dating her and should not be considered a friend but a boyfriend.
between the two of them i am the only child.
my companion is boring and that is what i hate the most.
it is not going to be a great calm life because he leaves there.
my dear, you can marry anyone you would like.
it is fine. i have been married to a black gentleman for 15 years.

if you like the man and want a kiss, then go ahead and kiss him.
god lets things happen in our lives so we can draw closer to him.
if he does so, have fun and be tease him about it.

let him know that you are worth it and show him.

if not then do not worry about it because single life is also a good thing.
my place, your place, or the beach?
i like this guy who arrived at school a month ago.
it's because intelligent women tend to scare us and damage our egos.
do not wait because i know from experience that this is best!
the girls who scream are immature and silly, but many men like that.
you look so cute and lovely that there are not enough words in the universe to actually describe it.
she has to want to be with me.
do something like getting a job to meet more people and this will help you get over it.
i have no idea what you are talking about.

the answer is no - why do we have to be guilty?
my father is allowing me to go, despite protesting the situation.
have a blood test done for if it is his child, abandon them both as obviously they do not respect you.

just ask, it will not help if you think about it too much.
stop trying to make it work and just let it work.
would you be able to deal with it if she married someone else?
do you shave your legs, juliet?
just remember that the good looking guy you are after may be ugly on the inside.
if he never kissed a girl before then you all should wait until you are ready.
they have creams for that now.
he would have to be; tall, handsome, bald and he would have to have great personality.
is it for traction in the mud?
i don't want them to think i'm i'm a hoe.
love strikes when you are least looking for it.
waiting for the right moment may be the best course.
one cannot triumph through arguments with the feminine psyche.
sexuality as portrayed in rated xxx movies are rarely realistic.
i don't know, why don't you ask him and find out.
has she told you? or have you heard her plan this from my friend?
my father is forcing me to marry somebody in one month.
good luck. i hope you take my advice and find what you are looking for.
they have to prove their manhood.
you should not hate me because i am being honest.
try not to think about it, that will prevent you from getting hurt.
i think you wait for 31/2 - 6 years before you have sex.
sit down with her and tell her the full truth.
get up, take a shower, and watch television.
there are nice, caring, and loving people in the world.
besides, we have a large family. how could they decide who is and is not allowed to be there?
you do not have to be in love, merely to enjoy the man with whom you are in a relationship.
you will both become resentful, if you stay with a man you do not love.
bad sex is much like bad pizza - even when it is bad, it is still quite good.
if he does not understand, you could try to reconcile with him. if that fails, you should leave.
i have never been stopped by the fact that i do not love someone.
if there was, then he would not be your ex.
move a safe distance away and dont not let on that you speck english.
tell him that you want to that marriage counseling together and give him an ultamatum.
we women do not want to date a male.
i am im agreeance with the perons comment above that you might need to run.
if she complains then you are not doing it the way she likes.
women utilize it to punish men, by exciting them and then refusing them. women abuse it.
i am most attracted to mature, self-assured men who have purpose in their lives.
then, from that list, choose two reasons that you would be able to tell her.
i find it strange and and i would discard the flower.

to retrieve a pearl deep sea diving is necessary.

you should do it quietly, if he is cheating on you, you will catch him in the act sooner or later.
do not forget that the girl is not a guy!
do not go looking for trouble, because you will find it!
is it something that you do not understand or have never experienced?
the larger the woman the better!
i never liked younger girls, not even when i was younger myself.
then again, i say "seek god and pray for him!"
you have to take things slow and make sure the girl is okay with it.
another idea would be to set-up a nanny system to watch the boys until you get home.
if it goes later than that, then move on.
have you and your boyfriend/girlfriend been dating a long time?
the females are always ready to get married and, worse case scenario you get half!
that was the best gift ever.
where would you like to begin?
it is not taken orally, it is called a "bank statement."
they complain and criticize you about it.
you need to discover what is happening in his life.
but it cannot be accomplished.
the two of us are still friends and i still love her very much.
do not be selfish. pay attention to her needs, lead her and the family, do not be lazy.
but i do not know how to say that or how to apologize.
if men compliment your body/figure then be proud of it.
remember that she wants to get married.
i don't like it when guys spend too much time with their guy friends.
i think it is might be more effective if you do it by yourself.
you should tell them to keep quiet and go away. if not, you can just go ahead and shoot them.
number two is american all the way.
stop and think about why does baking or cooking have to be a girl thing.
the man in whom i was interested moved away.
help each other out and try for what you really want.
i do not know what to do.
then why are you in a relationship with him?
speak with them, but do not tell them how you feel until you understand what they think.
if she keeps looking at you, do you think you would have a chance to have a relationship with her?
i'm not looking for any specific type of man.
when i was 15, i spent time on the beach with a boy i wanted to have a relationship with.
maybe if you ask him, he can give you some tips on how to kiss him.
i will get the job done accurately, so i will not need your help tonight.
i am now living with them.  i will tell you that once someone is a cheater, they will always be a cheater.
who knows in advance how lucky they will be.
we have been dating for about seven weeks.
i still do not trust him even though he tells me he loves me.
first, you should ask her if there is a problem.
maybe you're not that sensitive and should bathe more.
i have a boyfriend and he is doing well.
that is not good for you or your baby.
yes, unless it puts someone in harm's way.
you could always try a consistent method.
things a young lady would not normally know, but are revealed to her by an unhappy ex.
he or she may not be exactly the one for whom you had hoped.  you do not need to rush.
however, if it was three weeks later, i do not know what to advise you.
sometimes, you have to allow love a chance.  everything that is good does not necessarily feel great.
allow her plenty of time to make up her own mind.
you don't know. so, i advise that you initiate conversations. at the last very least, start with a greeting, like "hey!" or "hi!" or "what's up?"
i don't know. why are you asking me?
i recommend against doing that. you might embarrass her as well as yourself.
there's an old joke that begins like this: "why do girls fake orgasms?"
personally, i do not think it matters.
it is kind of funny to think about her cheating on him on their wedding night.
they have flowers, stuff animals, balloons, and many different kinds of gift baskets for purchase.
there is nothing more to it than that.
you must love yourself first before you can love someone else.
but can i live my life without this person?
at the time, she or he was right.
loving him is all that matters.
if you can not take what is being done to you, then stay away.
i agree. some girls are very mean.
being similar to him will not make it more enjoyable, trust me.
it depends on the match, but probably not tongue.
otherwise, it is not.
if they are unfaithful with you, they will be unfaithful to you.
she has read but wants to learn about pain and pleasure, as well as experience sub-space, etc.
it was warfare and it was damnation!
i do not care if he is black or not, provided i may love him.
there are lots of men that like a clamorous, amusing, intelligent, and fashionable woman.
she has started conversing with that man.
the movie theater, pool, hot tub, bed and car were all under the stars.
try to think of it positively, you already live together.
wishing you both the best of luck!
if the gentleman does not allow you to have fun, he is not worth it.
that is like telling him that a feature is unattractive and him making changes to that feature.
plus, if they give you too much trust, people often abuse it.
i've just described myself, and i know i'm a good girl!
you've got to be more specific.
don't knock it 'till you've tried it.
you want to help him, huh?
if he really likes something, then do that. he may not care about the pantyhose.
look where her hands are.
did you give them a meaningful look or just act friendly?
decide if you accept this and then either continue or leave.
in your mid 50s it may not work as well as it used to.
just go straight to the judge and ask.
do you have a problem with his girlfriend?
it's not how big your member is but how you use it.
i prefer agressive guys to a shy guy.
was his childhood not good?
is fetishism a problem?
of course you are if you created your avatar to look like you.
i guess she sleeps with one or more of her friends. that is the only way that she could possibly get what she has.
there will be absolutely not sharing between you!
what kind of traits do girls admire in a guy?
you must have to be a expert in lying.
look the guy up and down the say, "how you doin'?"
just go home and do what you want to do.
it would be jesse mccartney.
oh it sounds like this yahoo question is meant for the forums.
the best way is to inform him.
i consider myself ready when i have both money and a college degree.
tell her you did not mean it that way.
and she is bald.
it is better to have loved because otherwise you would not know what love feels like.
we stayed married. try what we did. no one can make you stay together.
it is impossible to make a man like you.
if you love one another, it will be clear. relationships take time.
i think they will all want him!
when confronted with the truth, she backed off.
take time to make your decision.
yes, you may never know the difference.
why have you decided not to do it?
it is normal that guys have sick minds.
i am led to believe that my girl is cheating on me.
many people get married because they do not have much time left to be fertile, so they marry the person they love.
i am a woman and i do not understand.
i would post more, but for everyone who is here.
i do not know any women who think that is attractive.
it depends on how long you and her former lover have been apart.
you know small talk; let it flow.
tell her to consult "dear abby".
he asked me out five years ago.
yes. that is the first rule in girlfriend-ship. i don't care what your age is, you just do not do it.
sir, just think of her negative actions.
my husband has cheated on me so many times that i am familiar with every excuse there is.
my mother says that "stupid is as stupid does".
if that is true, then it would not be a good idea to go with him.
it is likely that i will get caught gawking at him.
i  think it is important for both of them.
you do not see him or communicate with him even.
because today i discovered what it means to be a"bad girl."
yes, i seem to think so.
sometimes it is best to wait until you are sure.
keep trying and one may stay.
everyone says they have a romantic partner.
you should look into marriage counseling sooner rather than later.
at the moment, you cannot feel it.
this should get things into motion.
i could get either a birthday or valentine's day present!
we were not meant to be alone in this world so why not do it if you really love her?
let him know you can be friends if he gets depressed about it.
consider that you are quite lucky and stop complaining.
i don't like it when a man will forget their partner's birthday or holidays.
i invite to to join us but she always refuses.
in texas it seems like all the homosexual guys enjoy montrose.
i am sixteen and love you all.
if it is not your dad, brother, or old highschool friend then it may be whoever.
if i ask you to go on a date with me what would you say?
stay cool in this heat and enjoy yourself by hangin out with him.
i am not certain she would want to wed a man who is seven years older than me.
or maybe ask yourself why your husband wants a mistress.
break up with that undesirable man and find someone nice.
i am not angry with my friend who is in a relationship with my former lover.
you should be honest, but not rude.
start slow, then go faster, and then alternate.
i wonder why you would have sex with this person?
and bigger women can be more fun sexually since they tend to have big bottoms and big breasts.
i am sorry but that is just so funny!
i can tell you that i live in south carolina, united states and i am a 14 year old girl.
i don't want to be rude, but are you going to propose to your boyfriend?
to keep your mind off of it, you need to move on.
maybe you have not found the right person for you yet.
i kissed my husband when we were dating.
we both love each other very much.
well, most men are responsive to sexual favors. alternatively, you could buy them an xbox 360.
i am single, divorced, and looking for a girlfriend.
if you want him to calm down, sit and talk with him.
that is sick, i might add, as well as illegal in most states.
do not hesitate to ask him how he feels towards you.
i apologize, i do not understand your question.
do not listen to your sister; as long as you do not mess up the dress, everything will work out.
if you are not ready, then you are just not ready.
age is a number that does not mean anything.
you should really be more descriptive, dear.
i don't think she would have traveled the distance she has if she didn't care for you.
my final piece of advice is you shouldn't get divorced, you should consider going to church.
i think this is something that could definitely be worthwhile to you.
you'll have to pay a visit to san diego, ca in order to get these.
you should not be afraid, being shy should not hold you back from approaching a man.
you need to get to know him a little bit better, but a lot better would be even better!
men often have a difficult time processing things that way.
why does it always seem as if there are no good people in the world?
talk to him alone and see if he says anything.
if you do, do not present yourself as easy.
i find it doubtful that she hates you for no reason.
that is what i think and i just turned 17.
try using some honey and vinegar.
my friend prefers a stocky woman of height 5 feet and 5 inches.
anyway, she did not use the telephone.
although you were wise, something is suspicious in your relationship.
you should know that this is a beach you are in, because this is hawaii.
he talks that way to relate with you intimately.
you could ask his friends if you really want to know.
take some deep breaths and begin.
why would you want to forget about it if you are in love?
i am sure he does.
it all depends on who you ask.
oh well, let the figure out the difficult way themselves.
are they the blonde, red, brown, or even bright colored haired women?
i'm a man, correct it is.
beauty, i also search for brains and intelligiance.
do not let someone use you.
do not take too long, she is waiting to find out.
because you have to do it some day.
for example, prostitutes have more than anyone else.
you finally figured that one out.
i don't have any issue with that.
only time will heal your heart.
the right guy will come along if you be yourself.
i personally didn't experience any pain but some women find it very painful.
there are sex scenes in decent movies but i don't like pornography.
trust me, older women are more enjoyable to have sex with.
that is what is being looked for.
don't marry this man solely for the reason that he is coming to visit you.
women are that way as well.
if you move closer and she does not back up.
being yourself is attractive to women.
porn is not for a female that respects herself or her family.
consider the day you will die.
for girls who have considered asking men on dates.
go to hell!
you need to either move or find a new group of people to go out with.
she means a lot to me and i can't stop thinking about her.
once he knows that you have kids, he won't hold it against you.
it depends on how tall she is.
if i were you, i would not take any more medication.
he may do little things.
you have to accept the fact that the girl is not bald by choice.
you have may have noticed that you do not like being alone.
if that does not work, you could tell her that you do not like him.
i consider it an act when the penis is touched.
do not do it if you are not comfortable with it.
the size of the way does not matter. the motion of the ocean is what is important.
i do not understand what you are talking about.
he considered me a friend and would not ask me out.
you can figure out how you feel when you look at things honestly.
why do you feel the need to get married at such a young age?
a bubble will help you get over any man, if you choose.
some men find athletic women intimidating, since it may make them feel inferior in ability.
there are other ways of knowing, such as nipples hardening and both pairs of lips swelling.
diseases. do you know where her friend has been?
i am not telling you to be naive and allow people to take advantage of you. i do not think you would be capable of that any longer.
sure, do not consume alcohol. enjoy reality.
think happy thoughts and do activities that you enjoy. perhaps sewing, horseback riding, watching classic movies, etc.
please, if there is a god, tell me you are kidding.
i apologize for butting in, but it is not the look they are after, rather, it is what is inside that counts.
they are like aliens that cannot understand you, and you will just think, "duh."
sorry, i tried to get his phone number but could not find it anywhere.
have her pay child support.
i am doing research on what real love is.
i will think about it if you tell me how old you are.
i would move on if he moves there.
before changing things, she should learn how things work first.
for a little while you seemed like me.
however, i would not consummate our marriage until our wedding!
so be cautious prior to doing anything inadvisable.
there is a lot to recommend about foreplay.
yes, it is possible to be in love with someone other than your spouse.
however, you must choose only one!
at least they know not to even consider cheating because of the consequences.
that was very successful for my mother and father.
she would incorrectly inform the public that i am with child.
you should not engage in sexual activity until you are completely ready.
waiting until they are more mature would be the best time to talk to them.
you'll no longer feel this hurt when you have found requited love with another.

he will try to talk to you whenever he sees you.
that is very abnormal and silly, because what kind of female does not want to kiss her man?
i know this answer because i take a psychology class.
because it feels nice or is painful in an appealing way.
although, the fact that she does not want to have children shows that she is not meant for you.
what would you do if you had the opportunity to go on a date with a former lover of one of your friends?
also, you cannot desire it too much.
you remind me of my mother. i am kidding.
there are nice men in the world.
me, my significant other, and no one else.
cheer up, it could be worse.
he was very mature when we started, but now it seems as though he is missing out on something.
perhaps we will state that we are glad to be friends.
you can tell they are great lovers because they have eyes like those of chinese people.
normally, i prefer not to touch.
truly kind, caring people are less common than it might appear.
good luck! i hope you get on well together.
tell him that you got another date.
this situation is not fair to your girlfriend and it is definitely not fair to you.
we get along well, but i think i am too old for her.
i wanted to ask her out, but i am too shy.
be funny, smart, and loud, like me.
it seems as if you surround yourself with the wrong people.
have you ever actually seen an inbred person?
that is sort of how guys are.
i am pretty shy around him, so he probably thinks that i am crazy, but he is so smart and cute.
keep on looking and the right guy will come into your life soon.
no need to concern yourself, she's not infatuated with you.
he was my first and only lover.
women have the power in relationships.
i disliked the film, however, i am still interested in romance.
i am no longer seeking a partner.
once i dated this girl from my job and it got very serious.
how can i get them together?
we did not last, he dumped me last year for good.
my instant messager name is lil_nemo_2005.
porn is bad while dating, it is like cheating on your spouse.
male armpit hair is not attractive.
some stuff it just cannot help you with.
our relation has improved so much it does not affect myt work anymore.
have you asked why their marriage ended?
he would always want to hang out and baby talk to me.
some men enjoy sporty but some do not.
i do not date because i work over sixty hours and take care of children the rest of the time.
listen to what your heart says to you.
is there a different good one where people are more real?
tell her in a sincere way.
i agree that if  a person is unfaithful once, then they will continue to be so.
search "penpals" on any online search engine.
i think the small bird or the muscle.
at that point, i feel as though there has been some action.
they also appreciate men who plead for coitus.
incest is always wrong, it is the kind of activity animals do, not humans.
or later when you realize that it is disappointing and you should not have committed this mistake.
if you have to ask, then you have not mastered it.
why do women want a boy instead of a man?
no younger than 19 unless you have a strong desire.
is the problem really that you have low self-esteem and feel depressed?
in that case, let her know something of how you feel. you should go with a girl you genuinely like.
if he loved you as much as you think he does, he would not do that to you.
you should ask him out. i think he likes you, so most likely he will say yes.
i have twenty friends. do you watch lizzie maguire?
to be in a good mood, start smiling and making conversations.
no, of course not, but if your husband or wife caught you then it is.
i agree. if he answers to the contrary, he's lying.
this lets me know this is a big deal.
it is way too young for 14-15 year old teenagers to have sex.
if you do, then you could see very easily.
should i feel bad for seeing him? i mean he did cheat on me with her.
everybody's first time is awful.  i agree, though, if by his third time he is still awful, he just might be gay.
i think they are the best so far.
no one knows if someone else is in love.  you have your opinion and it is about what you feel.
what benefits are involved with marriage that you don't receive while not married?
it is more difficult for the kids but she needs to calm down.
it isn't our age difference.
figure it out because there is plenty of life out there.
belly kisses and a hard wet neck, though no forplay.
if you choose not to explain, that will be the end of it.
of course the feel of female privates is good for boys, though are you a girl?
top it all off with a smile.
perhaps he is looking to step up to the next level such as marriage, or perhaps he is simply sex starved.
you will know it when you find what you are seeking.
my question is whether it worth trying.
i do not want to be seen as a genius anymore.
i find him to be even a less attractive person than i find you to be.
late that day, she tried to call me seventeen times but i never answered.
that is the aspect that so many people miss out on.
simply inform him that i don't care for you any longer and leave me alone.
i suggest you tell him nicely that you are not ready and it's not a good time
i appreciate a boy who doesn't let his pants sag.
their mother dated and then married a guy they didn't care for; it lasted three years and she is now divorced.
if i was able to give you a hug i would because i know that you really need one right now.
i recommend that you buy him superbowl tickets.
i recommend that you take the depo shot for birth control and don't mention it to him.
honesty is always the best policy because it shows true love
if you really love him, then i recommend that you respond yes.
i wish you could be more romantic and do more for me than bring me flowers.
can i ask why you're even bringing this up to me?
here's my confession: i have a crush on someone i attend school with.
i'm hoping he will be able to please your wife with a larger-than-average size, describe your wife to me.
we are eating at mcdonald's tonight, and it looks like two big macs will be ordered.
i like to touch the butt and his manly package.
anything can work out if you make it.
i tried to tell him why i did what i did and why i stopped.
you should stop torturing yourself and using him. you should move on.
i agree, you should make him pay your bills, but help him out in return.
i do like to associate with a few people, why do you ask?
tell your partner that real love will set them free.
can you please ask him to bring back tacos?
you can look at some magazines for ideas, or just forget the whole thing.
be sure to give him all of your attention and love him.
i should add this to my watch list.
if he wants to have a mistress then he does not deserve you.
i am looking forward to this experience.
if all else fails, then i suggest you see a specialist.
i would get his attention by dropping a barbell on him so he would have to talk to me.
but reassure them that she still loves them.
am i the only person here who likes armpits?
my brother is older but he stays for his games.
i can get it, though. should i do that and call back or wait until hebe calls back ?
i am saying this because what he did was not your fault!
whoever answered sure has some mental issues.  i would say to go to a theme park.
if he can do that, then i believe everything else will fall into place.
you don't need to worry about how you are going to live for the next part of your life.
age does not matter, but when you get married does matter.
so far, my advice has helped two friends get together!
find a man your age or wait five years.
if not then hunt and kill it!
i do not believe in backstabbing over a man, but she thought i meant it that way.
it is because you might come off as a younger sister or friend.
are you homosexuals?
don't talk too much.  when you are alone, hold her hand and go in for the kiss.
when i feel sad at work, my boyfriend tells me the same thing.
follow your heart. you are an adult.  no one can force you to do something you don't want to do.
it will depend on the situation
you deserve better, if he cannot respect that fact.
take the time necessary to be confident what a lifetime commitment is truly about.
the unfortunate part is that we are both too shy to do anything.
i will be one if you would like.
i do not need an exceedingly attractive man.
however, he said that he would still continue to assist me.
if you're looking for advice on what to look for, read the book "he's just not that into you."
being clean should be a requirement for you to continue the relationship.
if you're met with anger, be honest with him and share how you really feel.
it sounds like you are being used as a sexual object.
the results normally don't work for others your size, but it may be a good trick for you.
save sex for when you are married; keep it for that one special person in you life.
i would like to know his name so i could thank him as that was something sweet to do for a stranger.
there are a lot of perversions out there so it depends on how spicy you want it to be.
i do not know.
go for it, and let them.
i need good friends from different countries. we will have many enjoyable times together, i promise.
gather yourself and proceed with your life.
however, you grew too mature for your spouse.
it flays you and cuts deep.
if you care for him, why end the relationship?
size does matter, i am too big and wish i were smaller because it hurts the girls.
you should calm down and relax, you will know when you are ready.
i never choose to stay close to a person i dislike.
it is possible you might contract something antibiotics cannot cure.
keep your outlook on life and you will go further than they ever will.
if you are not mad then do not act mad.
i did break up with my boyfriend only to later regret it.
it depends on if you come in last.
just ignore him. the girls who he slept with probably told him that.
for myself, however, if i had to choose just one thing it would certainly be romance.
if you love one another, you will stick it out regardless.
some people find it unusual but i happen to like it and it's none of their business.
the situation will not always seem so bleak.
refrain from speaking about your exes.  you should see an answer here shortly.
i do not hate my spouse!
well, you should let them know the real you.  good luck.
trust me.  i was there 20 years ago.
that name sounds so familiar.
in the movies, we see all this great time for your first time.
the question isn't "can i live with this person for the rest of my life?"
is it fair? do you love the person the same way they love you?
i like kids but preteen are more awesome especially if they are skateboarders.
the short answer is girls look for guys who make them feel good.
did he put you off or seem busy when you called him?
i am nine years old and have a crush on a fourth grader named james creater.
no woman wants to throw herself on a man if he sees her only as a friend.
because if it is peer pressure you should leave behind those friends.
why did you not say so earlier!
numbers 26 through 39, a pickup truck filled with coors.
i am very familiar with the feeling of being fixated on a man. it is not entertaining.
you will never forget it. will the next man do this as well?
live for yourself and stop wasting time with him.
yes, do you enjoy being ill?
we don't do that and i do not think they will either.
i would describe you as a big thinker!
her legs will only fit in a mini cooper.
i am unsure, but let's continue this conversation.
i believe that it is wrong if you are not married.
choose an older man; it is better to learn from someone than have to teach them.
be proud of your personality and your nice figure.
he is a grown man and his father needs to see his son happy.
you cannot control your feelings, however you can control your actions - preserve your dignity, move on, and hope for the best.
ask if he would like to go to a picnic, a restaurant, a movie, or something else.
if it is not a great ending, it does not mean it is the end so keep your head up.
my advice is to pick the one that is the cutest.
for the lady, take care of your man because he will not admit it, but he is a big baby.
i do not really think so, it depends on what size you are.
get out there and meet some new people.
use foreplay to get stimulated faster.
i am that kind of man.
cuddle, play together, and relax often.
the man wants to marry her.
friends or church members happen to be on the internet and a pornographic website appears on the screen.
i did bleed a little bit.
tell him that you really like him.
do not try to push the issue, have patience and give him time to learn to trust you.
recently i just signed a lease with him.
everything checked out on each end.
for example, "hey, i want to see that movie, too!"
you should explain further because nobody seems to understand what you meant.
mom, dad (insert male name) proposed to me and i said yes.
it is something we were going to have to deal with sooner or later.
when i call my daughter she cries out things in my ear that rip a dad's heart out.
for example, if there are any phone calls the day after the first date, then you should not go on a second date.
they might or might not find this a big surprise.
i don't think that anybody is that nice.
do not let her get away with that.
if that does not work, find him another girlfriend and leave him.
friends are to have some one to lean on in times of need.
do not go for it at all.
i believe the hispanic culture is like this.
if you whould like to call me please feel free.
all throughout the world i have used mine.
i have found simply asking someone to accompany you on a date is the best way to begin.
you can't really show love in terms of a lot or a little.
the first thing you have to do is learn to appreciate and love yourself.
you know exactly what i mean when i mention a scent.
my mother will always be one of the women who hold a very dear place in my heart.
what do you do to make him feel special?
you will find a much better man.
well flirt with him first and try being friends.
you must respect yourself more than that.
ask her if you want the answer.
my friend, you are above being a girlfriend.
your father does not like him but your mother does.
i hope that helps and the best of luck to you.
when i was younger i did.
i know exactly what you are going thru.
she will get over it quicker, and you can have fun doing it.
she may say that she is okay with this, but chances are she will not.
it does get better, but be prepared to use protection. just enjoy yourself.
listen closely to me when i tell you this man was unfaithful to you.
first you must decide if he is the right person for you when you meet him.
she will get over it mush faster that way, and you can have fun doing it.
she might say that she is fine with this, but chances are, she will not be.
it does get better, but be prepared, use protection, and enjoy yourself.
read my lips; this jerk just cheated on you.
first meet him, then decide whether or not he is right for you.
why don't  you sit her down and say you love her.
i hope you can help her out.
so far my parents  haven't told me i'm going to hell.
i hope you get aked out by this guy, he seems like a nice guy.
do you love him, and want to marry him?
ask him your questions. if you are satisfied with the answers, go ahead with your decision.
it depends on your budget.
do you like it? i thought of it myself.
you got it exactly right.
you have found the shortest way to hell, if he doesn't divorce her.
in summary, you have waited four years for the gutters.
find a new boyfriend, and leave your old one. good luck.
i'm 15 years old, 5 feet 4 inches tall, with pinkish hair.
i must agree - you should never wait five years for a man.
i am single and i'm looking for someone who is single too.
it helps keep our sex life interesting.
if you don't mind the itching.
because i feel so lonely at school.
i think you have a misunderstanding with your girlfriend.
either that or it hurt her.
thirty-six is not to old because my sister in law is forty and has one.
just do it and if it doesn't work out  you know you have tried.
my boyfriend was never like that.
you take a day at a time and don't trust you head or your heart for at least a year.
people ask that question every ten minutes!
i say it depends on how much and where you're shaving!
no, your to young to have sex!
if your friends are having sex it doesn't mean you have to.
with lovey dovey thoughts on your mind.
they are usually already taken or are gay.
the guy is real sweet to me.
if she's not into it, then quit waisting your time.
i like someone who is 9 years older than me.
do something with her on feb 14th.
there's enough sperm in pre cum to get you pregnant.
because it's another word for
actually men are most of the the initiator.
i do belive in true love, and soul mates.
she watches them more than he does!
just throw it out and buy a new one.
i'm proud to be one!!
if you want to tell her, just tell her.
thanks for inviting me to answer you questions.
it is not harmful in any way, buy some body pudding and eat it like it's candy.
but a lot of girls like roses, sunflowers,tulips,lilies,orchids and carnations.
cyber sex is just like phone sex.
let me be friends with each other and buy a larger bed.
i am no expert, but i have been there.
your mother is your only mother.
i sounds as if she is just upset, because her other relationship did not work out.
talk about things that you both like and go from there.
sir, the phrase "safe, unprotected sex" is an oxymoron.
but we humans are sexual beings and that's good.
he doesn't even know that i exist!!!
some guys also like books, magazines , posters and collectibles.
some people don't have a problem swallowing and some do.
after all, no matter what you do, his kids aren't going to disappear.
if this is something that is meant to happen, it will.
i can't say i'm sure who yours is, but i do wonder if i would ever consider having one.
the best thing you can do at this point is to end the relationship and don't look back on it.
if necessary, you can always use your tongue to expel it.
you should start the conversation by saying you know she will be happy for you.
you should only let him know if he feels the same way.
decline the drama with you your child's mother.
have you considered that you are the reason that you aren't happy and that it isn't because you are single?
start slowly and the apply heavy amounts of pressure.
it might be simpler to probe her.
i think i recall her name, but to what concern?
shouldn't we learn proper grammar?
do you have any reminiscences that irk you to this day?
please have someone take that responsibility from you.
in spite of the emotional difficulty this inflicts, you must distance yourself from her or you will never fully recover.
to all my adversaries, you have my forgiveness.
perhaps others can convince you that it is not the best course of action.
if i cannot handle a matter independently, i will call for assistance.
is my life determined by luck, or am i simply inept?
being celibant is not a useless way to spend time.
you are not ready for the many things that may happen.
if he is taking plenty care of you.
no one is doing it.
even if you do not find a wife, you will still have fun.
try looking around the mall in your hometown.
my grandmother died a year ago at the age of 103, she was like a mother to me.
it is not true that guys like sex more than women.
for a guy it's the other way.
i would go with the first guy, he's not really great looking but his personality is great.
would you grab the money, run up to the guy, and hand it back to him?
it might work out if you have a lot in common.
just say, "will you go out with me?"
this might be the one for you.
if you are that well built, why are you asking this question?
being in love can really drive a person crazy.
you will discover later on that you are in love with him!
second, no matter how old you are, you need to remember that your ex became your ex for a good reason.
do some nagging, because maybe they are too arrogant about themselves.
do you mean true love and passion or just chemical passion that is lust (because the latter never lasts)?
individuals in their 20's tend to be a bit wilder as they are still in their prime.
when you're in love, you won't need other's confirmation. you will know it.
let him go. you will have problems in your relationship if your ex is still around.
i still like her even though she is having sex with one of my friends.
at the very least you will know immediately if he returns your feelings.
some peoples friendships always work out in the end.
you should take precaution on the body size, most men do not enojy huge chests
always be positive in everything you do is rule four.
be yourself is the best you can do.
show them you care by asking.
does he appreciate you the way he should?
i think there is something wrong with you. find someone your own age.
anger is not an excuse for anger.
he can be arrested because you are a minor.
you both like each other, just talk to her and she won't reject you.
he is unable to make eye contact with you.
i like intelligent, handsome men who have a great sense of humor, are outgoing, and love to have fun.
i agree with the two ladies.
it helps to make all the rest bearable.
nope, it was wrong and what you did was admirable.
do you really like him? is a nice guy? if he wants you back then why not.
does he even see other women?
ask her why she is like.
let me know when you find out.
beauty is only skin deep!
these things make a friendship stronger, and i hope i was able to help you.
at the end of the day there is no difference.
he had a horrible life because his father beat him.
i do not think i would be happy right away.
when you go out, you should look at the couples around you.
she probably assumed that you are scared.
you should sincerely say, "baby, i am so sorry. how can i make it up to you?"
at least he will now wash up.
you are still growing; your current "baby fat" may go away, but it may not.
you should ask her about her hobbies.
can i be intoxicated without drinking?
i hope you find the man of your dreams.
is he not satisfied because you are not?
live life to your own standards.
you love her because you believe she is good for you.
i have never used a pick up line.
if they are merely friends, then you should tell her how you feel.
you are merely in love with him.
most guys seem to appreciate women with large breasts.
it is not good to be a lesbian.
she did not like that i lied, so she left.
there is a person who cares about you, just have to find them.
would you want to be married and miserable or single and happy?
you should hang out with different women.
that doesn't mean that only one lid exists.
find somebody else to rub.
flirting is fine with moderation.
i will meet him for the first time on sunday.
i wish he will be like you and not worry about his last girlfriend.
you should talk to her and find out why she put you in that situation.
it is possible to get a girl pregnant.
what makes you notice a guy.
when you find out the information, lets hope that he has a brother.
if you have to ask this question, then there is love.
the best people receive the most hate.
i am a woman and i do not believe that is possivle, however, try to gain her attention.
even if you love him, you still deserve better.
one time is was really bad.
is anyone friendly with frank or denise?
at the bare minimum, the shaft and the sack need attention.
the girl in our hometown seems like a person you want to keep in contact with.
this is very important, i cannot stress enough that you should get out of that situation!
so in the end, he will get what is coming to him and so will you.
do not be concerned because you can repair this.
if you are not authentic that you will never truly fall in love.
why do you not try asking, "do you like anyone?"?
how can i tell if he likes me or if he is misleading me?
i do not agree. it ought to end with being old but happy together forever.
it is dependent on the topic. do you mean life in general?
i think that there are two or three others as well, are there not, my suspicious friend?
it is somewhat warm and fur-like on the inside.
no, it would make you a more arousing 36-year-old woman.
because we do not understand ourselves.
alright, there are a lot of good looking black men at my school.
do what ever she says and love her.
i agree with what they said, plus, please correct your spelling of cyber.
just tell him to stop acting like that around you.
what does it mean?
straight up and down, without any curves.
my dad just had a disagreement.
what would happen if you catch an std?
it does not look like they matter that much.
i would consider leaving him if he doesn't have a good explanation.
you will be incredibly disappointed and it will hurt tremendously.
the two of you are more like strangers than friends.
there is no guarantee that you will marry or even be together long term just because you are currently in love.
you will find out if you ever fall in love.
at the very least she should be allowed to hear your voice at that time.
on occasion women to women talk is alot easier.
i have discovered i do not enjoy women bigger than me.
some times things were not meant to be.
make him pine for you then deny him for you are too big for him.
i am just very excited to put my arms around you and hold my nose to your neck.
you are a young, married couple so, it should be fun.
it merely depends on if you care deeply about that person and would attempt changing the world if only to see a smile across their face.
yes, life can be very hard, still life goes on.
after many years, it is still great and getting better.
some things you can't fix and all you can do is service them.
i am not a fan of angelina jolie.
that cannot sleep before intercourse.
don't let anything ruin your relationship if you care for your partner.
doc martens may not be attractive but boots are attractive when worn by a woman.
everyone is like that, you should get use to it.
my friend had a girl that really tried to show that she liked him.
i think he is afraid of getting himself in a commitment.
do not get caught up in the drama.
i realized that it was either the next guy or myself who would get the girl.
are you looking for an asian girl?
did that cause you to have a miscarriage?
that was not understood because the english was not clear.
best wishes in overcoming that serious challenge.
people act upset if a man only lives up to 90% of expectations or if a woman's hair is too short.
from there you should be able to tell if he is right for you or if he needs to go.
it depends on what you think it is.
are you flirty with other guys?
i have a lot of guy friends.
the sad part is that a lot of people skip the fourth step.
it seems a little strange that you would comment on the looks of his new secretary.
two kids later, i still got it, but she does not.
that is the best thing you can do.
since you do not deserve that, you should really break up with him and forget about hum.
depends on weather or not you look for guys who are in really good shape.
no, its normal, just don't go broadcasting it.
be nice and respectful to her husband and she won't mind when you call.
remember the good and let go of the bad to move on.
be polite and smile to make the want to know more about you.
if you are ready, then you are ready to have intercourse.
was it lack of interest or were you not stimulated?
but if he loves you, then tell him it is twenty more pounds to love.
yes, you are homosexual, not straight.
women do not care about intercourse very much.
watch a football or baseball game, go fishing or hunting, learn about cars, and similar things.
yes, i am 31 and he is 47.
certainly, you are able; simply choose the good one.
simply approach her and then open your mouth and speak.
telephone her every day to say hello.
infatuation and love are very much alike.
you sound like me and we should have a conversation.
does physical attraction matter when it comes to love.
newer questions tend to recieve more activity on yahoo.
it is twice the original amount of woman, why would a guy not like that?
are you unintelligent? how are people you do not know meant to know what kind of men you are interested in.
one thing i do not appreciate is being asked on a date over instant messaging.
all that matters is whether you want a relationship like number one, two, or three.
i do not want anyone to be able to say i ask for too much.
it is not normal for a woman to have a penis.
they are pretending to love you, but they don't.
do not lose hope even though your situation is hard.
take a deep breath and then ask your question!
i have similar women problems.
i am 13, and i do not have one yet.
unless you wanted to keep your options open, why would you want to?
eyes, stomach, lips, butt, and heels.
women are looking for men. if you are attractive, a woman will be in your life.
if you do not try,, you will never know whether or not you like men.
it's terrible when you cannot imagine your life without them. then suddenly you find that they've cheated on you.
in the fact that he stated that he'd care for you, that it wasn't working.
if amputating your penis doesn't help, then cut off your hands.
that man is an idiot, you will be as well, if you let him accuse you.
she's looking for a reason to complain.
either that or you might be looking for a new beau.
he flirts a little too much.
some men are just like women.
you will know if she flirts with you.
if you will get some counseling you will be alright.
a friend with his dad stares at you longer than normal.
i am not comfortable with doing it at all but he thinks i should be more compromising.
what if she does not like you anymore?
you will have your answer if you ask.
no, it is not a bad thing.
unfortunately, if you do not know then we are unable to tell you.
if she is already married, then maybe it is better to be just friends.
are you having a big burger and fries as your meal?
i really do not know what to do.
that would the same as if i asked "why can men not construct proper sentences?"
no, i would not shave it all off.
crushes are people whom you find attractive.
i am in a similar position.
always make an attempt to be less talkative, and to act mysterious in front of men.
that is very controlling; does he have sex at work?
hopefully, guys will answer this one.
do not hold it against me, though.
i think that is a great idea and i feel as if you should just make a fresh start.
do whatever it takes, within reason, to make him listen.
guys only focus on women's private parts, they don't care about anything else.
it will be much more clear when you ask her out on a first date.
just tell him how you feel.
well, it seems that you're doing everything right so far.

if he has feelings for you then he will be patient with you.
i called my boyfriend from high school on the phone after twenty-six years of not speaking to him.

she means that you reminder her of her brother and she does not want to go out with you!
he even muttered "gotcha!" one day when he saw me, was shy and looked down.
yes.  that was one of my father's drinking friends.
if you really love him, then why would you ever break up with him?
but, you have to be prepared for him to put an end to it.
good luck in your future.
how can i prove to him in not, i have told him repeatedly that i an not.
i spent last weekend there, and it was like staying with my sister.

in your case, i would break up with him.
it does not matter where you are; there are attractive people everywhere.

everyone gets horny no matter how old are they.

he was such a dull then.
it could really help with self esteem.
perhaps there are times when he prefers to spend time with his friends.
you told me why!
you should make a new friend or fight openly with her and tell her she is being very rude.
but most boyfriends tend to move your head up and down, indirectly causing headaches.
my first time was with my friend when i was fifteen years old.
you can ask his friends if he does, and proceed from there.
if you hate it, then tell him you do.
have him see another girl and see which one he chooses.

then he will not take you seriously.
there is never too much until you have a child.
why are you taking a census, i am single.
we men are not perfect and whomever thinks they are are fooling themselves.
it is too easy to get a divorce.

somebody has to break the ice.
if you didn't like your girlfriend, then why would you spend 9 months with her?
she is chinese and black, who has long hair and takes good pictures.
you will never turn around with that attitude. the key is being optimistic.
needless to say, she understood what i was attempting to tell her.
perhaps at the age of fifteen, i am not certain, it has not happened for me as of yet.
he stated that males do not apologize, that it is simply that you are with one that does not, how unfortunate.
did you not inquire this question previously?
yes, if the sex was really that good.
i love my ex, but she broke up with me. how do i get her back?

yes, i have been friends with this man for approximately five years.
i know how it feels. it is very painful and i want to die.
will it be with a man you know and will it only happen the one time?
please, ask her what time it is at the moment.
if it seems like the girl is annoyed with what you are doing then that most likely means that she is no longer interested or wants you to stop.
sex is not about love it is only sex and nothing more.
if you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to email me and i will respond to you as soon as i can.
i have had sex with many women but i tend to focus on the quality of the woman rather than how many i have sex with.

you should lose weight, become attractive, and break up with him.
some women have odd shaped breasts which i find repulsive.
there are a lot of people who need that special something so they create it for themselves.

i don't agree with society's unspoken rule of remaining friends.
consider the member of your family who told you this would end.
you aren't able to locate them because you're asking irrelevant questions.
whenever i am not speaking to my significant other, she asks if i am angry with her.
please sit with him and have an intimate conversation.
if you have romantic feelings for her, simply ask her to go on a date with you.
simply, tell him that you need more time.
why did the two of you break up in the first place, when the relationship could so easily start again?
it is merely what i see in my neighborhood.
trust the elder on this topic.
try to go on a vacation together, with no one else. do something different and wild together.
tell them about each other, then decide which is best for you.
usually it means "i do not want to."
again, do not put up with this.
because you are somewhat shy, and you will have to get over that later on in life.
you do not need to show it.
however, do not directly ask if she will be your girlfriend.
i hope i was able to help you a little.
even though i am overweight by 40 pounds and do have my ups and downs, i am generally happy.
by investing hard work into myself it has given me the ability to achieve what i want more easily.

choose whichever best suits you.
men are primarily searching for a place to have intercourse, while women require a reason.
i would not say that it is true, especially due to the diseases that exist.

therefore, if you want to have intercourse with a married man it is up to you.
will you stop dreaming about pamela anderson 5.
give them the information face to face and be brave and honest, then move on.
i do not want to go as low as to be one of those chicks that would fight for their man.
i like the way he speaks, his voice, his attitude, the way he walks, and his innocent smile.
it's okay if you are careful and smart about it.
they love that person and think they can spend the rest of their life with them.
i have been in a good relationship for three years.
so that is how i know.
i hope you do not like desperate girls.
you need to giver her space, so she can be herself.
give your credit card details, too.
he can have his after you have yours.
that would be wasting my time.
i do not care if someone swears only occasionally and when it is appropriate.
dress nicely, take care of your personal hygiene.
i know that it angers him.
despite what movies indicate, do not try to be her friend initially.
if he says no, simply reply that you are still going, and he can contact you if he wishes to come.
but when my sister-in-law husband's dad died, they were all up in it.
spams are sneaky little guys, so maybe he is hiding.
give it a time and you won't feel the same way about him.
you know your man, so follow your heart!
i want it and she doesn't.
most men have a feature that they find undesirable in a woman.
if any of us had it from him, why would we give it to you?
did he have six children with one woman or multiple?
whether or not it works depends on how much both of you want it to work.
perhaps inform him that he is too small.
oh really? how cute is he, and why do you want to get rid of him?
i am sorry to be so honest, but you should have known what kind of person he was before you committed yourself to him.
yes, one of my brother's friends died his hair and it was way too blonde.
there is no color in the sky.
he needs to speak about the potential of her leaving.
inform him he should no longer try and he should leave them alone.
i do not know. i only want the points.
if you are unable to find a person sexually attractive without their being physically attractive, then you would value them.
as the original person said, you have to learn to like yourself first.
approach him without apparel and kiss him.
in order to be successful with a female and to prove masculinity, you must have the courage to speak with her.
there is nothing in common, being exactly the same is not good either; nothing about this was pleasing.
whether you believe it, or not, they are in existence.
i do not know but i am certain who is the love of my life.
if he would like you to attend then he will ask you directly.
a few of my friends are calling me too old.
is that the best advice when looking for flowers?
i am married to him!
how old does he look to you?
was it you or him who wanted to end the relationship?
did he stand you up at prom?
if your best friend is interested in you and asks you out, then you should accept.
what kind of sites are we referring to?
before anyone else can believe in you.
not 200 pounds because i am already as big as it is.
kissing only leads to other things.
if you are acquainted with him then speak with him as a friend and perhaps he will start to like you.
it would be entertaining for you while you are looking.
i would want it to be another woman or anything that would be pleasing to my partner.
i am a former daughter-in-law and i address mine by her first name.
that's strange, it sounds like she is looking for a way out.
it is okay if he is legally separated.
lingerie, candles, and massages are a hint she wants a sexual relationship, if you get my drift.
oh, how these messages set her heart on fire!
like i said, it is up to the couple.
therefore, proceed with going to bed with him.
do not attempt to inform her where she is mistaken.
that is quite inhumane. you ought to leave that relationship.
greetings, my friend. do you like this girl very much?
i am not fooling anyone. it is about it all.
you should look for a guy that is not a jerk.
you should be yourself, if he is the one for you then he will make you happy.
spend time loving yourself and the right person will run you over in a big red truck - mine did!
fluteboy is really annoying.
it may happen if you give more details, but i wish you the best of luck.
you can try and find out from another friend of his to see if they know anything.
she will be there for you as well.
there are so many diseases out there, you don't want to get one.
you are special just the way you are.
neither of you is a mind reader.
i wish i could take my own advice; do not end up like me.
my best advice is to stand out, be yourself, be fun, but do not be shy or annoying.
but do his friends and family count as well?
if there is a problem, we talk first.
many girls your age believe themselves to be obese, but they are not.
so why make the attempt if the only bonus is his appearance?
it is her way of telling you that she no longer loves you.
try to find him through the college he attended. you can usually contact people that way.
coitus is a very intimate activity and should be done with the person you love and intend to marry.
they both say they love me very much.
one of my friends is interested in a man who she believes to be cute, but i think he is unattractive.
i have known her for five years.
also, we kick our underwear up into the air to see if we can catch them.
also their posteriors. at least i am honest, i appreciate a nice posterior.
you will know because you will feel so great about everything in your life.
indeed, the number one thing i look for in guys is the future.
study and do not get in fights with my sister.
yes, but i think it is really difficult.
i would...wait, i have.
if that is not effective, then he is useless. break up with him.
someone who wants to be their friend as well as their lover.
he almost certainly finds you attractive.
in what kind of clothing do you think i should dress?
that man will never respect you again if you make it last too long.
cheating means you have no devotion to love.
not getting an erection is a turn off.
i do not enjoy fat women.
just watch when the two meet.
maybe you need to find a new partner.
i don't see a way you can accomplish that without hurting one of them in the process.
why does it matter if you go with another guy if the two of you are only friends?
you're in love, so don't be afraid -- just go on.
you should just come right out and ask him if "shucks" was meant as a good thing.
so in other words, just openly ask them what they do.
i don't know. i have the same problem. he isn't my best friend, just a friend.
if we can't, then it's time to break it off.
i had the same problem. a great website helped me through my marriage problems.
she is not too ugly.
accept him if you like him in that way as well.
the men might like larger breasts, but what counts is if you like having them.
yes, you can, at 10pm weekdays and 11pm on weekends.
he is not worth this, even if you love him.
he is just a man, someone who supposedly has evolved from the apes!
i am single, but some people told others they thought i was married.
the reasons are that they are in love and that they do not want to spend the rest of their life alone.
this man must be a deviant.
he is good to me and my kids; i love him.
she stays with you because she is fat.
i also say no.
what is your problem?
that is all my words.
i have a lot of male friends. should i fornicate with them?
should i go out with him again?
have you changed for the better?
my family is under the impression that if he really cared, he would be here.
she does not want to attend counseling, despite him already going.
i don't understand why you would remain with a man who has physically hurt you.
if your significant other is trying to control you, they are not following the word of god.
be sure to share your feelings with him, and make sure he knows his opinion matters to you.
simply tell her how you feel.
your parents do not have to like your boyfriend, you do.
i am not attracted to women who weigh more than i do.
she wants to be friends, nothing more.
trust me, do not hassle him about it.
the book some refer to as the bible, states the tongue has no control.
it may be more respectful not to post her full name on the internet.
if you are inquiring in general, it may have to do with sexual preference.
if one is just visiting, it seems you will not need to see him often.
keeping in contact with her is advisable, though perhaps keep it brief.
it means that you have moved on, and accepted that she is in a new relationship.
tell him that you enjoy his game, and admire his game play.
with friends like that, who needs enemies?
my preference is the liquid with royal jelly.
truly, i like both of them, but i am unsure of how to proceed.
it is possible that he feels something special with this other girl. also, do you really want her leftovers?
time is the best answer for everything.
you are crazy, that is nothing but shadows.
if she does not believe that he dislikes her, then you should both ask him together.
she is willing to do just about anything for him.
it's a good idea to put this person first.
looks aren't that important, it's what is on the inside that matters the most.
this was one of the most enjoyable times i have ever had.
i am looking for a partner with qualities very similar to his.
end your friendship with her. that is not at all acceptable.
i said, "alright, that is acceptable."
of course, i was flattered and pleased.
we are not concerned with a little extra weight, especially in the backside.
i prefer approximately a 36c, however, they must be real.
i am personally not infatuated with gay guys.
is that not what webcams are for?
would both of you own it?
i hardly ever see him in school either. i usually only see him at my brother's basketball games.
i love to sing and i love having a free personality.
why are you interested in obese women? what is the difference, if there is any, with being with one physically?
i would tell my boyfriend how much i love him and save my sister.

just be aware of your surroundings and watch out for anything out of the ordinary.
we're not constantly thinking about making love to someone.
another plus is that there are financial benefits to this.
if you are not sure you are ready for a relationship, you should let him know.
how can you do that to your best friend?
when it comes to dating, looks matter most and personality second.
i enjoy sex more than she does.
i have said that before to end a date.
it is okay to have a male as a friend.
while some caucasian women will not date colored men, some will.
it is okay if you do it that way.
you should not be having sex with your friends, you should be shopping or hanging out with them.
why do you let him think that you are not going?
'mom' and 'dad' seems too personal to me.
try not to be shy and do not freak out if he turns you down.
hearing a person swear all the time is not pleasant.
i am so sorry i hurt you.
seriously, learn to like yourself first.
i like "girly" girls, but not shy girls - so i can talk to her.
whichever cruise line you choose, tell them you are celebrating.
you do not have to please his every whim in order to have a happy marraige.
he has a nice face, but he is a little overweight.

#3 when you are falling in love you love the idea of being together.
i don't want to hurt him so how do i get him to trust me?
not all boys act like that.

being a bad person is not what anyone wants.
i am at a loss for what to do.
i will receive the money and return to him...
do not stay in a relationship if you have knowledge that it is not going to work.
in my opinion, i would rather be solicited about my preferences.
since i returned, i have spent all free time with my girlfriend.
i am referencing his personality not his libido.
i prefer to choose based on their personality.
i am sorry to disappoint you; however, remember that no one is perfect.
ask her what some of her fantasies are.
your weight shouldn't matter if he reall loved you.
do i answer this part yeah or nay?
if you really like her she may remove that.
he may or may not know what he wants yet.
you already made your decision.
i bet she is also happy.
go for her instead of her friend.
i told him no one is ever ready.
so far he is not a psycho.
you are being dishonest about having bones in it.
3 is not thinking or caring about anything.
you cannot take it back.
i think the 2nd answer is the best, you tell him what is in your heart.
i do not dislike, i am just fearful!
i say awful things when i get mad.
on a scale of one to ten, you are a ten.
you would not like it if it was the other way around.

anytime you can get a cute girl, you should go for it.
i like for them to take complete control in the bedroom.
however, i still want intercourse day and night.
i have a mess of emotions where i am scared of it, love it, and hate it all at once.
i do not like asking anyone for anything for just that reason.
a man wants what he is interested in.
you didn't think of the consequence.
if they seem like a total mismatch, tell them not to worry.
that's like asking me about women social circles.
if you keep appologizing don't you think that's proof enough you're sincere?
they are full of sluts over there!
this is contingent upon whether you are male or female.
this is so abysmal that i might desire death.
you are fortunate to have found a mate that many females find desirable, so continue the relationship.
attempt to woo her again by sending flowers.
if you are not funny, then i suggest you receive cosmetic surgery.
the most important thing is that you never say that again.
that means she thinks the two of you are close. do not tarnish her opinion of you.
and want to hear from you.
also, congratulations to the both of you.
then you can talk a lot.
try a better question, about something you both like.
also, she is not in my school.
i did not read your other question.  talking is a good thing.

i never stay friends with past lovers.
someone who cannot type must save his life.
they do not need extra fuel for the machine.
unless they are pointed, low-rise boots, they are attractive, in my opinion.

when men are obese enough to have breasts, i always say, "a-cups for me, please."
you are too young. what if you get her pregnant?
do i accept them back or take someone else?
a good lover pays attention to what you like.
i don't like people who cuss.
you should be friends with him.
does he have a reason not to trust you?
jut hit her in the eye.
perhaps because certain undergarments cover two cheeks.
i personally do not believe that all black men behave that way!
if she left you it is not valuable enough.
he loves me when i do wrong and when i do right.
i know that is how i would feel.
after all, you guys are best friends.
anyone can look at a person and tell if they love their significant other.
i want to know if he is really going to change.
find another girl; they are a dime a dozen.
it depends. do you know the man?
it is only wrong to do it.
or he will find someone to fill his.
it is as though there is a brick wall around my heart.

you either trust him or you do not.
i call my father-in-law "dad."
being their friend takes priority, worry about the rest in the future.
who do you desire more, your friend or a significant other?
wait until you are in love with someone.
wait for him to ask you to move in with him.
perhaps being unfaithful towards you was a mistake and she knows she was wrong.

i told a friend that i was interested in her but she did not feel the same.
in my experience, it is much more attractive, especially for women to shave.
my boyfriend cooks food for me often.
break up with her and proceed with your life.
do not mind the mood swings, okay?
you need to forget about the thirteen-year-old that you are in love with.
no one enjoys an ex being around.
if you continue to ignore it, something will break.
however, i am also a man who likes posteriors.
sometimes it will work, but it is the end that matters greatly.
if you know that she is a good person and you do not care what other people think, then be a good friend.
that quality is probably more dangerous in a woman.
you lied to her. she will probably never return to you.
it is a matter of age. the men you know are in the peak of their sexual interest. it would seem you are in your teenage years or your twenties.
it seems as though the both of you have been married for five years.
it is important to me that my wife desire it as much as i do.

and that is your real mother?
did that happen after you were married?
that is something she will remember.
i have been working out and eating more.
we loved each other.
we were both angry at eachother from lastnight, but we discussed it and resolved most of our issues.
get an education before you worry about any other things.
what a question, but we should think.
he will be breaking off the relationship with her soon.
men do not envision romance like we do.
there are many nice men in the world.
show him that you are a nice match for him.
if it is a teenager, then he will think he will be able to have intercourse with her.
i do not think it is bad to want to proceed with your life.
it depends on where she got married.
please do not try to impress a man.
the only thing women are interested in is sex.
she is my closest friend, can you please help me?
how old were you when you had your first kiss? please give me details.
a person having nice eyes and a good looking smile makes them much more attractive.
i agree, the eyes are a large portion for me as well.

simply remember one thing - love conquers all.
nothing is ever certain in a relationship but if you feel a special attraction then it is worth investigating, do you not agree?

your friend has been awful to you while all you've done nothing but supportive of them.
i am nineteen, she is twenty-four, and we often spend time with her younger brother.
i can hardly wait for the new school year to begin.
that was the first thing that i could remember.
he would be proud of you if he were a mature man.
i know i love her. do you have any advice for me?
do not berate yourself, there will be more time to get serious in the future.
we talked together for a time, then i left.
because you are having intercourse with men.
it is either their appearance, social standing, wealth, etc.
everyone is so busy with their own lives that they are too busy to sit around and gossip.
i like sex and ice cream.
i believe they are at home with their wives.
thank you for that; i feel like i really deserved it.

however, it is best not to disrespect your parents, as you don't want them to evict you.
i'm very interested in this one particular boy who is very attractive.
you are taking a risk by getting involved with that, but again, it's your decision.
before you make a final decision, talk to him and gauge his reaction.
homosexual females aren't gay; they're lesbians.
because women believe everything is unsanitary.

you will have your ups and downs within a relationship.
not knee high boots, but high heeled boots and a skirt. i think that would look nice.
show up undressed with beer and do not block the television.
i waited until i was 18 and it was on my wedding night.
when you stop doing activities together.
you have proved to me that your character is egotistic.
do not worry, life or god generally point the right direction
given you are a male, choose between a female that is 32 and 39 years of age.
some simply want it, while others who are unsuccessful try hard.
ask her on a date and analyze her response.
i am bi-sexual but i am married to a male.

do not worry sir.
i prefer to feel not see.
do whatever you need to make you and others happy.
having sex with my girlfriend without using a condom.
because he thinks that he is not required to.
is it because you do not want it to end up with the wrong person?
hello, how are you?
yes, though there is a person causing everything.
i am not necessarily looking for a companion and you sound in desperation.
some men enjoy oral sex, however some would rather be on the giving end.
given that he is not committed to another individual.
i believe he will state precisely what he desires.
do not look needy in regards to it.
a nice appearance without a personality is boring.
it depends on where he is looking, do you understand?
or something you know he needs or something for personal care, such as a watch, wallet, belt, etc.
when it interferes with watching sports.
do not abandon him, simply be there for him.
i often think about how i also deserve to have someone to love.
are only men to supposed to function in that manner?
if he really loves you, keep him.
send her items such as candy and/or flowers.
you cannot make anyone love you.
you never want to have regrets and say, "i wonder what would happen if i dated...?"
i know this is a cliche, but eyes can say a lot about a person.
do not confuse him with the typical obnoxious jock. he is not like that.
there's an obvious explanation for that: boys at that age are ruled by their hormones.

if the both of you do not have someone special in your lives, then what is the problem?
if you are parting well and you will not regret it, then that is fine.
you did the right thing. i probably would have told her to never come back.
it is strange that many women ask that question on here, but never ask what they gain from it.
i reply, and we go on.
it is pretty stupid to not like someone because they wear braces.
avoid girls if you want to enjoy life.
that is why it is important to be married first.
if you answered yes to the first question, you just have to start courting.

have you ever had a mouthful of hair?
tell him directly.
how do i get her to come back?
all men are interested in sex.
what do you like; brains, boobs, behinds, or blue eyes?

i think that not knowing is worse.
flowers, candy, and a soft kiss on the forehead.
first of all, you can not show him, but you can tell him.
you need to befriend women, not men.
ask her to bend over, then kiss her posterior.
perhaps he is mentally unstable and slow.
i enjoy looking nice every day.
he is there with me. i have been interested in people before but not like this. he is not homosexual.

after viewing it she found making tapes sexy.
i hope this has helped you find your answer.
write me back on my question: how to get a date when you are unliked.

i need advice: my partner seems to try really hard sometimes and nothing happens.
i compare it to a woman being so loose, it is like trying to fornicate with a hula hoop.
i go about once a week and i am 59, so let's take it from that point.
he may be just starting because he's really attracted to you.
try to figure out why she doesn't think you two are compatible.
he also shows me he loves me in other ways and you deserve that too.
have sex with him and test him out, if he cums fast he may love you too.
if he is cheating on you, find someone else.
you don't find love it finds you.
i am talking about friends not about married couples.

that is being very mature.
i am a girl so is that normal?
i am going to tell you a secret, to marry you do not need a strong body,, you need a strong p.n.s.
retype this question so others might know what you are asking.
stop and pray in the midst of your understanding, because only god can keep you from killing them.

it is not as if she is an adult entertainer.
if the woman gives her attention and respect to her partner.
you can run from that, many men run too.
no, she does not see you in that way, she would prefer to be "just friends".
i have already done this, and it was very fun.
i believe that there is someone for everyone, and that is it possible for you to find your "special someone" too.

it is wrong to flirt with the same man that your friend likes.
at this point there should be no questions as to what either of you mean.
should i give up or keep trying?
my advice is to stop worrying about getting married; it will happen when you least expect it.
you probably already realize this, but he is not very mature.
do not fret or plan what to do during sex.
i would think yes, because he seemed like your father or something. people will talk about you.
sorry, but i am a man and my wife is asking the same thing.
you said you broke up with your boyfriend yesterday.
if it feels good, why stop?
only if she going to be the one you really want to spend your life with. aids is not something you want.
ask him if he feels the same. if he does not, then another man will find you.
my advice is to follow your emotions and you will be fine.

do not worry, i am the one who has the picture. the other one is a pretender.

if you were dating for a while why did you break up?
i saw you and it was instant love.
i am not sure why i am answering this if i do not know the answer.
you have spelled your name wrong. it is anonymous.

i don't think so, or at least, not on my own pleasure.
the question to be asked is whether you like him.
especially when it is happening to you.
no one really knows other than yourself, but you look gay.

refrain from asking her in an unnerving manner, please.
while i know that he is unhappy, i am not sure of how to assist him.
my favorite flowers are snapdragons.
if you desire a definite response in the near future...

i know because that just happened to me last week.
just have fun and do not worry about what he is going to say or think.
hey, tino, let's go out on saturday.

in my opinion, she should not be angry.
keep trying, and i wish you luck.
if you cannot, then get someone who you both know and respect.
ask the woman on a date before she asks you, because it is polite.
as long as there is love felt by both of you.
why does she do this to me?
simply do for her the things she expects from you.
however, eventually, it is not worth lingering so i departed.
no, you should wait until you are older and more knowledgeable about sex.
i noticed the way you notice her and how she acts around you.
just say what's on your mind.
you are looking in all the wrong places.
if only that person was fun to be around.
some people use you to just have sex.
some people want a boyfriend or girlfriend who they can show off and state that said boyfriend or girlfriend is good looking.
can you please restate the question
men may want to have sex with uneducated girls, but they tend to marry smart girls that go to church.
i wish that my problems were as simple as that one.
do you consider yourself open to trying new things?
it's good that you're looking for a partner with great language skills -- maybe you'll learn some spelling tips.
if kissing is considered cheating, i must really be out of touch with things.
you should ask yourself if this person is someone you see yourself spending your life with.

i hope she states yes. that'll be great for you.
tell them what to ask the guy and what to tell him.
give him a hint, smile at him, or something.
i do not honestly believe i loved my boyfriend.
just a guess, but maybe because you think all men are dumb?
just be honest, you will both feel better.
keep trying, don't lose hope.
if he says yes that would be weird because he doesn't know who you are.
i took a big box to her house and hid inside of it for her birthday.

if you want to continue to be with him then  you need to be a better partner.
i wish you well and hope that you find what you are looking for.
he will think about how he feels and will hopefully stop doing the wrong thing.
if other girls show off their things, then he can look all he wants.
just relax and do not worry about it.  you don't need him to call you.

say hell yeah!
it depends on what kind of guy you like.
i'm not interested in guys ten years older than i.

if he continues to bother you, then do not be around him any longer.
if it feels good, then do it.
do not rush, do not start early; you do not need to practice.
maybe you got severely hurt, and don't believe in love anymore.
just try not to push him.

what if she is doing poorly in life?
you should run away if you don't know him.
if not, then you are very lucky. if so, then it is not good.
i have a huge sex drive and my wife does not.
ask them if there is a reason and how should you go about fixing it.
but, i do not see mankind coming together around a camp fire to sing kumbaya anytime soon.
try to see if he notices you. make even a comment like, "excuse me."
it's the only way to be sure.
busting his balls and his friends.
i want to know what they think about mixed marriages.
rain drops are falling on my head.
i think its ok if you date.
enough to see him for what he truly is besides from being attractive.
you are too young to be on here asking for dates.
don't be impolite and expect the girl to always pay.
if he goes out of his way to hang out or talk to you.
yes, but will she stay with him...
do you know how to if you are with the right man?
it is a possibility that they are just friends.
do you think he would be impressed if you have him flowers?
you should let him chase after you!
it is because you are unhappy with yourself
i have three children with three different fathers, and all of them have abandoned us.
you don't need a man to feel like you are important.
it depends on how your relationship is going.
don't inform him that you asked that question.
i have a fear that she will leave if i don't do it.
you do it because it is what you believe in.
i do to but i can not explain it.
if you want to have your fun then fine!
to get attention and sympathy. but i am only guessing.
you could be brave and ask.
it's good if you stay monogamous and use a condom.
i used to think it wasn't a big deal to cheat on your partner.
run away as fast as you can.
ask her if you can call her and hang out at some point.
it depends on your age and whether the two of you have discussed marriage.
he is probably correct so leave him alone.
it tends to cause a lot of problems in our relationship.
i am eight years old and i like tom felton, who is 18, so how should i know?
i suggest that you listen to your heart; it will never lie to you.
if she mentioned that she just wants to be friends, then it's too late.
the reason is that he doesn't sounds very masculine.
i don't think that chris likes mean, drunk girls that hang out with synergypr.
simply tell him you have a boyfriend.
i didn't remember that i had them since i was still thinking like a child.
