Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.
Thanks, good Egeus.
What’s the news with thee?
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius.
My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander.
And my gracious duke, This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchanged love tokens with my child.
What say you, Hermia?
So is Lysander.
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice, The other must be held the worthier.
I would my father looked but with my eyes.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
Either to die the death or to abjure Forever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermia’s.
I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possessed.
My love is more than his.
My fortunes every way as fairly ranked,    as Demetrius'.
And which is more than all these boasts can be  I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena, And won her soul.
With duty and desire we follow you.
How now, my love?
Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
Ay me!
For aught that I could ever read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth.
But either it was different in blood
O cross!
Too high to be enthralled to low.
Or else misgraffèd in respect of years
O spite!
Too old to be engaged to young.
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
If then true lovers have been ever crossed, It stands as an edict in destiny.
A good persuasion.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son.
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke   , In that same place thou hast appointed me, Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
Keep promise, love.
Look, here comes Helena.
Godspeed, fair Helena!
Whither away?
Call you me “fair?” That “fair” again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair.
O happy fair!
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move!
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
None, but your beauty.
Would that fault were mine!
Take comfort.
He no more shall see my face.
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.
Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet.
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow.
Pray thou for us.
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
I will, my Hermia.
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that?
Demetrius thinks not so.
He will not know what all but he do know.
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste   Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
Is all our company here?
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.
Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.
Masters, spread yourselves.
Answer as I call you.
Nick Bottom, the weaver?
Ready.
Name what part I am for and proceed.
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
What is Pyramus?
A lover or a tyrant?
A lover that kills himself, most gallant, for love.
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes.
I will move storms.
I will condole in some measure.
Francis Flute, the bellows mender?
Here, Peter Quince.
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
What is Thisbe?
A wandering knight?
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman.
I have a beard coming.
That’s all one.
You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too!
I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: “Thisne, Thisne!
No, no.
You must play Pyramus.
And Flute, you Thisbe.
Well, proceed.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Here, Peter Quince.
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker?
Here, Peter Quince.
You, Pyramus' father.
Myself, Thisbe’s father.
Snug the joiner, you, the lion’s part.
And I hope here is a play fitted.
Have you the lion’s part written?
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
Let me play the lion too.
I will roar, that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me.
I will roar, that I will make the duke say, “Let him roar again.
Let him roar again.
”
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek.
And that were enough to hang us all.
That would hang us, every mother’s son.
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us.
But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove.
I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.
You can play no part but Pyramus.
For Pyramus is a sweet faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely, gentlemanlike man.
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
Well, I will undertake it.
What beard were I best to play it in?
Why, what you will.
I will discharge it in either your straw color beard, your orange tawny beard, your purple in grain beard, or your French crown color beard, your perfect yellow.
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play barefaced.
But masters, here are your parts.
And I am to entreat you, request you, and desire
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
Take pains.
Be perfect.
At the duke’s oak we meet.
How now, spirit?
Whither wander you?
Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire.
I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon’s sphere.
And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be: In their gold coats spots you see.
Those be rubies, fairy favors.
The king doth keep his revels here tonight.
Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Called Robin Goodfellow.
Thou speak’st aright.
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
And here my mistress.
Would that he were gone!
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
What, jealous Oberon?
Fairies, skip hence.
I have forsworn his bed and company.
Tarry, rash wanton.
Am not I thy lord?
These are the forgeries of jealousy.
Do you amend it then.
It lies in you.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.
Set your heart at rest.
The Fairyland buys not the child of me.
How long within this wood intend you stay?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us.
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
Not for thy fairy kingdom.
Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
Well, go thy way.
Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither.
I remember.
That very time I saw    Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed.
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west, And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.
Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon  Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape  She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
And ere I take this charm from of her sight  As I can take it with another herb  I’ll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here?
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.
And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
You draw me, you hard hearted adamant.
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?
Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel.
And, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
Use me but as your spaniel spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me.
Only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love  And yet a place of high respect with me  Than to be usèd as you use your dog?
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit.
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
And I am sick when I look not on you.
You do impeach your modesty too much, To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not, To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity.
Your virtue is my privilege.
For that It is not night when I do see your face.
Therefore I think I am not in the night.
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world.
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed.
I will not stay thy questions.
Let me go.
Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.
Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
We cannot fight for love as men may do.
We should be wooed and were not made to woo.
Fare thee well, nymph.
Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
Ay, there it is.
I pray thee, give it me.
Fear not, my lord.
Your servant shall do so.
Come now, a roundel and a fairy song.
Philomel, with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby.
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.
Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh.
So good night, with lullaby.
Hence, away!
Now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel.
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.
Love and languish for his sake.
Be it ounce or cat or bear, Pard or boar with bristled hair, In thy eye that shall appear, When thou wakest, it is thy dear.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood.
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way.
Be it so, Lysander.
Find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head.
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both.
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
Nay, good Lysander.
For my sake, my dear, Lie further off yet.
Do not lie so near.
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence.
Lysander riddles very prettily.
Amen, amen to that fair prayer, say I.
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed.
Sleep give thee all his rest!
With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed!
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
O, wilt thou darkling leave me?
Do not so.
Stay, on thy peril.
I alone will go.
Oh, I am out of breath in this fond chase.
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?
Not with salt tears.
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena!
Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius?
Oh, how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
Do not say so, Lysander.
Say not so.
What though he love your Hermia?
Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you.
Then be content.
Content with Hermia?
No.
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love.
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
She sees not Hermia.
Help me, Lysander, help me!
Do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.
Ay me, for pity!
What a dream was here.
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
Methought a serpent eat my heart away, And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
Are we all met?
Pat, pat.
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.
Peter Quince.
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.
By 'r lakin, a parlous fear.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
Not a whit.
I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.
Well.
We will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.
No, make it two more.
Let it be written in eight and eight.
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
I fear it, I promise you.
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves.
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
Good, that’s what we’ll do.
A calendar; we need a calendar!
Why then, may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open, and the moon may shine in at the casement.
You can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?
Some man or other must present Wall.
And let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some roughcast about him to signify wall.
And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
If that may be then all is well.
Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin.
When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.
What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here, So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward?
I’ll be an auditor.
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
Speak, Pyramus.
Thisbe, stand forth.
Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet
“Odors,” “odors.
”
odors savors sweet, So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.
But hark, a voice!
Stay thou but here awhile, And by and by I will to thee appear.
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
Must I speak now?
Ay, marry, must you.
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue, Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse that yet would never tire.
I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.
“Ninus' tomb,” man.
Oh.
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire.
If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine.
Oh, monstrous!
Oh, strange!
We are haunted.
Pray, masters!
Fly, masters!
Help!
I’ll follow you.
I’ll lead you about a round Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier.
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire.
Why do they run away?
This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
What do I see on thee?
What do you see?
You see an ass head of your own, do you?
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee.
Thou art translated.
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends.
Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
Not so, neither.
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
Out of this wood do not desire to go.
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate.
The summer still doth tend upon my state.
And I do love thee.
Therefore go with me.
Ready.
And I.
And I.
And I.
Where shall we go?
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
Hail, mortal.
Hail.
Hail.
Hail.
I cry your worships' mercy, heartily.
I beseech your worship’s name.
Cobweb.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb.
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.
Your name, honest gentleman?
Peaseblossom.
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father.
Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.
Your name, I beseech you, sir?
Mustardseed.
I wonder if Titania be awaked.
Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity.
My mistress with a monster is in love.
This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?
Stand close.
This is the same Athenian.
This is the woman, but not this the man.
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse.
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me.
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?
I’ll believe as soon This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon May through the center creep and so displease Her brother’s noontide with th' Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
What’s this to my Lysander?
Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
Out, dog!
Out, cur!
Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden’s patience.
Hast thou slain him then?
You spend your passion on a misprised mood.
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood.
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so.
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
There is no following her in this fierce vein.
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
What hast thou done?
Thou hast mistaken quite, And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight.
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turned, and not a false turned true.
I go, I go.
Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid’s archery, Sink in apple of his eye.
When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy.
Stand aside.
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.
Then will two at once woo one.
That must needs be sport alone.
And those things do best please me That befall preposterously.
You do advance your cunning more and more.
I had no judgment when to her I swore.
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy.
Oh, how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
O spite!
O hell!
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment.
If you were civil and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury.
You are unkind, Demetrius.
Be not so.
For you love Hermia.
This you know I know.
Lysander, keep thy Hermia.
I will none.
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
Helen, it is not so.
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes.
Yonder is thy dear.
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes.
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
What love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek’st thou me?
Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
You speak not as you think.
It cannot be.
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia!
Most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us oh, is it all forgot?
All schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
I am amazèd at your passionate words.
I scorn you not.
It seems that you scorn me.
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius  Who even but now did spurn me with his foot  To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?
I understand not what you mean by this.
Ay, do.
Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up  This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument.
Stay, gentle Helena.
Hear my excuse.
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
Oh, excellent!
Sweet, do not scorn her so.
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
I say I love thee more than he can do.
If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.
Quick, come.
Lysander, whereto tends all this?
Away, you Ethiope!
No, no.
He’ll Seem to break loose.
Take on as you would follow, But yet come not.
You are a tame man, go!
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr!
Vile thing, let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
Why are you grown so rude?
What change is this, Sweet love?
Thy love?
Out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathèd medicine!
O hated potion, hence!
Do you not jest?
Yes, sooth, and so do you.
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
Ay, by my life, And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.
O me!
Fine, i' faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness?
“Puppet”?
Why so?
Ay, that way goes the game.
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me.
I was never cursed.
I have no gift at all in shrewishness.
I am a right maid for my cowardice.
Let her not strike me.
You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her.
“Lower”?
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
Why, get you gone!
Who is ’t that hinders you?
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
What, with Lysander?
With Demetrius.
Be not afraid.
She shall not harm thee, Helena.
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
Oh, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school.
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
“Little” again?
Nothing but “low” and “little”!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.
Get you gone, you dwarf, You minimus of hindering knotgrass made, You bead, you acorn!
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone.
Speak not of Helena.
Take not her part.
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.
Now she holds me not.
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Nay, go not back.
I am amazed and know not what to say.
This is thy negligence.
Still thou mistakest, Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully.
Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian’s eyes.
And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night.
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste.
But we are spirits of another sort.
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport, And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But notwithstanding, haste.
Make no delay.
We may effect this business yet ere day.
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
I am feared in field and town.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
Speak thou now.
Here, villain.
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then To plainer ground.
Lysander, speak again!
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak!
In some bush?
Where dost thou hide thy head?
Yea, art thou there?
Follow my voice.
He goes before me and still dares me on.
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
Ho, ho, ho!
Coward, why comest thou not?
Abide me, if thou darest!
For well I wot Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place, And darest not stand nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?
Come hither.
I am here.
Nay, then, thou mock’st me.
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see.
Now go thy way.
Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day’s approach look to be visited.
O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours.
Yet but three?
Come one more.
Two of both kinds make up four.
Here she comes, cursed and sad.
Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad.
On the ground Sleep sound.
I'll apply To your eye.
Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy, And stick musk roses in thy sleek, smooth head, And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
Where’s Peaseblossom?
Ready.
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Ready.
Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipped humble bee on the top of a thistle.
And, good monsieur, bring me the honey bag.
Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur.
And good monsieur, have a care the honey bag break not.
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag, signor.
Ready.
Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.
Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.
What’s your will?
Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch.
I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.
And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
I have a reasonable good ear in music.
Let’s have the tongs and the bones.
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
Truly, a peck of provender.
I could munch your good dry oats.
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me.
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
Welcome, good Robin.
Seest thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.
My Oberon, what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamored of an ass.
There lies your love.
How came these things to pass?
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
Silence awhile.
Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call, and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
Music, ho!
Music such as charmeth sleep!
Now when thou wakest, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.
Sound, music!
Fairy King, attend, and mark.
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.
Go, one of you, find out the forester.
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta.
Never did I hear Such gallant chiding.
For, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed all one mutual cry.
I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep.
And this, Lysander.
This Demetrius is.
This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena.
I wonder of their being here together.
No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May, and hearing our intent Came here in grace our solemnity.
It is, my lord.
Good morrow, friends.
Saint Valentine is past.
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?
Pardon, my lord.
I pray you all, stand up.
Enough, enough, my lord.
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood.
And I in fury hither followed them, Fair Helena in fancy following me.
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will.
For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit.
And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far off mountains turnèd into clouds.
Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When everything seems double.
So methinks.
Are you sure That we are awake?
It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream.
Do not you think The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
Yea, and my father.
And Hippolyta.
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
Why then, we are awake.
When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
My next is "Most fair Pyramus.  "
Heigh ho!
Peter Quince?
Flute the bellows mender?
Snout the tinker?
Starveling?
God's my life, stol'n hence, and left me asleep?
I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream  past the wit of man to say what dream it was.
Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.
Methought I was  there is no man can tell what.
Methought I was, and methought I had  but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had.
The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was.
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.
It shall be called "Bottom's Dream" because it hath no bottom.
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke.
Peradventure, to make it more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.
Have you sent to Bottom’s house?
Is he come home yet?
He cannot be heard of.
Out of doubt he is transported.
If he come not, then the play is marred.
It goes not forward.
Doth it?
It is not possible.
You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
Yea, and the best person too.
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
You must say “paragon.
” A “paramour” is, God bless us, a thing of naught.
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.
O sweet bully Bottom!
Where are these lads?
Where are these hearts?
Bottom!
O most courageous day!
O most happy hour!
Masters, I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what, for if I tell you I am no true Athenian.
I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
Not a word of me.
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined.
Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps.
Meet presently at the palace.
Every man look o'er his part.
For the short and the long is, our play is preferred.
In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen.
And let not him that plays the lion pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws.
And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.
And I do not doubt but to hear them say, "It is a sweet comedy.  "
No more words.
Away, go away!
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Joy, gentle friends!
Joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts!
Here, mighty Theseus.
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque, what music?
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?
There is a brief, how many sports are ripe.
Make choice of which your highness will see first.
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play.
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious.
What are they that do play it?
And we will hear it.
No, my noble lord.
It is not for you.
I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world  Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service.
I will hear that play.
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged And duty in his service perishing.
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.
Let him approach.
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think we come not to offend, But with good will.
To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is.
All for your delight We are not here.
This fellow doth not stand upon points.
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt.
He knows not the stop.
A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound, but not in government.
His speech was like a tangled chain.
Nothing impaired, but all disordered.
Who is next?
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know.
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
No wonder, my lord.
In this same interlude it doth befall That I, one Snout by name, present a wall.
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
Pyramus draws near the wall.
Silence!
O grim looked night!
O night with hue so black!
O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night!
No, in truth, sir, he should not.
“Deceiving me” is Thisbe’s cue.
She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall.
You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you.
Yonder she comes.
O Wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones, Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
I see a voice.
Now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
Thisbe?
My love thou art, my love, I think.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
And like Limander am I trusty still.
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
Oh, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so.
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without warning.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men.
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
You, ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
A very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
This lion is a very fox for his valor.
True.
Not so, my lord.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.
It is well.
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
He should have worn the horns on his head.
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.
Myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be.
This is the greatest error of all the rest.
The man should be put into the lanthorn.
How is it else the “man i' th' moon?”
He dares not come there for the candle.
For you see, it is already in snuff.
I am aweary of this moon.
Would he would change!
It appears by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane.
But yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.
Proceed, Moon.
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn, for all these are in the moon.
But silence!
Here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
Where is my love?
O!
Well roared, Lion!
Well run, Thisbe!
Well shone, Moon!
Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.
And then came Pyramus.
And so the lion vanished.
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear, Which is no, no which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer.
Come, tears, confound!
No die, but an ace for him, for he is but one.
Less than an ace, man.
For he is dead.
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
She will find him by starlight.
Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus.
I hope she will be brief.
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better.
He for a man, God warrant us, she for a woman, God bless us.
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
And thus she means , videlice t
Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak.
Quite dumb?
Dead, dead?
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.
Lovers, make moan.
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word.
Come, trusty sword.
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.
And, farewell, friends.
Thus Thisbe ends.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Ay, and Wall too.
No, assure you.
The wall is down that parted their fathers.
Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?
Now the hungry lion roars And the wolf behowls the moon, Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow, Whilst the screech owl, screeching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide, Every one lets forth his sprite, In the churchway paths to glide.
And we fairies, that do run By the triple Hecate’s team From the presence of the sun, Following darkness like a dream, Now are frolic.
Not a mouse Shall disturb this hallowed house.
I am sent with broom before To sweep the dust behind the door.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.
First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place.
If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended   That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream,
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
This young gentlewoman had a father,   O, that 'had'!
how sad a passage 'tis!
How called you the man you speak of, madam?
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
A fistula, my lord.
I heard not of it before.
I would it were not notorious.
Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking.
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.
If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
How understand we that?
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners, as in shape!
He cannot want the best That shall attend his love.
Heaven bless him!
Farewell, Bertram.
The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you!
Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father.
O, were that all!
Save you, fair queen!
And you, monarch!
No.
And no.
Are you meditating on virginity?
Ay.
You have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question.
Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?
Keep him out.
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up!
Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men?
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature.
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
What one, i' faith?
That I wish well.
'Tis pity
What's pity?
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
Under Mars, I.
I especially think, under Mars.
Why under Mars?
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.
When he was predominant.
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
Why think you so?
You go so much backward when you fight.
That's for advantage.
I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee acutely.
So 'tis reported, sir.
His love and wisdom, Approved so to your majesty, may plead For amplest credence.
It well may serve A nursery to our gentry, who are sick For breathing and exploit.
What's he comes here?
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord, Young Bertram.
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
I would I had that corporal soundness now, As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership!
Would I were with him!
I fill a place, I know't.
How long is't, count, Since the physician at your father's died?
He was much famed.
Some six months since, my lord.
If he were living, I would try him yet.
Thank your majesty.
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
What does this knave here?
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
Well, sir.
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
I do beg your good will in this case.
In what case?
In Isbel's case and mine own.
Service is no heritage: and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for they say barnes are blessings.
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
Is this all your worship's reason?
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they are.
May the world know them?
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
Wilt thou ever be a foul mouthed and calumnious knave?
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to speak.
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen, I mean.
What, one good in ten?
you corrupt the song, sirrah.
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
Well, now.
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
What is your pleasure, madam?
You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.
Mine honourable mistress.
Nay, a mother: Why not a mother?
That I am not.
I say, I am your mother.
Nor I your mother?
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter in law: God shield you mean it not!
daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse.
What, pale again?
Good madam, pardon me!
Do you love my son?
Your pardon, noble mistress!
Love you my son?
Do not you love him, madam?
Then, I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son.
Had you not lately an intent,  speak truly,   To go to Paris?
Madam, I had.
Wherefore?
tell true.
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
This was your motive For Paris, was it?
speak.
But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it?
Dost thou believe't?
Ay, madam, knowingly.
'Tis our hope, sir, After well enter'd soldiers, to return And find your grace in health.
Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
Our hearts receive your warnings.
Farewell.
Come hither to me.
O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
'Tis not his fault, the spark.
O, 'tis brave wars!
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
I am commanded here, and kept a coil with 'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.  '
An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.
There's honour in the theft.
Commit it, count.
I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
Farewell, captain.
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.
We shall, noble captain.
Mars dote on you for his novices!
what will ye do?
Stay: the king.
And I will do so.
Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword men.
Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
I'll fee thee to stand up.
Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy, And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
No.
O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
What 'her' is this?
Nay, I'll fit you, And not be all day neither.
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
Nay, come your ways.
This haste hath wings indeed.
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
Ay, my good lord.
I knew him.
The rather will I spare my praises towards him: Knowing him is enough.
On's bed of death Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
My duty then shall pay me for my pains: I will no more enforce mine office on you.
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one, to bear me back again.
What I can do can do no hurt to try, Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
Are thou so confident?
within what space Hopest thou my cure?
Upon thy certainty and confidence What darest thou venture?
Tax of impudence, A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse  if worse  extended With vilest torture let my life be ended.
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak His powerful sound within an organ weak:
If I break time, or flinch in property Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die, And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee; But, if I help, what do you promise me?
Make thy demand.
But will you make it even?
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
To the court!
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks, the pin buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't.
Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
O Lord, sir!
There's a simple putting off.
More, more, a hundred of them.
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
O Lord, sir!
Thick, thick, spare not me.
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
O Lord, sir!
Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
O Lord, sir!
spare not me.
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!  '
at your whipping, and 'spare not me?'
Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!  '
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!  '
I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
I play the noble housewife with the time To entertain't so merrily with a fool.
O Lord, sir!
why, there't serves well again.
An end, sir; to your business.
Not much commendation to them.
Not much employment for you: you understand me?
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
Haste you again.
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.
And so 'tis.
To be relinquish'd of the artists,
So I say.
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.
So I say.
Of all the learned and authentic fellows,
Right; so I say.
That gave him out incurable,
Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
Not to be helped,
Uncertain life, and sure death.
I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me, I speak in respect
Very hand of heaven.
Ay, so I say.
In a most weak  and debile minister, great power, great transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a further
I would have said it; you say well.
Here comes the king.
Mort du vinaigre!
is not this Helen?
'Fore God, I think so.
Go, call before me all the lords in court.
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side; And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive The confirmation of my promised gift, Which but attends thy naming.
Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest, That I protest I simply am a maid.
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, And to imperial Love, that god most high, Do my sighs stream.
Sir, will you hear my suit?
And grant it.
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, Before I speak, too threateningly replies: Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes and her humble love!
No better, if you please.
My wish receive, Which great Love grant!
and so, I take my leave.
Do all they deny her?
An they were sons of mine, I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the Turk, to make eunuchs of.
You are too young, too happy, and too good, To make yourself a son out of my blood.
Fair one, I think not so.
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
My wife, my liege!
I shall beseech your highness, In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes.
Know'st thou not, Bertram, What she has done for me?
Yes, my good lord; But never hope to know why I should marry her.
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising?
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which I can build up.
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad: Let the rest go.
I take her hand.
Do you hear, monsieur?
a word with you.
Your pleasure, sir?
Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
Recantation!
My lord!
my master!
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.
My master!
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if  Lord have mercy on thee for a hen!
So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee.
Give me thy hand.
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
I have not, my lord, deserved it.
Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.
Well, I shall be wiser.
Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the contrary.
If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage.
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord!
Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
Who?
God?
Ay, sir.
The devil it is that's thy master.
Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion?
dost make hose of sleeves?
do other servants so?
Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands.
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
What's the matter, sweet heart?
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn, I will not bed her.
What, what, sweet heart?
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
France is a dog hole, and it no more merits The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!
Ay, that would be known.
To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
He wears his honour in a box unseen, That hugs his kicky wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars's fiery steed.
To other regions France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades; Therefore, to the war!
Will this capriccio hold in thee?
art sure?
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it.
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's not very well?
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
What two things?
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
the other that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
Bless you, my fortunate lady!
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.
Why, I say nothing.
Away!
thou'rt a knave.
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
Did you find me in yourself, sir?
or were you taught to find me?
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
What's his will else?
What more commands he?
That, having this obtain'd, you presently Attend his further pleasure.
In every thing I wait upon his will.
I shall report it so.
I pray you.
Come, sirrah.
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
You have it from his own deliverance.
And by other warranted testimony.
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant.
These things shall be done, sir.
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
Sir?
Is she gone to the king?
She is.
Will she away to night?
As you'll have her.
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, Given order for our horses; and to night, When I should take possession of the bride, End ere I do begin.
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's prayers.
An idle lord.
I think so.
Why, do you not know him?
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech Gives him a worthy pass.
Here comes my clog.
I shall obey his will.
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so I leave you to your wisdom.
Sir, I can nothing say, But that I am your most obedient servant.
Come, come, no more of that.
And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd To equal my great fortune.
Pray, sir, your pardon.
Well, what would you say?
What would you have?
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
Where are my other men, monsieur?
Farewell.
Go thou toward home; where I will never come Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.
Bravely, coragio!
Holy seems the quarrel Upon your grace's part; black and fearful On the opposer.
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France Would in so just a business shut his bosom Against our borrowing prayers.
Be it his pleasure.
But I am sure the younger of our nature, That surfeit on their ease, will day by day Come here for physic.
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her.
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.
By what observance, I pray you?
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing.
I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
What have we here?
E'en that you have there.
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady!
What is the matter?
Why should he be killed?
Save you, good madam.
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
Do not say so.
Think upon patience.
Pray you, gentlemen, I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief, That the first face of neither, on the start, Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.  '
This is a dreadful sentence.
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
Ay, madam.
And to be a soldier?
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't, The duke will lay upon him all the honour That good convenience claims.
Return you thither?
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
'Tis bitter.
Find you that there?
Ay, madam.
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his heart was not consenting to.
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
A servant only, and a gentleman Which I have sometime known.
Parolles, was it not?
Ay, my good lady, he.
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well derived nature With his inducement.
You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son, To tell him that his sword can never win The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you Written to bear along.
We serve you, madam, In that and all your worthiest affairs.
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.  '
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France; Then hast thou all again.
Poor lord!
Sir, it is A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake To the extreme edge of hazard.
Alas!
and would you take the letter of her?
Might you not know she would do as she has done, By sending me a letter?
Read it again.
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband?
he cannot thrive, Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice.
Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight.
They say the French count has done most honourable service.
It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander; and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother.
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it.
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.
I know that knave; hang him!
You shall not need to fear me.
I hope so.
To Saint Jaques le Grand.
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
Is this the way?
Ay, marry, is't.
Hark you!
they come this way.
Is it yourself?
If you shall please so, pilgrim.
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
You came, I think, from France?
I did so.
Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service.
His name, I pray you.
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
Whatsome'er he is, He's bravely taken here.
He stole from France, As 'tis reported, for the king had married him Against his liking: think you it is so?
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her.
What's his name?
Monsieur Parolles.
Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord.
How do you mean?
May be the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose.
The gods forbid else!
So, now they come:
That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son; That, Escalus.
Which is the Frenchman?
I like him well.
Which is he?
That jack an apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
Lose our drum!
well.
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
Marry, hang you!
And your courtesy, for a ring carrier!
The troop is past.
We'll take your offer kindly.
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.
On my life, my lord, a bubble.
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
How now, monsieur!
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.
A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
'But a drum'!
is't 'but a drum'?
A drum so lost!
There was excellent command,  to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
It might have been recovered.
It might; but it is not now.
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
But you must not now slumber in it.
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
I know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt I vow.
I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee.
Farewell.
I love not many words.
No more than a fish loves water.
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
Your brother he shall go along with me.
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you The lass I spoke of.
But you say she's honest.
With all my heart, my lord.
If you misdoubt me that I am not she, I know not how I shall assure you further, But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
Nor would I wish you.
I should believe you: For you have show'd me that which well approves You're great in fortune.
Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which I will over pay and pay again When I have found it.
Now I see The bottom of your purpose.
He can come no other way but by this hedge corner.
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
Art not acquainted with him?
knows he not thy voice?
No, sir, I warrant you.
But what linsey woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
E'en such as you speak to me.
He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment.
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.
What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose?
Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
We cannot afford you so.
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem.
'Twould not do.
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
Hardly serve.
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
How deep?
Thirty fathom.
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear I recovered it.
You shall hear one anon.
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
O, ransom, ransom!
do not hide mine eyes.
Boskos thromuldo boskos.
O!
O, pray, pray, pray!
Manka revania dulche.
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
O, let me live!
But wilt thou faithfully?
If I do not, damn me.
Acordo linta.
Come on; thou art granted space.
Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother, We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them.
Captain, I will.
A' will betray us all unto ourselves: Inform on that.
So I will, sir.
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
They told me that your name was Fontibell.
No, my good lord, Diana.
Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition!
But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality?
She then was honest.
So should you be.
How have I sworn!
I see that men make ropes in such a snare That we'll forsake ourselves.
Give me that ring.
I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power To give it from me.
Will you not, my lord?
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end.
You have not given him his mother's letter?
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him.
I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it.
Now, God delay our rebellion!
as we are ourselves, what things are we!
Merely our own traitors.
Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents?
We shall not then have his company to night?
In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
I hear there is an overture of peace.
Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
What will Count Rousillon do then?
will he travel higher, or return again into France?
I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.
How is this justified?
Hath the count all this intelligence?
Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity.
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears!
The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.
How now!
where's your master?
They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Here's his lordship now.
How now, my lord!
is't not after midnight?
If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter.
But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier?
Come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double meaning prophesier.
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long.
How does he carry himself?
I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him.
Nothing of me, has a'?
A plague upon him!
muffled!
he can say nothing of me: hush, hush!
Hoodman comes!
Portotartarosa
He calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em?
Bosko chimurcho.
Boblibindo chicurmurco.
You are a merciful general.
Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
And truly, as I hope to live.
'First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.  '
What say you to that?
Shall I set down your answer so?
All's one to him.
What a past saving slave is this!
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean.
Nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly.
Well, that's set down.
Five or six thousand horse, I said,   I will say true,  or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
He's very near the truth in this.
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it.
Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
Well, that's set down.
'Demand of him, of what strength they are a foot.  '
What say you to that?
By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true.
What shall be done to him?
Nothing, but let him have thanks.
Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
Well, that's set down.
I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
Do you know this Captain Dumain?
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
What is his reputation with the duke?
Marry, we'll search.
I do not know if it be it or no.
Our interpreter does it well.
Excellently.
'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
Damnable both sides rogue!
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead.
This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.
I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.
I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you.
I begin to love him for this.
For this description of thine honesty?
A pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat.
What say you to his expertness in war?
He hath out villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him.
A pox on him, he's a cat still.
His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
Why does he ask him of me?
What's he?
If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
I'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums!
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
So, look about you: know you any here?
Good morrow, noble captain.
God bless you, Captain Parolles.
God save you, noble captain.
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
I am for France.
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you: but fare you well.
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on't yet
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation.
Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome.
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose herbs.
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
Your distinction?
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
At your service.
No, no, no.
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.
Who's that?
a Frenchman?
Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy is more hotter in France than there.
What prince is that?
If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
So he is.
I like him well; 'tis not amiss.
With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected.
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I thank my God it holds yet.
A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is that.
But it is your carbonadoed face.
Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
This man may help me to his majesty's ear, If he would spend his power.
God save you, sir.
And you.
Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
I have been sometimes there.
What's your will?
That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king, And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence.
The king's not here.
Not here, sir!
Lord, how we lose our pains!
All's well that ends well yet, Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon; Whither I am going.
This I'll do for you.
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd, Whate'er falls more.
We must to horse again.
Go, go, provide.
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by a metaphor.
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor.
Prithee, get thee further.
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
Foh!
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.
And what would you have me to do?
'Tis too late to pare her nails now.
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't; save your word.
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
You beg more than 'word,' then.
Cox my passion!
give me your hand.
How does your drum?
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!
Was I, in sooth?
and I was the first that lost thee.
Out upon thee, knave!
dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil?
One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out.
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets.
I praise God for you.
My honour'd lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all; Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch'd the time to shoot.
Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear.
I shall, my liege.
What says he to your daughter?
have you spoke?
All that he is hath reference to your highness.
Then shall we have a match.
I have letters sent me That set him high in fame.
He looks well on't.
My high repented blames, Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
Hers it was not.
My gracious sovereign, Howe'er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers.
I am sure I saw her wear it.
Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in nature's mystery more science Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's, Whoever gave it you.
She never saw it.
If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, Where yet she never was.
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me.
I will buy me a son in law in a fair, and toll for this: I'll none of him.
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu, To bring forth this discovery.
Seek these suitors: Go speedily and bring again the count.
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, Was foully snatch'd.
Now, justice on the doers!
What woman's that?
Come hither, count; do you know these women?
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
She's none of mine, my lord.
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.
Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity.
What say'st thou to her?
She's impudent, my lord, And was a common gamester to the camp.
Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it.
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
I saw the man to day, if man he be.
Find him, and bring him hither.
What of him?
She hath that ring of yours.
I have it not.
What ring was yours, I pray you?
Sir, much like The same upon your finger.
Know you this ring?
this ring was his of late.
And this was it I gave him, being abed.
I have spoke the truth.
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
Is this the man you speak of?
Ay, my lord.
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
How, I pray you?
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
How is that?
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
As thou art a knave, and no knave.
What an equivocal companion is this!
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
Do you know he promised me marriage?
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
Yes, so please your majesty.
Ay, my good lord.
Where did you buy it?
or who gave it you?
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
Who lent it you?
It was not lent me neither.
Where did you find it, then?
I found it not.
If it were yours by none of all these ways, How could you give it him?
I never gave it him.
This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
I'll never tell you.
Take her away.
I'll put in bail, my liege.
I think thee now some common customer.
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
Good mother, fetch my bail.
Stay, royal sir:
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me.
Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is't real that I see?
Both, both.
O, pardon!
O my good lord, when I was like this maid, I found you wondrous kind.
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
If it appear not plain and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you!
O my dear mother, do I see you living?
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
Let us from point to point this story know, To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure.
Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front.
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
News, my good lord, from Rome.
Grates me, the sum.
Nay, hear them, Antony.
Fulvia perchance is angry.
How, my love?
Perchance?
Nay, and most like.
You must not stay here longer.
Your dismission Is come from Caesar.
Therefore hear it, Antony.
Where’s Fulvia’s process?
Caesar’s, I would say both?
Call in the messengers.
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.
Else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill tongued Fulvia scolds.
The messengers!
Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall.
Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay.
Our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man.
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I’ll seem the fool I am not.
Antony Will be himself.
But stirred by Cleopatra.
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh.
There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now.
What sport tonight?
Hear the ambassadors.
Fie, wrangling Queen!
Whom every thing becomes to chide, to laugh, To weep, whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people.
Come, my Queen, Last night you did desire it.
Speak not to us.
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony.
I am full sorry That he approves the common liar, who Thus speaks of him at Rome, but I will hope Of better deeds tomorrow.
Rest you happy!
Soothsayer!
Your will?
Is this the man?
Is ’t you, sir, that know things?
In nature’s infinite book of secrecy A little I can read.
Show him your hand.
Bring in the banquet quickly.
Wine enough Cleopatra’s health to drink.
Good sir, give me good fortune.
Pray, then, foresee me one.
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
He means in flesh.
No, you shall paint when you are old.
Wrinkles forbid!
Vex not his prescience.
Be attentive.
Hush!
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
Nay, hear him.
Good now, some excellent fortune!
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
Oh, excellent!
I love long life better than figs.
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach.
Then belike my children shall have no names.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
If every of your wishes had a womb, And fertile every wish, a million.
Out, fool!
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
We’ll know all our fortunes.
Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to bed.
There’s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.
Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune.
Your fortunes are alike.
But how, but how?
Give me particulars.
I have said.
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
Not in my husband’s nose.
Our worser thoughts heavens mend.
Alexas!
Come, his fortune, his fortune!
Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded.
Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly.
Amen.
Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they’d do ’t.
Hush!
Here comes Antony.
Not he.
The Queen.
Saw you my lord?
No, lady.
Was he not here?
No, madam.
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him.
Enobarbus!
Madam?
Seek him and bring him hither.
Where’s Alexas?
Here at your service.
My lord approaches.
We will not look upon him.
Go with us.
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
Against my brother Lucius?
Well, what worst?
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
When it concerns the fool or coward.
On.
Things that are past are done, with me.
“Antony,” thou wouldst say.
O my lord!
Speak to me home.
Mince not the general tongue.
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome.
Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase, and taunt my faults With such full license as both truth and malice Have power to utter.
At your noble pleasure.
From Sicyon, how, the news?
Speak there.
The man from Sicyon
Is there such an one?
He stays upon your will.
Let him appear.
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
Where died she?
In Sicyon.
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.
Forbear me.
What’s your pleasure, sir?
I must with haste from hence.
Why, then, we kill all our women.
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them.
If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.
I must be gone.
Under a compelling occasion, let women die.
She is cunning past man’s thought.
Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love.
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears.
They are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report.
This cannot be cunning in her.
If it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
Would I had never seen her!
O sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
Fulvia is dead.
Sir?
Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia?
Dead.
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out,
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.
No more light answers.
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose.
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part.
I shall do ’t.
Where is he?
I did not see him since.
See where he is, who’s with him, what he does.
I did not send you.
If you find him sad, Say I am dancing.
If in mirth, report That I am sudden sick.
Quick, and return.
What should I do I do not?
In each thing give him way.
Cross him in nothing.
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him.
Tempt him not so too far.
I wish, forbear.
I am sick and sullen.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
Help me away, dear Charmian!
I shall fall.
It cannot be thus long.
The sides of nature Will not sustain it.
Now, my dearest Queen
Pray you, stand farther from me.
What’s the matter?
I know by that same eye there’s some good news.
What, says the married woman you may go?
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.
I have no power upon you.
Hers you are.
The gods best know
Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed!
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
Cleopatra
Most sweet Queen
Nay, pray you, seek no color for your going, But bid farewell and go.
How now, lady?
I would I had thy inches.
She’s dead, my Queen.
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?
Now I see, I see, In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.
Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know The purposes I bear, which are or cease As you shall give th’ advice.
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
But let it be.
I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.
My precious Queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial.
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.
You’ll heat my blood.
No more.
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
Now, by my sword
And target.
Still he mends.
But this is not the best.
Look, prithee, Charmian, How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe.
I’ll leave you, lady.
Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it.
Sir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it, That you know well.
But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself.
’Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this.
But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you.
Your honor calls you hence.
Let us go.
Come.
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know, It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate Our great competitor.
I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness.
You are too indulgent.
Here’s more news.
Thy biddings have been done, and every hour, Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report How ’tis abroad.
I should have known no less.
Caesar, I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind.
Many hot inroads They make in Italy the borders maritime Lack blood to think on ’t and flush youth revolt.
Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails.
’Tis pity of him.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time.
Till which encounter It is my business too.
Farewell.
Farewell, my lord.
What you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir, To let me be partaker.
Doubt not, sir.
I knew it for my bond.
Charmian!
Madam?
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.
Why, madam?
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away.
You think of him too much.
Oh, ’tis treason!
Madam, I trust, not so.
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
What’s your highness’ pleasure?
Not now to hear thee sing.
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has.
’Tis well for thee That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt.
Hast thou affections?
Yes, gracious madam.
Indeed?
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done.
Yet have I fierce affections, and think What Venus did with Mars.
O Charmian, Where think’st thou he is now?
Stands he or sits he?
Or does he walk?
Or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse, for wott’st thou whom thou mov’st?
The demi Atlas of this earth, the arm And burgonet of men.
He’s speaking now, Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?” For so he calls me.
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison.
Think on me, That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time.
Broad fronted Caesar, When thou wast here above the ground, I was A morsel for a monarch.
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed the last of many doubled kisses  This orient pearl.
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
What was he, sad or merry?
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
O well divided disposition!
Note him, Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man, but note him.
He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his.
He was not merry, Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both.
O heavenly mingle!
Be’st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else.
Mett’st thou my posts?
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar.
Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so?
Oh, that brave Caesar!
Be choked with such another emphasis!
Say, “the brave Antony.
The valiant Caesar!
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men.
By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you.
If the great gods be just, they shall assist The deeds of justest men.
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays The thing we sue for.
We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good, so find we profit By losing of our prayers.
I shall do well.
The people love me, and the sea is mine.
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full.
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors.
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts.
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field.
A mighty strength they carry.
Where have you this?
’Tis false.
From Silvius, sir.
He dreams.
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony.
But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming.
Epicurean cooks, Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite, That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor Even till a Lethe’d dulness
I could have given less matter A better ear.
Menas, I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm For such a petty war.
His soldiership Is twice the other twain.
But let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust wearied Antony.
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Were ’t not that we stand up against them all, ’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves, For they have entertainèd cause enough To draw their swords.
But how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference, we yet not know.
Be ’t as our gods will have ’t.
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Come, Menas.
Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech.
I shall entreat him To answer like himself.
If Caesar move him, Let Antony look over Caesar’s head And speak as loud as Mars.
By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard, I would not shave ’t today.
’Tis not a time for private stomaching.
Every time serves for the matter that is then born in ’t.
Not if the small come first.
Your speech is passion.
But pray you stir No embers up.
Here comes the noble Antony.
And yonder, Caesar.
If we compose well here, to Parthia.
Hark, Ventidius.
I do not know, Maecenas.
Ask Agrippa.
Noble friends, That which combined us was most great, and let not A leaner action rend us.
What’s amiss, May it be gently heard.
When we debate Our trivial difference loud, we do commit Murder in healing wounds.
Then, noble partners, The rather for I earnestly beseech, Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms, Nor curstness grow to th’ matter.
’Tis spoken well.
Welcome to Rome.
Thank you.
Sit.
Sit, sir.
Nay, then.
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt.
Yet if you there Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question.
How intend you, “practiced”?
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me.
Your wife and brother Made wars upon me, and their contestation Was theme for you.
You were the word of war.
You do mistake your business.
My brother never Did urge me in his act.
I did inquire it, And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you.
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.
Not so, not so.
I know you could not lack, I am certain on ’t, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace.
As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another.
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria.
You Did pocket up my letters and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience.
You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.
Soft, Caesar.
No, Lepidus, let him speak.
The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.
But, on, Caesar.
The article of my oath?
To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.
’Tis noble spoken.
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye, to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you.
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
Thou art a soldier only.
Speak no more.
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
You wrong this presence.
Therefore speak no more.
Go to, then.
Your considerate stone.
Give me leave, Caesar.
Speak, Agrippa.
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side, Admired Octavia.
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.
Say not so, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.
I am not married, Caesar.
Let me hear Agrippa further speak.
Will Caesar speak?
Not till he hears how Antony is touched With what is spoke already.
What power is in Agrippa If I would say, “Agrippa, be it so,” To make this good?
The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia.
May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment!
Let me have thy hand Further this act of grace, and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs!
There’s my hand.
Happily, amen!
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey, For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me.
Time calls upon ’s.
Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us.
Where lies he?
About the Mount Misena.
What is his strength by land?
Great and increasing.
But by sea he is an absolute master.
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together!
Haste we for it.
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we The business we have talked of.
Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.
Welcome from Egypt, sir.
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas!
My honorable friend, Agrippa.
Good Enobarbus!
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.
You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.
Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there!
Is this true?
This was but as a fly by an eagle.
We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
She’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.
I will tell you.
Oh, rare for Antony!
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes, And made their bends adornings.
At the helm A seeming mermaid steers.
The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower soft hands That yarely frame the office.
From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs.
Rare Egyptian!
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper.
She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated.
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
He plowed her, and she cropped.
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
Never.
He will not.
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle The heart of Antony, Octavia is A blessèd lottery to him.
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here.
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom.
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.
Good night, sir.
My Octavia, Read not my blemishes in the world’s report.
I have not kept my square, but that to come Shall all be done by th’ rule.
Good night, dear lady.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.
If you can, your reason?
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue.
But yet hie you to Egypt again.
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?
Caesar’s.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
Thy dæmon that thy spirit which keeps thee is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not.
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered.
Therefore Make space enough between you.
Speak this no more.
Get thee gone.
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
Trouble yourselves no further.
Pray you, hasten Your generals after.
Sir, Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.
Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress, Which will become you both, farewell.
We shall, As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount Before you, Lepidus.
Your way is shorter.
My purposes do draw me much about.
You’ll win two days upon me.
Farewell.
Give me some music.
Music, moody food Of us that trade in love.
The music, ho!
Let it alone.
Let’s to billiards.
Come, Charmian.
My arm is sore.
Best play with Mardian.
As well a woman with an eunuch played As with a woman.
Come, you’ll play with me, sir?
As well as I can, madam.
And when good will is showed, though ’t come too short, The actor may plead pardon.
I’ll none now.
Give me mine angle.
We’ll to th’ river.
There, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny finned fishes.
My bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up I’ll think them every one an Antony And say, “Aha!
You’re caught.
That time Oh, times!
I laughed him out of patience, and that night I laughed him into patience.
And next morn, Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed, Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst I wore his sword Philippan.
Madam, madam
Antonio’s dead!
If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress.
First, madam, he is well.
Why, there’s more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well.
Good madam, hear me.
Well, go to, I will.
But there’s no goodness in thy face if Antony Be free and healthful, so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings!
If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes, Not like a formal man.
Will ’t please you hear me?
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.
Madam, he’s well.
Well said.
And friends with Caesar.
Th’ art an honest man.
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
Make thee a fortune from me.
But yet, madam
I do not like “But yet.
” It does allay The good precedence.
Fie upon “But yet.
” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor.
Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together.
He’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free.
Free, madam, no.
I made no such report.
He’s bound unto Octavia.
For what good turn?
For the best turn i’ th’ bed.
I am pale, Charmian.
Madam, he’s married to Octavia.
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
Good madam, patience.
What say you?
Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match.
Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud.
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg.
He’s married, madam.
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
Nay then, I’ll run.
What mean you, madam?
I have made no fault.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.
The man is innocent.
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents.
Call the slave again.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him.
Call!
He is afeard to come.
I will not hurt him.
I have done my duty.
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do If thou again say “yes.
He’s married, madam.
The gods confound thee!
Dost thou hold there still?
Should I lie, madam?
I crave your highness’ pardon.
He is married?
Take no offense that I would not offend you.
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal.
He’s married to Octavia.
Good your highness, patience.
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
Many times, madam.
I am paid for ’t now.
Lead me from hence.
I faint.
O Iras, Charmian!
’Tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas.
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia: her years, Her inclination.
Let him not leave out The color of her hair.
Bring me word quickly.
Your hostages I have, so have you mine, And we shall talk before we fight.
To you all three, The senators alone of this great world, Chief factors for the gods: I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want, Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar, Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, There saw you laboring for him.
Take your time.
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.
We’ll speak with thee at sea.
At land, thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.
Be pleased to tell us  For this is from the present how you take The offers we have sent you.
There’s the point.
You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia.
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer, but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience.
Though I lose The praise of it by telling, you must know, When Caesar and your brother were at blows, Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly.
I have heard it, Pompey, And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you.
Let me have your hand.
The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you, That called me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gained by ’t.
Since I saw you last There’s a change upon you.
Well, I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face, But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal.
Well met here.
I hope so, Lepidus.
Thus we are agreed.
I crave our composition may be written And sealed between us.
That’s the next to do.
That will I, Pompey.
No, Antony, take the lot.
You have heard much.
I have fair meanings, sir.
And fair words to them.
Then so much have I heard.
And I have heard Apollodorus carried
No more of that.
He did so.
What, I pray you?
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
I know thee now.
How far’st thou, soldier?
Well, And well am like to do, for I perceive, Four feasts are toward.
Let me shake thy hand.
I never hated thee.
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior.
Sir, I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did.
Enjoy thy plainness.
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all.
Will you lead, lords?
Come.
Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.
You and I have known, sir.
At sea, I think.
We have, sir.
You have done well by water.
And you by land.
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
Nor what I have done by water.
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
And you by land.
There I deny my land service.
But give me your hand, Menas.
All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
No slander.
They steal hearts.
We came hither to fight with you.
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.
You’ve said, sir.
We looked not for Mark Antony here.
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.
True, sir.
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
Pray ye, sir?
’Tis true.
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
I think so too.
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity.
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
Who would not have his wife so?
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again.
And thus it may be.
Come, sir, will you aboard?
I have a health for you.
I shall take it, sir.
We have used our throats in Egypt.
Come, let’s away.
Here they’ll be, man.
Some o’ their plants are ill rooted already.
The least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down.
Lepidus is high colored.
They have made him drink alms drink.
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out, “No more,” reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink.
But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
Why, this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship.
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in ’t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
You’ve strange serpents there?
Ay, Lepidus.
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun.
So is your crocodile.
They are so.
Sit, and some wine.
A health to Lepidus!
I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.
Not till you have slept.
I fear me you’ll be in till then.
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things.
Without contradiction I have heard that.
Pompey, a word.
Say in mine ear.
What is ’t?
Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain, And hear me speak a word.
Forbear me till anon.
This wine for Lepidus!
What manner o’ thing is your crocodile?
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.
It is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs.
It lives by that which nourisheth it, and, the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
What color is it of?
Of it own color too.
’Tis a strange serpent.
’Tis so.
And the tears of it are wet.
Will this description satisfy him?
Go hang, sir, hang!
Tell me of that?
Away!
Do as I bid you.
Where’s this cup I called for?
If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me, Rise from thy stool.
I think th’ art mad.
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
Thou hast served me with much faith.
What’s else to say?
Be jolly, lords.
These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
What sayst thou?
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world?
That’s twice.
How should that be?
Hast thou drunk well?
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar’st be, the earthly Jove.
Whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips Is thine, if thou wilt ha ’t.
Show me which way.
These three world sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel.
Let me cut the cable, And, when we are put off, fall to their throats.
All there is thine.
Ah, this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t!
For this, I’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more.
Who seeks and will not take when once ’tis offered Shall never find it more.
This health to Lepidus!
Bear him ashore.
I’ll pledge it for him, Pompey.
Here’s to thee, Menas!
Enobarbus, welcome.
Fill till the cup be hid.
There’s a strong fellow, Menas.
Why?
He bears The third part of the world, man.
Seest not?
The third part, then, is drunk.
Would it were all, That it might go on wheels!
Drink thou.
Increase the reels.
Come.
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
It ripens towards it.
Strike the vessels, ho!
Here’s to Caesar.
I could well forbear ’t.
It’s monstrous labor when I wash my brain And it grows fouler.
Be a child o’ th’ time.
Possess it, I’ll make answer.
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one.
Ha!
My brave emperor, Shall we dance now the Egyptian bacchanals And celebrate our drink?
Let’s ha ’t, good soldier.
Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.
All take hands.
Come, thou monarch of the vine, Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
What would you more?
Pompey, good night.
Good brother, Let me request you off.
Our graver business Frowns at this levity.
Gentle lords, let’s part.
You see we have burnt our cheeks.
Strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks.
The wild disguise hath almost Anticked us all.
What needs more words?
Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.
I’ll try you on the shore.
And shall, sir.
Give ’s your hand.
O Antony, You have my father’s house.
But what?
We are friends.
Come, down into the boat.
Take heed you fall not.
No, to my cabin.
These drums, these trumpets, flutes!
Hoo!
says ’a.
Hoo!
Noble captain, come.
Noble Ventidius, Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm, The fugitive Parthians follow.
Spur through Media, Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither The routed fly.
So thy grand captain, Antony, Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head.
O Silius, Silius, I have done enough.
A lower place, note well, May make too great an act.
For learn this, Silius: Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person.
Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction.
Thou wilt write to Antony?
Where is he now?
He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste The weight we must convey with’s will permit, We shall appear before him.
On, there.
Pass along!
What, are the brothers parted?
They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.
The other three are sealing.
Octavia weeps To part from Rome.
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.
’Tis a noble Lepidus.
A very fine one.
Oh, how he loves Caesar!
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
Caesar?
Why, he’s the Jupiter of men.
What’s Antony?
The god of Jupiter.
Spake you of Caesar?
How, the nonpareil!
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!
Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar.
” Go no further.
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony.
Hoo!
Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number hoo!
His love to Antony.
Both he loves.
They are his shards, and he their beetle.
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
No further, sir.
You take from me a great part of myself; Use me well in ’t.
Make me not offended In your distrust.
I have said.
You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least cause For what you seem to fear.
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.
We will here part.
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort!
Fare thee well.
My noble brother!
Sir, look well to my husband’s house, and
What, Octavia?
I’ll tell you in your ear.
Will Caesar weep?
He has a cloud in ’s face.
He were the worse for that, were he a horse; So is he, being a man.
Why, Enobarbus, When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, He cried almost to roaring, and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
That year indeed he was troubled with a rheum.
No, sweet Octavia, You shall hear from me still.
The time shall not Outgo my thinking on you.
Come, sir, come, I’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
Look, here I have you.
Adieu.
Be happy.
Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way.
Farewell, farewell.
Farewell.
Where is the fellow?
Half afeard to come.
Go to, go to.
Come hither, sir.
Good majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased.
That Herod’s head I’ll have!
But how?
When Antony is gone, Through whom I might command it?
Come thou near.
Most gracious majesty!
Didst thou behold Octavia?
Ay, dread Queen.
Where?
Madam, in Rome.
I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as me?
She is not, madam.
Didst hear her speak?
Is she shrill tongued or low?
Madam, I heard her speak.
She is low voiced.
That’s not so good.
He cannot like her long.
Like her?
O Isis, ’tis impossible.
I think so, Charmian.
She creeps.
Her motion and her station are as one.
She shows a body rather than a life, A statue than a breather.
Is this certain?
Or I have no observance.
Three in Egypt Cannot make better note.
He’s very knowing, I do perceive ’t.
There’s nothing in her yet.
The fellow has good judgment.
Excellent.
Guess at her years, I prithee.
Madam, she was a widow
Widow?
Charmian, hark.
And I do think she’s thirty.
Bear’st thou her face in mind?
Is ’t long or round?
Round, even to faultiness.
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what color?
Brown, madam, and her forehead As low as she would wish it.
There’s gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business.
Go make thee ready; Our letters are prepared.
A proper man.
Indeed, he is so.
I repent me much That so I harried him.
Nothing, madam.
Hath he seen majesty?
Isis else defend, And serving you so long!
I warrant you, madam.
Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it.
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, Your reconciler!
How now, friend Eros!
There’s strange news come, sir.
What, man?
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
This is old.
What is the success?
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him.
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast, They’ll grind the one the other.
Where’s Antony?
Our great navy’s rigged.
For Italy and Caesar.
More, Domitius: My lord desires you presently.
my lord wants to see you immediately.
I should have told you my news afterwards.
It doesn't matter, never mind.
Anthony condemned Rome, and that's not all.
He did this in public?
In the public arena, where people play sports.
Let the people in Rome know this.
The Romans are already indignant at his disrespectful behavior and will stop thinking well of him.
Sir, some answer should be made to these accusations.
He'll never agree to that.
Then I should not agree to his terms.
Enter OCTAVIA with her train OCTAVIA enters with her followers.
Hail, Caesar, my lord!
Oh what a pity that I should ever call you a castaway !
You haven't called me one, and you have no reason to.
In Athens, my lord.
You're welcome here.
Welcome, lady.
Welcome, dear madam.
Is that true, sir?
Well, is it appropriate, is it?
To hell with Rome!
And let them rot, those who criticize us!
By sea, how else would we do it?
Why do you want to do that?
Because he dares us to.
And my lord Antony has also challenged Caesar to single combat.
Yes, and also to fight this battle at Pharsalia, where Caesar fought with Pompey.
But these offers aren't to Caesar's advantage and he rejects them, and so should you.
Your ships aren't manned by good sailors.
I'll fight at sea.
The news is true, my lord.
He has been spotted.
How can he be there?
Oh noble Emperor, don't fight at sea!
Well, well, away.
I swear by Hercules, I think I am right.
Soldier, you are, but he makes all his plans without considering what he has the power to accomplish.
You still have the entirety of the legions and the horses in reserve, don't you?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius are heading to sea, but our forces are kept together in reserve on land.
Have you heard who his lieutenant is?
They say a certain man named Taurus.
I know the man well.
The Emperor has sent for Canidius.
Taurus!
My lord?
Lost, lost, all is lost!
By the whole assembly of the gods and goddesses!
How is the battle going?
Ah, are you thinking that too?
It's easy to get there, and I'll wait there to see what comes next.
He exits SCARUS exits.
I will offer my legions and my horses to Caesar's service.
No, gentle madam, go to him, comfort him.
Do, dearest Queen.
Do.
Why, what else would you do?
Let me sit down.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do you see this woman here, sir?
Oh, shame on you, shame, shame, shame!
Madam!
Madam, Oh good Empress!
Sir, sir
Yes, my lord, yes.
Ah, stand aside.
The Queen, my lord, look at the Queen.
Go to him, Madam, speak to him.
Well then, support me.
Oh!
Most noble sir, get up.
Sir, the Queen.
Oh, what have you led me to do, Queen of Egypt?
Forgive me, forgive me!
Don't cry one tear, I say.
Caesar, it's his children's tutor.
Come forward and speak.
For Antony, I will not listen to his requests.
May you have good fortune!
Escort him through the ranks of soldiers.
Caesar, I go.
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves.
Caesar, I shall.
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
Think and die.
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason.
What though you fled From that great face of war, whose several ranges Frighted each other?
Why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed, he being The merèd question.
’Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.
Prithee, peace.
Is that his answer?
Ay, my lord.
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up?
He says so.
Let her know ’t.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities.
That head, my lord?
To him again.
Tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him, from which the world should note Something particular.
A messenger from Caesar.
What, no more ceremony?
Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly.
Caesar’s will?
Hear it apart.
None but friends.
Say boldly.
So haply are they friends to Antony.
So.
Go on.
Right royal.
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.
Oh!
He is a god and knows What is most right.
Mine honor was not yielded, But conquered merely.
To be sure of that, I will ask Antony.
Sir, sir, thou art so leaky That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for Thy dearest quit thee.
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him?
For he partly begs To be desired to give.
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon.
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.
What’s your name?
My name is Thidias.
Most kind messenger, Say to great Caesar this in deputation: I kiss his conqu’ring hand.
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.
Tell him, from his all obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt.
’Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together, If that the former dare but what it can, No chance may shake it.
Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand.
Your Caesar’s father oft, When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in, Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place As it rained kisses.
Favors?
By Jove that thunders!
What art thou, fellow?
One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest To have command obeyed.
You will be whipped.
Approach, there!
Ah, you kite!
Now, gods and devils!
Authority melts from me.
Of late, when I cried “Ho!
” Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth And cry, “Your will?”    Have you no ears?
I am Antony yet.
Moon and stars!
Whip him.
Mark Antony
Tug him away!
Being whipped, Bring him again.
Good my lord
You have been a boggler ever.
But when we in our viciousness grow hard  Oh, misery on ’t!
the wise gods seel our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion.
Oh, is ’t come to this?
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher.
Wherefore is this?
To let a fellow that will take rewards And say “God quit you!
Soundly, my lord.
Cried he?
And begged he pardon?
He did ask favor.
Have you done yet?
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.
I must stay his time.
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?
Not know me yet?
Coldhearted toward me?
Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, And poison it in the source, and the first stone Drop in my neck.
As it determines, so Dissolve my life!
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!
I am satisfied.
That’s my brave lord!
I will be treble sinewed,  hearted,  breathed, And fight maliciously.
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives Of me for jests; but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me.
Come, Let’s have one other gaudy night.
Call to me All my sad captains.
Fill our bowls once more.
Let’s mock the midnight bell.
It is my birthday.
I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lord Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
We will yet do well.
Call all his noble captains to my lord.
Do so.
Now he’ll outstare the lightning.
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt.
My messenger He hath whipped with rods, dares me to personal combat, Caesar to Antony.
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die, meantime Laugh at his challenge.
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight.
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in .
See it done And feast the army.
He will not fight with me, Domitius?
No.
Why should he not?
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.
Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I’ll fight.
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again.
Woo’t thou fight well?
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.
Well said.
Come on!
Call forth my household servants.
What means this?
’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots Out of the mind.
And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men, And all of you clapped up together in An Antony, that I might do you service So good as you have done.
The gods forbid!
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too, And suffered my command.
What does he mean?
To make his followers weep.
Tend me tonight.
May be it is the period of your duty.
What mean you, sir, To give them this discomfort?
Look, they weep, And I, an ass, am onion eyed.
For shame, Transform us not to women.
Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall!
Brother, good night.
Tomorrow is the day.
It will determine one way.
Fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
Nothing.
What news?
Belike ’tis but a rumor.
Good night to you.
Well, sir, good night.
Soldiers, have careful watch.
And you.
Good night, good night.
Here we.
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up.
’Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.
Peace!
What noise?
List, list!
Hark!
Music i’ th’ air.
Under the earth.
It signs well, does it not?
No.
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?
’Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved, Now leaves him.
How now, masters?
How now?
How now?
Do you hear this?
Ay.
Is ’t not strange?
Do you hear, masters?
Do you hear?
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; Let’s see how it will give off.
Content.
’Tis strange.
Eros!
Mine armor, Eros!
Sleep a little.
No, my chuck.
Eros, come, mine armor, Eros!
Nay, I’ll help too.
What’s this for?
Ah, let be, let be!
Thou art The armorer of my heart.
False, false.
This, this.
Sooth, la, I’ll help.
Thus it must be.
Well, well, We shall thrive now.
Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defenses.
Briefly, sir.
Is not this buckled well?
Rarely, rarely.
He that unbuckles this, till we do please To doff ’t for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my Queen’s a squire More tight at this than thou.
Dispatch.
A thousand, sir, Early though ’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.
The morn is fair.
Good morrow, General.
Good morrow, General.
’Tis well blown, lads.
This morning, like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so.
Come, give me that.
This way.
Well said.
Fare thee well, dame.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier's kiss.
Would you like to retire to your room?
May the gods make this a lucky day for Antony!
If only you and your scarred face had convinced me a short time ago to fight on land!
Who deserted this morning?
Who?
What are you saying?
Sir, he has joined with Caesar.
Is he gone?
It is certain that he is.
Go, Eros, send his treasure to him.
Do it.
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
Our will is Antony be took alive.
Make it so known.
Caesar, I shall.
The time of universal peace is near.
Prove this a prosp’rous day, the three nooked world Shall bear the olive freely.
Antony Is come into the field.
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant, That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself.
Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on Affairs of Antony, there did dissuade Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar And leave his master Antony.
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him.
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust.
I have done ill, Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more.
Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus.
The messenger Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.
I give it you.
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I am alone the villain of the earth, And feel I am so most.
O Antony, Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid My better service, when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold!
This blows my heart.
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do ’t, I feel.
I fight against thee?
No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die.
Retire!
We have engaged ourselves too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home With clouts about their heads.
Thou bleed’st apace.
I had a wound here that was like a “T,” But now ’tis made an “H.
They do retire.
We’ll beat ’em into bench holes.
I have yet Room for six scotches more.
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind!
’Tis sport to maul a runner.
I’ll halt after.
We have beat him to his camp.
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests.
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?
Mine nightingale, We have beat them to their beds.
I’ll give thee, friend, An armor all of gold.
It was a king’s.
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car.
Give me thy hand.
Through Alexandria make a jolly march.
If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard.
The night Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn.
This last day was a shrewd one to ’s.
O bear me witness, night
What man is this?
Stand close and list him.
Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.
Enobarbus?
Peace!
Hark further.
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy, The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, That life, a very rebel to my will, May hang no longer on me.
Let’s speak to him.
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.
Let’s do so.
But he sleeps.
Go we to him.
Awake, sir, awake.
Speak to us.
Hear you, sir?
The hand of death hath raught him.
Come on, then.
He may recover yet.
Their preparation is today by sea.
We please them not by land.
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air, We’d fight there too.
But this it is: our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us.
But being charged, we will be still by land  Which, as I take ’t, we shall, for his best force Is forth to man his galleys.
To the vales, And hold our best advantage.
Yet they are not joined.
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all.
I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go.
Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests.
The auguries Say they know not, they cannot tell, look grimly, And dare not speak their knowledge.
All is lost!
This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me.
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder They cast their caps up and carouse together Like friends long lost.
Triple turned whore!
’Tis thou Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart Makes only wars on thee.
Bid them all fly, For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all.
Bid them all fly.
Begone!
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Caesar’s triumph.
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex.
Help me, my women!
Oh, he’s more mad Than Telamon for his shield.
The boar of Thessaly Was never so embossed.
To th’ monument!
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.
To th’ monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself.
Eros, thou yet behold’st me?
Ay, noble lord.
Ay, my lord.
It does, my lord.
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is Even such a body.
Here I am Antony, Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
No, Antony, My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled With thine entirely.
Hence, saucy eunuch!
Peace!
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.
Death of one person can be paid but once, And that she has discharged.
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand.
The last she spake Was “Antony, most noble Antony!
” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony.
It was divided Between her heart and lips.
She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.
Dead, then?
Dead.
Unarm, Eros.
What would my lord?
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness.
I, that with my sword Quartered the world, and o’er green Neptune’s back With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman  less noble mind Than she which by her death our Caesar tells “I am conqueror of myself.
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
I would not see ’t.
Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.
O sir, pardon me!
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
Lo thee!
My sword is drawn.
Then let it do at once The thing why thou hast drawn it.
My dear master, My captain, and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
’Tis said, man, and farewell.
Farewell, great chief.
Shall I strike now?
Now, Eros.
Why, there then!
What’s the noise?
I have done my work ill, friends.
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!
The star is fall’n.
And time is at his period.
Alas, and woe!
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
Not I.
Nor I.
Nor anyone.
Where’s Antony?
There, Diomed, there.
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?
Art thou there, Diomed?
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.
Most absolute lord, My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
When did she send thee?
Now, my lord.
Where is she?
Locked in her monument.
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass.
For when she saw  Which never shall be found you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead.
But fearing since how it might work, hath sent Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come, I dread, too late.
Too late, good Diomed.
Call my guard, I prithee.
What ho, the Emperor’s guard!
The guard, what ho!
Come, your lord calls!
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.
’Tis the last service that I shall command you.
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear All your true followers out.
Most heavy day!
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows.
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly.
Take me up.
I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends, And have my thanks for all.
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
Be comforted, dear madam.
No, I will not.
All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise.
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.
His death’s upon him, but not dead.
Look out o’ th’ other side your monument.
His guard have brought him thither.
O sun, Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in.
Darkling stand The varying shore o’ th’ world!
O Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below!
Let’s draw him hither.
Peace!
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Oh, quick, or I am gone.
Here’s sport indeed!
How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness, That makes the weight.
Had I great Juno’s power, The strong winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side.
Yet come a little.
Wishers were ever fools.
Oh, come, come, come!
A heavy sight!
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me some wine and let me speak a little.
They do not go together.
Gentle, hear me.
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar.
Noblest of men, woo’t die?
Hast thou no care of me?
Shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty?
O see, my women, The crown o’ th’ earth doth melt.
My lord!
Oh, quietness, lady!
She’s dead too, our sovereign.
Lady!
Madam!
O madam, madam, madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Peace, peace, Iras.
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.
Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks The pauses that he makes.
Caesar, I shall.
Wherefore is that?
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us?
I am called Dercetus.
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served.
Whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters.
If thou please To take me to thee, as I was to him I’ll be to Caesar.
If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life.
What is ’t thou say’st?
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack.
Look you, sad friends, The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings.
And strange it is That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds.
His taints and honors Waged equal with him.
When such a spacious mirror’s set before him, He needs must see himself.
Bid her have good heart.
So the gods preserve thee!
Come hither, Proculeius.
Go and say We purpose her no shame.
Caesar, I shall.
Gallus, go you along.
Dolabella!
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.
He shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war, How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings.
Go with me and see What I can show in this.
My desolation does begin to make A better life.
’Tis paltry to be Caesar.
Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will.
What’s thy name?
My name is Proculeius.
Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting.
Be of good cheer.
You’re fall’n into a princely hand.
Fear nothing.
This I’ll report, dear lady.
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caused it.
You see how easily she may be surprised.
Guard her till Caesar come.
Royal Queen!
O Cleopatra!
Thou art taken, Queen.
Quick, quick, good hands.
Hold, worthy lady, hold!
What, of death too, That rids our dogs of languish?
Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself.
Let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth.
Where art thou, Death?
Come hither, come!
Oh, temperance, lady!
Sir, I will eat no meat, I’ll not drink, sir.
If idle talk will once be necessary, I’ll not sleep neither.
This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can.
Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia.
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome?
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me.
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.
Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee.
For the Queen, I’ll take her to my guard.
So, Dolabella, It shall content me best.
Be gentle to her.
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please, If you’ll employ me to him.
Say I would die.
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
I cannot tell.
Assuredly you know me.
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams.
Is ’t not your trick?
I understand not, madam.
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.
Oh, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man!
If it might please ye
Most sovereign creature
His legs bestrid the ocean.
His reared arm Crested the world.
His voice was propertied As all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends.
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder.
Cleopatra
Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?
Gentle madam, no.
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.
But if there be nor ever were one such, It’s past the size of dreaming.
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it As answering to the weight.
Would I might never O’ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root.
I thank you, sir.
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
Nay, pray you, sir.
Though he be honorable
He’ll lead me, then, in triumph.
Madam, he will.
I know ’t.
Make way there!
Caesar!
Which is the Queen of Egypt?
It is the Emperor, madam.
Arise, you shall not kneel.
I pray you, rise.
Rise, Egypt.
Sir, the gods Will have it thus.
My master and my lord I must obey.
Take to you no hard thoughts.
The record of what injuries you did us, Though written in our flesh, we shall remember As things but done by chance.
And may, through all the world!
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels I am possessed of.
’Tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted.
Where’s Seleucus?
Here, madam.
This is my treasurer.
Let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing.
Speak the truth, Seleucus.
Madam, I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not.
What have I kept back?
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra.
I approve Your wisdom in the deed.
See, Caesar!
Oh, behold How pomp is followed!
Mine will now be yours, And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild.
O slave, of no more trust Than love that’s hired!
What, goest thou back?
Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee!
But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings.
Slave, soulless villain, dog!
Oh, rarely base!
Good Queen, let us entreat you
Forbear, Seleucus.
Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought For things that others do, and when we fall We answer others’ merits in our name, Are therefore to be pitied.
My master, and my lord!
Not so.
Adieu.
Finish, good lady.
The bright day is done, And we are for the dark.
Hie thee again.
I have spoke already, and it is provided.
Go put it to the haste.
Madam, I will.
Where’s the Queen?
Behold, sir.
Dolabella!
Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor.
I your servant.
Adieu, good Queen.
I must attend on Caesar.
Farewell, and thanks.
The gods forbid!
Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras.
Oh, the good gods!
Nay, that’s certain.
I’ll never see ’t!
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes.
Why, that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents.
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.
Let him come in.
This is the man.
Avoid, and leave him.
Truly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal.
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?
Very many, men and women too.
Get thee hence, farewell.
I wish you all joy of the worm.
Farewell.
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.
Ay, ay.
Farewell.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
Take thou no care.
It shall be heeded.
Very good.
Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.
Will it eat me?
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman.
I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not.
Well, get thee gone.
Farewell.
Yes, forsooth.
I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.
Give me my robe.
Put on my crown.
I have Immortal longings in me.
Now no more The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!
This proves me base.
If she first meet the curlèd Antony, He’ll make demand of her and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have.
Come, thou mortal wretch,
O eastern star!
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep?
Oh, break!
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle  O Antony!
Nay, I will take thee too.
In this wild world?
So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled.
Downy windows, close,
Where’s the Queen?
Speak softly.
Wake her not.
Caesar hath sent
Too slow a messenger.
Approach, ho!
All’s not well.
Caesar’s beguiled.
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar.
Call him.
What work is here, Charmian?
Is this well done?
How goes it here?
All dead.
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder.
A way there, a way for Caesar!
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.
That you did fear is done.
Who was last with them?
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
This was his basket.
Poisoned, then.
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now.
She stood and spake.
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress.
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.
Oh, noble weakness!
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
The like is on her arm.
Most probable That so she died, for her physician tells me She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die.
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument.
She shall be buried by her Antony.
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Now, sir, what make you here?
Nothing.
I am not taught to make anything.
What mar you then, sir?
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
Know you where you are, sir?
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.
Know you before whom, sir?
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me.
What, boy!
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
I am no villain.
I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
He was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so.
Thou hast railed on thyself.
Sweet masters, be patient.
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
Let me go, I say.
I will not till I please.
You shall hear me.
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.
You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities.
The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it.
Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament.
With that I will go buy my fortunes.
And what wilt thou do beg when that is spent?
Well, sir, get you in.
I will not long be troubled with you.
You shall have some part of your will.
I pray you leave me.
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
Get you with him, you old dog.
Is it even so?
Begin you to grow upon me?
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.
Holla, Dennis!
Calls your Worship?
Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
Call him in.
Good morrow to your Worship.
Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news at the new court?
There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
Where will the old duke live?
What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter.
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite.
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.
I’ll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
Therefore use thy discretion.
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.
If ever he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.
And so God keep your Worship.
Farewell, good Charles.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee.
If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine.
So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
Let me see what think you of falling in love?
What shall be our sport, then?
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s.
Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.
No?
When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire?
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
Were you made the messenger?
Where learned you that oath, fool?
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
By our beards   , thou art.
By my knavery   , then I were.
But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn.
Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
My father’s love is enough to honor him.
Enough.
Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
By my troth, thou sayest true.
For, since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show.
Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
With his mouth full of news.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
Then shall we be news crammed.
All the better.
We shall be the more marketable.
Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau.
What’s the news?
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
Sport?
Of what color?
What color, madam?
How shall I answer you?
As wit and fortune will.
Or as the Destinies decrees.
Well said.
That was laid on with a trowel.
Nay, if I keep not my rank
Thou losest thy old smell.
You amaze me, ladies.
I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
There comes an old man and his three sons
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.
With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.
Alas!
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
Why, this that I speak of.
Thus men may grow wiser every day.
It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
Or I, I promise thee.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides?
Is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking?
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
Yonder sure they are coming.
Let us now stay and see it.
Come on.
Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
Is yonder the man?
Even he, madam.
Alas, he is too young.
Yet he looks successfully.
How now, daughter and cousin?
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man.
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Do so.
I’ll not be by.
Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.
I attend them with all respect and duty.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
No, fair princess.
He is the general challenger.
I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength.
Do, young sir.
Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized.
We will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
And mine, to eke out hers.
Fare you well.
Pray heaven I be deceived in you.
Your heart’s desires be with you.
Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
You shall try but one fall.
No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
You mean to mock me after, you should not have mocked me before.
But come your ways.
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
O excellent young man!
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.
No more, no more.
Yes, I beseech your Grace.
I am not yet well breathed.
How dost thou, Charles?
He cannot speak, my lord.
Bear him away.
What is thy name, young man?
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well.
Thou art a gallant youth.
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick.
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father’s mind.
Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured.
Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him.
My father’s rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart.
Sir, you have well deserved.
If you do keep your promises in love But justly, as you have exceeded all promise, Your mistress shall be happy.
Ay.
Fare you well, fair gentleman.
He calls us back.
Will you go, coz?
Have with you.
Fare you well.
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
O poor Orlando!
Thou art overthrown.
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place.
I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this: Which of the two was daughter of the duke That here was at the wrestling?
I rest much bounden to you.
Fare you well.
Why, cousin!
Not one to throw at a dog.
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs.
Throw some of them at me.
Come, lame me with reasons.
But is all this for your father?
No, some of it is for my child’s father.
Oh, how full of briers is this working day world!
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery.
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them.
Hem them away.
I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
Oh, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
Oh, a good wish upon you.
You will try in time, in despite of a fall.
But turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest.
Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly.
Yet I hate not Orlando.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
Why should I not?
Doth he not deserve well?
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.
Look, here comes the duke.
With his eyes full of anger.
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.
Me, uncle?
You, cousin.
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.
I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
Thus do all traitors.
If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Thou art thy father’s daughter.
There’s enough.
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.
So was I when your Highness banished him.
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake.
Else had she with her father ranged along.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
I cannot live out of her company.
You are a fool.
You, niece, provide yourself.
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers?
I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
I have more cause.
Thou hast not, cousin.
Prithee, be cheerful.
Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me, his daughter?
That he hath not.
No, hath not?
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
Shall we be sundered?
Shall we part, sweet girl?
No, let my father seek another heir.
Why, whither shall we go?
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face.
The like do you.
So shall we pass along And never stir assailants.
Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man?
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be called?
But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal The clownish fool out of your father’s court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
He’ll go along o'er the wide world with me.
Leave me alone to woo him.
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight.
Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.
Now, my co mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court?
I would not change it.
Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should in their own confines with forkèd heads Have their round haunches gored.
Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that, And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
Oh, yes, into a thousand similes.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.
Show me the place.
I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he’s full of matter.
I’ll bring you to him straight.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be.
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Send to his brother.
Fetch that gallant hither.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.
I’ll make him find him.
Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.
Who’s there?
What, my young master, O my gentle master, O my sweet master, O you memory Of old Sir Rowland!
Why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous?
Why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours.
Your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
Oh, what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!
Why, what’s the matter?
O unhappy youth, Come not within these doors.
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
No matter whither, so you come not here.
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do.
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
But do not so.
O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that do choke their service up Even with the having.
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
I pray you bear with me.
I cannot go no further.
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you.
Yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.
Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.
When I was at home I was in a better place, but travelers must be content.
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
But if thy love were ever like to mine  As sure I think did never man love so  How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily.
If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved.
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise, Thou hast not loved.
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.
And I mine.
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a  night to Jane Smile.
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chpped hands had milked.
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.
” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.
But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.
I faint almost to death.
Holla, you clown!
Peace, fool.
He’s not thy kinsman.
Who calls?
Your betters, sir.
Peace, I say.
Good even to you, friend.
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed, And faints for succor.
Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her.
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality.
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
And we will mend thy wages.
I like this place, And willingly could waste my time in it.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
Go with me.
If you like upon report The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
More, more, I prithee, more.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
I thank it.
More, I prithee, more.
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.
My voice is ragged.
I know I cannot please you.
I do not desire you to please me.
I do desire you to sing.
Come, more, another stanzo.
Call you 'em “stanzos?”
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
More at your request than to please myself.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog apes.
Well, I’ll end the song.
Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.
He hath been all this day to look you.
And I have been all this day to avoid him.
He is too disputable for my company.
I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.
Come, warble, come.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.
And I’ll sing it.
Thus it goes: If it do come to pass That any man turn ass, Leaving his wealth and ease A stubborn will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.
Here shall he see Gross fools as he, An if he will come to me.
What’s that “ducdame”?
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.
I’ll go sleep if I can.
If I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first born of Egypt.
And I’ll go seek the duke.
His banquet is prepared.
Dear master, I can go no further.
Oh, I die for food.
Here lie I down and measure out my grave.
Farewell, kind master.
Why, how now, Adam?
No greater heart in thee?
Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little.
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
For my sake, be comfortable.
Hold death awhile at the arm’s end.
I think he be transformed into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence.
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
He saves my labor by his own approach.
Why, how now, monsieur?
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily.
A fool, a fool, I met a fool i' th' forest, A motley fool.
A miserable world!
What fool is this?
O worthy fool!
One that hath been a courtier And says, “If ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it.
” And in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms.
Oh, that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Thou shalt have one.
Fie on thee!
I can tell what thou wouldst do.
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
Why, who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party?
Forbear, and eat no more.
Why, I have eat none yet.
Nor shalt not till necessity be served.
Of what kind should this cock come of?
You touched my vein at first.
The thorny point Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show Of smooth civility, yet am I inland bred And know some nurture.
But forbear, I say.
He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answerèd.
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
What would you have?
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
Speak you so gently?
Pardon me, I pray you.
I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment.
But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time, If ever you have looked on better days, If ever been where bells have knolled to church, If ever sat at any good man’s feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be, In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church, And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
And therefore sit you down in gentleness, And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministered.
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food.
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love.
Till he be first sufficed, Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit.
Go find him out, And we will nothing waste till you return.
I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
This wide and universal theater Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in.
All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.
At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.
And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow.
Welcome.
Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.
I thank you most for him.
Welcome.
Fall to.
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither.
I am the duke That loved your father.
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me.
Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm.
Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.
Not see him since?
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present.
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.
Seek him with candle.
Bring him, dead or living, Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.
Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.
More villain thou.
And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
Such a one is a natural philosopher.
Wast ever in court, shepherd?
No, truly.
Then thou art damned.
Nay, I hope.
Truly, thou art damned, like an ill roasted egg, all on one side.
For not being at court?
Your reason.
Not a whit, Touchstone.
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
Instance, briefly.
Come, instance.
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
Shallow, shallow.
A better instance, I say.
Come.
Besides, our hands are hard.
Your lips will feel them the sooner.
Shallow again.
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar?
The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
Most shallow man.
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed.
You have too courtly a wit for me.
I’ll rest.
Wilt thou rest damned?
God help thee, shallow man.
God make incision in thee; thou art raw.
Sir, I am a true laborer.
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
From the east to western Ind, No jewel is like Rosalind.
Her worth being mounted on the wind, Through all the world bears Rosalind.
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind.
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind.
I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.
It is the right butter women’s rank to market.
Out, fool.
For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind.
If the cat will after kind, So, be sure, will Rosalind.
Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind.
They that reap must sheaf and bind, Then to cart with Rosalind.
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind; Such a nut is Rosalind.
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
This is the very false gallop of verses.
Why do you infect yourself with them?
Peace, you dull fool.
I found them on a tree.
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar.
Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.
Peace.
Here comes my sister reading.
Stand aside.
Why should this a desert be?
For it is unpeopled?
No.
Tongues I’ll hang on every tree That shall civil sayings show.
O most gentle Jupiter, what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried, “Have patience, good people.
How now?
Back, friends.
Shepherd, go off a little.
Go with him, sirrah.
Didst thou hear these verses?
Oh, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
That’s no matter.
The feet might bear the verses.
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came, for look here what I found on a palm tree.
I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.
Trow you who hath done this?
Is it a man?
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
Change you color?
I prithee, who?
Nay, but who is it?
Is it possible?
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
Good my complexion, dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition?
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace.
I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle  either too much at once, or none at all.
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.
So you may put a man in your belly.
Is he of God’s making?
What manner of man?
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful.
Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.
Nay, but the devil take mocking.
Speak sad brow and true maid.
I' faith, coz, ’tis he.
Orlando?
Orlando.
Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
What did he when thou saw’st him?
What said he?
How looked he?
Wherein went he?
What makes him here?
Did he ask for me?
Where remains he?
How parted he with thee?
And when shalt thou see him again?
Answer me in one word.
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel?
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover.
But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance.
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.
Give me audience, good madam.
Proceed.
There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.
Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee.
It curvets unseasonably.
He was furnished like a hunter.
Oh, ominous!
He comes to kill my heart.
I would sing my song without a burden.
Thou bring’st me out of tune.
Do you not know I am a woman?
When I think, I must speak.
Sweet, say on.
You bring me out.
Soft, comes he not here?
'Tis he.
Slink by, and note him.
God be wi' you.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill  favoredly.
Rosalind is your love’s name?
Yes, just.
I do not like her name.
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.
What stature is she of?
Just as high as my heart.
You are full of pretty answers.
Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and conned them out of rings?
You have a nimble wit.
I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels.
Will you sit down with me?
And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery.
I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
I am weary of you.
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
He is drowned in the brook.
Look but in, and you shall see him.
There I shall see mine own figure.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
I’ll tarry no longer with you.
Farewell, good Signior Love.
I am glad of your departure.
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.
I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear, forester?
Very well.
What would you?
[As Ganymede)   I pray you, what is ’t o'clock?
You should ask me what time o' day.
There’s no clock in the forest.
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.
And why not the swift foot of time?
Had not that been as proper?
By no means, sir.
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons.
I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized.
If the interim be but a se'nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.
Who ambles time withal?
Who doth he gallop withal?
Who stays it still withal?
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat.
Are you native of this place?
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
I have been told so of many.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?
There were none principal.
They were all like one another as half pence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
I prithee, recount some of them.
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick.
I am he that is so love shaked.
I pray you tell me your remedy.
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you.
He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
What were his marks?
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not  but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.
But you are no such man.
You are rather point device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
Me believe it?
You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does.
That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences.
But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
Did you ever cure any so?
I would not be cured, youth.
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.
Tell me where it is.
With all my heart, good youth.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.
Come, sister, will you go?
Come apace, good Audrey.
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.
And how, Audrey?
Am I the man yet?
Doth my simple feature content you?
Your features, Lord warrant us!
What features?
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
When a man’s verses cannot be understood nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
I do not know what “poetical” is.
Is it honest in deed and word?
Is it a true thing?
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
Would you not have me honest?
A material fool.
Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.
I would fain see this meeting.
Well, the gods give us joy.
Amen.
A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn beasts.
But what though?
Courage.
Is there none here to give the woman?
I will not take her on gift of any man.
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
Proceed, proceed.
I’ll give her.
Good even, good Monsieur What ye call’t.
How do you, sir?
You are very well met.
God 'ild you for your last company.
I am very glad to see you.
Even a toy in hand here, sir.
Nay, pray be covered.
Will you be married, motley?
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar?
Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is.
This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot.
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Come, sweet Audrey.
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
'Tis no matter.
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.
Never talk to me.
I will weep.
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.
But have I not cause to weep?
As good cause as one would desire.
Therefore weep.
Something browner than Judas’s.
Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.
I' faith, his hair is of a good color.
An excellent color.
Your chestnut was ever the only color.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana.
A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously.
The very ice of chastity is in them.
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
Do you think so?
Not true in love?
You have heard him swear downright he was.
“Was” is not “is.
” Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster.
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him.
Oh, that’s a brave man.
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.
Well, and what of him?
If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you, If you will mark it.
O, come, let us remove.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Do not, Phoebe.
Say that you love me not, but say not so In bitterness.
The common executioner, Whose heart th' accustomed sight of death makes hard, Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon.
Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
I would not be thy executioner.
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.
O dear Phoebe, If ever as that ever may be near  You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make.
But till that time Come not thou near me.
And why, I pray you?
Who might be your mother, That you insult, exult, and all at once, Over the wretched?
What though you have no beauty  As, by my faith, I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed  Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this?
Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature’s sale work.
'Od’s my little life, I think she means to tangle my eyes, too.
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream That can entame my spirits to your worship.
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
He’s fall'n in love with your foulness.
And she’ll fall in love with my anger.
If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words.
Why look you so upon me?
For no ill will I bear you.
Sweet Phoebe
Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?
Sweet Phoebe, pity me.
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
Thou hast my love.
Is not that neighborly?
I would have you.
Why, that were covetousness.
So holy and so perfect is my love, And I in such a poverty of grace, That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps.
Loose now and then A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
'Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well  But what care I for words?
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth not very pretty  But sure he’s proud and yet his pride becomes him.
He’ll make a proper man.
The best thing in him Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall yet for his years he’s tall.
His leg is but so so and yet ’tis well.
There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
Phoebe, with all my heart.
I’ll write it straight.
The matter’s in my head and in my heart.
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvius.
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
I am so.
I do love it better than laughing.
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.
A traveler.
By my faith, you have great reason to be sad.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s.
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Yes, I have gained my experience.
And your experience makes you sad.
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it, too.
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.
Nay then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
Farewell, Monsieur Traveler.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
Break an hour’s promise in love?
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
I had as lief be wooed of a snail.
Of a snail?
Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman.
Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
What’s that?
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for.
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.
And I am your Rosalind.
It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent.
What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?
I would kiss before I spoke.
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
How if the kiss be denied?
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
What, of my suit?
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
Am not I your Rosalind?
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.
Well, in her person I say I will not have you.
Then, in mine own person I die.
No, faith, die by attorney.
The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love cause.
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.
By this hand, it will not kill a fly.
Then love me, Rosalind.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
And wilt thou have me?
Ay, and twenty such.
What sayest thou?
Are you not good?
I hope so.
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
Give me your hand, Orlando.
What do you say, sister?
Pray thee, marry us.
I cannot say the words.
You must begin “Will you, Orlando ”
Go to.
Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
I will.
Ay, but when?
Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband.
There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.
So do all thoughts.
They are winged.
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.
Forever and a day.
But will my Rosalind do so?
By my life, she will do as I do.
Oh, but she is wise.
Or else she could not have the wit to do this.
The wiser, the waywarder.
Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement.
Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.
Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say “Wit, whither wilt?”
Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed.
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
Marry, to say she came to seek you there.
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue.
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
I must attend the duke at dinner.
By two o'clock I will be with thee again.
Ay, go your ways, go your ways.
I knew what you would prove.
My friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
That flattering tongue of yours won me.
'Tis but one cast away, and so, come, death.
Two o'clock is your hour?
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.
So, adieu.
You have simply misused our sex in your love prate.
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.
But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.
And I’ll sleep.
Which is he that killed the deer?
Sir, it was I.
Let’s present him to the duke like a Roman conqueror.
And it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory.
Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
Yes, sir.
Sing it.
'Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.
How say you now?
Is it not past two o'clock?
And here much Orlando.
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.
My errand is to you, fair youth.
My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.
I know not the contents, but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor.
Pardon me.
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.
Phoebe did write it.
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand.
She has a leathern hand, A freestone colored hand.
I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.
She has a huswife’s hand but that’s no matter.
I say she never did invent this letter.
Sure it is hers.
Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style, A style for challengers.
Why, she defies me Like Turk to Christian.
So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
She Phoebes me.
Mark how the tyrant writes.
Art thou god to shepherd turned, That a maiden’s heart hath burned?
Can a woman rail thus?
Call you this railing?
Call you this chiding?
Alas, poor shepherd.
Do you pity him?
No, he deserves no pity.
Wilt thou love such a woman?
What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee?
Not to be endured.
Good morrow, fair ones.
Pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?
West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom, The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself.
There’s none within.
If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin.
Are you he?
I am.
What must we understand by this?
Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stained.
I pray you, tell it.
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.
And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural.
But to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
Are you his brother?
Was ’t you he rescued?
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
But for the bloody napkin?
By and by.
Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
There is more in it.
Cousin Ganymede.
Look, he recovers.
I would I were at home.
We’ll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
Be of good cheer, youth.
You a man?
You lack a man’s heart.
I do so, I confess it.
Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited.
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited.
Heigh ho.
This was not counterfeit.
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
Counterfeit, I assure you.
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
So I do.
But i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
Come, you look paler and paler.
Pray you, draw homewards.
Good sir, go with us.
That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
I shall devise something.
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
Will you go?
We shall find a time, Audrey.
Patience, gentle Audrey.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.
Ay, I know who ’tis.
He hath no interest in me in the world.
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.
By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for.
We shall be flouting.
We cannot hold.
Good ev'n, Audrey.
God gi' good ev'n, William.
And good ev'n to you, sir.
Good ev'n, gentle friend.
Cover thy head, cover thy head.
Nay, prithee, be covered.
How old are you, friend?
Five and twenty, sir.
A ripe age.
Is thy name William?
William, sir.
A fair name.
Wast born i' th' forest here?
Ay, sir, I thank God.
“Thank God.
” A good answer.
'Faith, sir, so so.
“So so” is good, very good, very excellent good.
And yet it is not: it is but so so.
Art thou wise?
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
Why, thou sayst well.
I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
” The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open.
You do love this maid?
I do, sir.
Give me your hand.
Art thou learned?
No, sir.
Then learn this of me: to have is to have.
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other.
For all your writers do consent that ipse is “he.
” Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
Which he, sir?
He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Do, good William.
God rest you merry, sir.
Our master and mistress seeks you.
Come away, away.
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.
I attend, I attend.
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her?
That, but seeing, you should love her?
You have my consent.
Let your wedding be tomorrow.
Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers.
Go you and prepare Aliena, for look you, here comes my Rosalind.
God save you, brother.
And you, fair sister.
O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.
It is my arm.
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher?
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
Oh, I know where you are.
Nay, ’tis true.
There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw, and overcame.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.
But Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes.
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
I can live no longer by thinking.
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit.
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are.
Neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and not to grace me.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.
Speak’st thou in sober meanings?
By my life I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness To show the letter that I writ to you.
I care not if I have.
It is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.
It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.
And I for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.
It is to be all made of faith and service, And so am I for Phoebe.
And I for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.
And so am I for Ganymede.
And so am I for Rosalind.
And so am I for no woman.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Why do you speak, too, “Why blame you me to love you?”?
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
Pray you, no more of this.
'Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon.
I will help you, if I can.
I would love you if I could.
Tomorrow meet me all together.
I will marry you if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be married tomorrow.
I will satisfy you if ever I satisfy man, and you shall be married tomorrow.
I will content you, if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.
As you love Rosalind, meet.
As you love Phoebe, meet.
And as I love no woman, I’ll meet.
So fare you well.
I have left you commands.
I’ll not fail, if I live.
Nor I.
Nor I.
Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey.
Tomorrow will we be married.
I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.
Well met, honest gentleman.
By my troth, well met.
Come, sit, sit, and a song.
We are for you.
Sit i' th' middle.
Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untunable.
You are deceived, sir.
We kept time.
We lost not our time.
By my troth, yes.
I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song.
God be wi' you, and God mend your voices.
Come, Audrey.
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd?
Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, You will bestow her on Orlando here?
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
And you say you will have her when I bring her?
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?
That will I, should I die the hour after.
But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
So is the bargain.
You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will?
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
I have promised to make all this matter even.
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.
There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark.
Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
Salutation and greeting to you all.
Good my lord, bid him welcome.
This is the motley minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest.
He hath been a courtier, he swears.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
I have trod a measure.
I have flattered a lady.
I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy.
I have undone three tailors.
I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
And how was that ta'en up?
Faith, we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
How “seventh cause?” Good my lord, like this fellow.
I like him very well.
God 'ild you, sir.
I desire you of the like.
I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks.
A poor virgin, sir, an ill favored thing, sir, but mine own.
A poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will.
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
But for the seventh cause.
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
Upon a lie seven times removed.
Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners.
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.
He uses his folly like a stalking horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.
Good duke, receive thy daughter.
Hymen from heaven brought her, Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within her bosom is.
To you I give myself, for I am yours.
To you I give myself, for I am yours.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.
I’ll have no father, if you be not he.
Peace, ho!
I bar confusion.
'Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange events.
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
I will not eat my word.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Welcome, young man.
Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers' wedding: To one his lands withheld, and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
He hath.
To him will I.
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.
You to your former honor I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
You to a love that your true faith doth merit.
You to your land, and love, and great allies.
You to a long and well deservèd bed.
Stay, Jaques, stay.
To see no pastime I.
What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
Proceed, proceed.
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
Speak, speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
We know't, we know't.
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
One word, good citizens.
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well; and could be content to give him good report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him.
You must in no way say he is covetous.
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these?
The other side o' the city is risen: why stay we prating here?
to the Capitol!
Come, come.
Soft!
who comes here?
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved the people.
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
What work's, my countrymen, in hand?
where go you With bats and clubs?
The matter?
speak, I pray you.
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds.
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, Will you undo yourselves?
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you.
Care for us!
True, indeed!
Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, Or be accused of folly.
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
Sir, I shall tell you.
Your belly's answer?
What!
The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye, The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric, if that they
What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks!
What then?
what then?
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, Who is the sink o' the body,
Well, what then?
The former agents, if they did complain, What could the belly answer?
I will tell you If you'll bestow a small of what you have little  Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
Ye're long about it.
Ay, sir; well, well.
'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each, Yet I can make my audit up, that all From me do back receive the flour of all, And leave me but the bran.  '
What say you to't?
It was an answer: how apply you this?
I the great toe!
Hail, noble Marcius!
Thanks.
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, Make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, That like nor peace nor war?
the one affrights you, The other makes you proud.
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say, The city is well stored.
Hang 'em!
They say!
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
What is granted them?
This is strange.
Go, get you home, you fragments!
Where's Caius Marcius?
Here: what's the matter?
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us; The Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility, And were I any thing but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together.
Then, worthy Marcius, Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
It is your former promise.
Sir, it is; And I am constant.
Titus Lartius, thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff?
stand'st out?
No, Caius Marcius; I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other, Ere stay behind this business.
O, true bred!
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know, Our greatest friends attend us.
Lead you on.
Follow Cominius; We must follow you; Right worthy you priority.
Noble Marcius!
Hence to your homes; be gone!
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
Nay.
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
Be mock the modest moon.
The present wars devour him: he is grown Too proud to be so valiant.
Besides, if things go well, Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius.
Let's hence, and hear How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, More than his singularity, he goes Upon this present action.
Lets along.
So, your opinion is, Aufidius, That they of Rome are entered in our counsels And know how we proceed.
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state, That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome Had circumvention?
'Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
Our army's in the field We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us.
Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veil'd till when They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching, It seem'd, appear'd to Rome.
By the discovery We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot.
O, doubt not that; I speak from certainties.
Nay, more, Some parcels of their power are forth already, And only hitherward.
I leave your honours.
The gods assist you!
And keep your honours safe!
Farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell.
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue.
Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
Indeed, you shall not.
His bloody brow!
O Jupiter, no blood!
Away, you fool!
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee And tread upon his neck.
My ladies both, good day to you.
Sweet madam.
I am glad to see your ladyship.
How do you both?
you are manifest house keepers.
What are you sewing here?
A fine spot, in good faith.
How does your little son?
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than look upon his school master.
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a very pretty boy.
One on 's father's moods.
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
A crack, madam.
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
Not out of doors!
She shall, she shall.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
Why, I pray you?
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.
Indeed, madam?
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
In troth, I think she would.
Fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet lady.
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not.
I wish you much mirth.
Well, then, farewell.
Yonder comes news.
A wager they have met.
My horse to yours, no.
'Tis done.
Agreed.
Say, has our general met the enemy?
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
So, the good horse is mine.
I'll buy him of you.
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will For half a hundred years.
How far off lie these armies?
Within this mile and half.
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
No, nor a man that fears you less than he, That's lesser than a little.
Hark!
our drums Are bringing forth our youth.
Hark you.
far off!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes Amongst your cloven army.
O, they are at it!
Their noise be our instruction.
Ladders, ho!
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight With hearts more proof than shields.
All the contagion of the south light on you, You shames of Rome!
Fool hardiness; not I.
Nor I.
See, they have shut him in.
To the pot, I warrant him.
What is become of Marcius?
Slain, sir, doubtless.
O noble fellow!
Look, sir.
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
This will I carry to Rome.
And I this.
A murrain on't!
I took this for silver.
See here these movers that do prize their hours At a crack'd drachm!
Cushions, leaden spoons, Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes!
To him!
Now the fair goddess, Fortune, Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms Misguide thy opposers' swords!
Bold gentleman, Prosperity be thy page!
Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest!
So, farewell.
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market place; Call thither all the officers o' the town, Where they shall know our mind: away!
Thy news?
Though thou speak'st truth, Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?
Above an hour, my lord.
Who's yonder, That does appear as he were flay'd?
O gods He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have Before time seen him thus.
Come I too late?
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue From every meaner man.
Come I too late?
O, let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart As merry as when our nuptial day was done, And tapers burn'd to bedward!
Where is that slave Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he?
call him hither.
But how prevail'd you?
Will the time serve to tell?
I do not think.
Where is the enemy?
are you lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?
Marcius, We have at disadvantage fought and did Retire to win our purpose.
How lies their battle?
know you on which side They have placed their men of trust?
As I guess, Marcius, Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates, Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius, Their very heart of hope.
Those are they That most are willing.
If any such be here  As it were sin to doubt  that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report; If any think brave death outweighs bad life And that his country's dearer than himself; Let him alone, or so many so minded, Wave thus, to express his disposition, And follow Marcius.
O, me alone!
make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you But is four Volsces?
Fear not our care, sir.
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee Worse than a promise breaker.
We hate alike: Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy.
Fix thy foot.
Let the first budger die the other's slave, And the gods doom him after!
If I fly, Marcius, Holloa me like a hare.
Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny, Thou shouldst not scape me here.
O general, Here is the steed, we the caparison: Hadst thou beheld
Pray now, no more: my mother, Who has a charter to extol her blood, When she does praise me grieves me.
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart To hear themselves remember'd.
Should they not, Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude, And tent themselves with death.
May these same instruments, which you profane, Never sound more!
when drums and trumpets shall I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be Made all of false faced soothing!
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
I will go wash; And when my face is fair, you shall perceive Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
So, to our tent; Where, ere we do repose us, we will write To Rome of our success.
I shall, my lord.
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should Be free as is the wind.
Deliver him, Titus.
Marcius, his name?
By Jupiter!
forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?
The town is ta'en!
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot, Being a Volsce, be that I am.
Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find I' the part that is at mercy?
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Will not you go?
I shall, sir.
The augurer tells me we shall have news to night.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Marcius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
Pray you, who does the wolf love?
The lamb.
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius.
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb.
You two are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
Well, sir.
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two have not in abundance?
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
Especially in pride.
And topping all others in boasting.
This is strange now: do you two know how you are censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the right hand file?
do you?
Why, how are we censured?
Because you talk of pride now, will you not be angry?
Well, well, sir, well.
We do it not alone, sir.
What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing.
You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller; and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies, and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler, whither do you follow your eyes so fast?
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the love of Juno, let's go.
Ha!
Marcius coming home!
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous approbation.
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee.
Hoo!
Marcius coming home!
Nay,'tis true.
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for me!
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
A letter for me!
O, no, no, no.
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a' victory in his pocket?
the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
Good ladies, let's go.
Yes, yes, yes; the senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war: he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Wondrous!
ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.
The gods grant them true!
True!
True!
I'll be sworn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
God save your good worships!
Marcius is coming home: he has more cause to be proud.
Where is he wounded?
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place.
He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh, there's nine that I know.
He had, before this last expedition, twenty five wounds upon him.
Now it's twenty seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Hark!
the trumpets.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
No more of this; it does offend my heart: Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother!
O, You have, I know, petition'd all the gods For my prosperity!
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home, That weep'st to see me triumph?
Ay, my dear, Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear, And mothers that lack sons.
Now, the gods crown thee!
O my sweet lady, pardon.
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home: And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
A hundred thousand welcomes.
I could weep And I could laugh, I am light and heavy.
Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart, That is not glad to see thee!
You are three That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men, We have some old crab trees here at home that will not Be grafted to your relish.
Ever right.
Menenius ever, ever.
Give way there, and go on!
Know, good mother, I had rather be their servant in my way, Than sway with them in theirs.
On, to the Capitol!
On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, During his power, go sleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honours From where he should begin and end, but will Lose those he hath won.
In that there's comfort.
I heard him swear, Were he to stand for consul, never would he Appear i' the market place nor on him put The napless vesture of humility; Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
'Tis right.
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him, And the desire of the nobles.
I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution.
'Tis most like he will.
It shall be to him then as our good wills, A sure destruction.
So it must fall out To him or our authorities.
What's the matter?
You are sent for to the Capitol.
Let's to the Capitol; And carry with us ears and eyes for the time, But hearts for the event.
Have with you.
Come, come, they are almost here.
How many stand for consulships?
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.
If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him; and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite.
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they are coming.
We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly.
Which the rather We shall be blest to do, if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at.
That's off, that's off; I would you rather had been silent.
Please you To hear Cominius speak?
Most willingly; But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it.
He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear What you have nobly done.
Sir, I hope My words disbench'd you not.
No, sir: yet oft, When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but your people, I love them as they weigh.
Pray now, sit down.
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd.
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly.
Worthy man!
He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him.
He's right noble: Let him be call'd for.
Call Coriolanus.
He doth appear.
I do owe them still My life and services.
It then remains That you do speak to the people.
Sir, the people Must have their voices; neither will they bate One jot of ceremony.
It is apart That I shall blush in acting, and might well Be taken from the people.
Mark you that?
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus; Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only!
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people, Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour.
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
You see how he intends to use the people.
May they perceive's intent!
He will require them, As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give.
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
We may, sir, if we will.
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
Think you so?
Which way do you judge my wit would fly?
Why that way?
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
Are you all resolved to give your voices?
But that's no matter, the greater part carries it.
I say, if he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his behavior.
We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes.
Content, content.
O sir, you are not right: have you not known The worthiest men have done't?
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'  Plague upon't!
I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace: 'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran From the noise of our own drums.  '
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: you must desire them To think upon you.
Think upon me!
hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues Which our divines lose by 'em.
Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
Mine own desert.
Your own desert!
Ay, but not mine own desire.
How not your own desire?
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly!
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
I have your alms: adieu.
But this is something odd.
An 'twere to give again, but 'tis no matter.
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily.
You have received many wounds for your country.
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them.
I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve, Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here, To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear, Their needless vouches?
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought; Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six I have seen and heard of; for your voices have Done many things, some less, some more your voices: Indeed I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.
Amen, amen.
God save thee, noble consul!
Worthy voices!
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes Endue you with the people's voice: remains That, in the official marks invested, you Anon do meet the senate.
Is this done?
Where?
at the senate house?
There, Coriolanus.
May I change these garments?
You may, sir.
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again, Repair to the senate house.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink 'Tis warm at 's heart.
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?
How now, my masters!
have you chose this man?
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
Certainly He flouted us downright.
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
Why, so he did, I am sure.
No, no; no man saw 'em.
Why either were you ignorant to see't, Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness To yield your voices?
Have you Ere now denied the asker?
and now again Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow Your sued for tongues?
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties; make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so.
Say, you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections, and that your minds, Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should, made you against the grain To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
Ay, spare us not.
Say we read lectures to you.
We will so: almost all Repent in their election.
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused Our swifter composition.
So then the Volsces stand but as at first, Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
They are worn, lord consul, so, That we shall hardly in our ages see Their banners wave again.
Saw you Aufidius?
Spoke he of me?
He did, my lord.
How?
what?
How often he had met you, sword to sword; That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution, so he might Be call'd your vanquisher.
At Antium lives he?
At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully.
Welcome home.
Pass no further.
Ha!
what is that?
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
What makes this change?
The matter?
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
Cominius, no.
Have I had children's voices?
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market place.
The people are incensed against him.
Stop, Or all will fall in broil.
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues?
What are your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?
Be calm, be calm.
Why, this was known before.
Not to them all.
Have you inform'd them sithence?
How!
I inform them!
You are like to do such business.
Not unlike, Each way, to better yours.
Why then should I be consul?
By yond clouds, Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me Your fellow tribune.
Let's be calm.
The people are abused; set on.
This paltering Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely I' the plain way of his merit.
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again
Not now, not now.
Not in this heat, sir, now.
Now, as I live, I will.
Well, no more.
No more words, we beseech you.
How!
no more!
You speak o' the people, As if you were a god to punish, not A man of their infirmity.
'Twere well We let the people know't.
What, what?
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is, Not poison any further.
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
mark you His absolute 'shall'?
'Twas from the canon.
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians!
Well, on to the market place.
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used Sometime in Greece,
Well, well, no more of that.
Though there the people had more absolute power, I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed The ruin of the state.
I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices.
Come, enough.
Enough, with over measure.
Has said enough.
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer As traitors do.
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
Manifest treason!
This a consul?
no.
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.
Hence, old goat!
Aged sir, hands off.
Help, ye citizens!
On both sides more respect.
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
Seize him, AEdiles!
Down with him!
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
Tribunes, Patricians, Citizens, what ho!
Sicinius, Brutus, Coriolanus, citizens!
Peace, peace, peace!
Stay, hold, peace!
What is about to be?
I am out of breath; Confusion's near; I cannot speak.
You, tribunes To the people!
Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.
Hear me, people; peace!
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
What is the city but the people?
True, The people are the city.
By the consent of all, we were establish'd The people's magistrates.
You so remain.
And so are like to do.
That is the way to lay the city flat; To bring the roof to the foundation, And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges, In heaps and piles of ruin.
This deserves death.
Or let us stand to our authority, Or let us lose it.
We do here pronounce, Upon the part o' the people, in whose power We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy Of present death.
Therefore lay hold of him; Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence Into destruction cast him.
AEdiles, seize him!
Yield, Marcius, yield!
Hear me one word; Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
Peace, peace!
Be that you seem, truly your country's friend, And temperately proceed to what you would Thus violently redress.
Sir, those cold ways, That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous Where the disease is violent.
Lay hands upon him, And bear him to the rock.
No, I'll die here.
Down with that sword!
Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
Lay hands upon him.
Help Marcius, help, You that be noble; help him, young and old!
Down with him, down with him!
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.
Get you gone.
Sham it be put to that?
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house; Leave us to cure this cause.
For 'tis a sore upon us, You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
Come, sir, along with us.
I would they were barbarians as they are, Though in Rome litter'd not Romans as they are not, Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol
Be gone; Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; One time will owe another.
On fair ground I could beat forty of them.
Nay, come away.
This man has marr'd his fortune.
Here's goodly work!
I would they were abed!
I would they were in Tiber!
What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?
Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself?
You worthy tribunes,
He shall well know The noble tribunes are the people's mouths, And we their hands.
He shall, sure on't.
Sir, sir,
Peace!
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt With modest warrant.
Sir, how comes't that you Have holp to make this rescue?
Hear me speak: As I do know the consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults,
Consul!
what consul?
The consul Coriolanus.
He consul!
No, no, no, no, no.
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, I may be heard, I would crave a word or two; The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
This is clean kam.
The service of the foot Being once gangrened, is not then respected For what before it was.
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence: Lest his infection, being of catching nature, Spread further.
One word more, one word.
This tiger footed rage, when it shall find The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late Tie leaden pounds to's heels.
Proceed by process; Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out, And sack great Rome with Romans.
If it were so,
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote?
ourselves resisted?
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd In bolted language; meal and bran together He throws without distinction.
Noble Menenius, Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.
Go not home.
Meet on the market place.
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company.
He must come, or what is worst will follow.
Pray you, let's to him.
You do the nobler.
I talk of you: Why did you wish me milder?
would you have me False to my nature?
Rather say I play The man I am.
O, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.
Let go.
Let them hang.
Ay, and burn too.
Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough; You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy; Unless, by not so doing, our good city Cleave in the midst, and perish.
Pray, be counsell'd: I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage.
Well said, noble woman?
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, Which I can scarcely bear.
What must I do?
Return to the tribunes.
Well, what then?
what then?
Repent what you have spoke.
For them!
I cannot do it to the gods; Must I then do't to them?
Tush, tush!
A good demand.
Why force you this?
Noble lady!
Prithee now, Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower.
Here is Cominius.
I have been i' the market place; and, sir,'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
Only fair speech.
I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear?
Come, come, we'll prompt you.
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier, so, To have my praise for this, perform a part Thou hast not done before.
Well, I must do't: Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit!
my throat of war be turn'd, Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Do your will.
Away!
The word is 'mildly.  '
Ay, but mildly.
Well, mildly be it then.
Mildly!
What, will he come?
He's coming.
How accompanied?
With old Menenius, and those senators That always favour'd him.
Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll?
I have; 'tis ready.
Have you collected them by tribes?
I have.
I shall inform them.
And when such time they have begun to cry, Let them not cease, but with a din confused Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence.
Very well.
Make them be strong and ready for this hint, When we shall hap to give 't them.
Go about it.
Well, here he comes.
Calmly, I do beseech you.
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece Will bear the knave by the volume.
The honour'd gods Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men!
plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, And not our streets with war!
Amen, amen.
A noble wish.
Draw near, ye people.
List to your tribunes.
Audience: peace, I say!
First, hear me speak.
Well, say.
Peace, ho!
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, If you submit you to the people's voices, Allow their officers and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be proved upon you?
I am content.
Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only.
Well, well, no more.
What is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice, I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again?
Answer to us.
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
We charge you, that you have contrived to take From Rome all season'd office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical; For which you are a traitor to the people.
How!
traitor!
Nay, temperately; your promise.
The fires i' the lowest hell fold in the people!
Call me their traitor!
Thou injurious tribune!
Mark you this, people?
To the rock, to the rock with him!
Peace!
But since he hath Served well for Rome,
What do you prate of service?
I talk of that, that know it.
You?
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
Know, I pray you,
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,
We know your drift: speak what?
It shall be so, it shall be so.
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
Our enemy is banish'd!
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him, As he hath followed you, with all despite; Give him deserved vexation.
Let a guard Attend us through the city.
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes!
Come.
O heavens!
O heavens!
Nay!
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, And occupations perish!
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd.
My first son.
Whither wilt thou go?
Take good Cominius With thee awhile: determine on some course,
O the gods!
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send O'er the vast world to seek a single man, And lose advantage, which doth ever cool I' the absence of the needer.
That's worthily As any ear can hear.
Come, let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years From these old arms and legs, by the good gods, I'ld with thee every foot.
Give me thy hand: Come.
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided In his behalf.
Now we have shown our power, Let us seem humbler after it is done Than when it was a doing.
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.
Let's not meet her.
Why?
They say she's mad.
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods Requite your love!
Peace, peace; be not so loud.
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,  Nay, and you shall hear some.
Will you be gone?
You shall stay too: I would I had the power To say so to my husband.
Are you mankind?
Ay, fool; is that a shame?
Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father?
O blessed heavens!
More noble blows than ever thou wise words; And for Rome's good.
What then?
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
Come, come, peace.
I would he had continued to his country As he began, and not unknit himself
I would he had.
'I would he had'!
Pray, let us go.
Now, pray, sir, get you gone: You have done a brave deed.
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits?
Take my prayers with you.
I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses!
Could I meet 'em But once a day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to't.
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself, And so shall starve with feeding.
Fie, fie, fie!
I know you well, sir, and you know me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
Nicanor?
no.
The same, sir.
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your favour is well approved by your tongue.
What's the news in Rome?
I have a note from the Volscian state, to find you out there: you have well saved me a day's journey.
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
Hath been!
is it ended, then?
Our state thinks not so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
Coriolanus banished!
Banished, sir.
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
The day serves well for them now.
I have heard it said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband.
Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request of his country.
He cannot choose.
I am most fortunate, thus accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of their adversaries.
Have you an army ready, say you?
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause to be glad of yours.
Well, let us go together.
A goodly city is this Antium.
Save you, sir.
And you.
Direct me, if it be your will, Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state At his house this night.
Which is his house, beseech you?
This, here before you.
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns!
Wine, wine, wine!
What service is here!
I think our fellows are asleep.
Where's Cotus?
my master calls for him.
Cotus!
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I Appear not like a guest.
What would you have, friend?
whence are you?
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
I have deserved no better entertainment, In being Coriolanus.
Whence are you, sir?
Has the porter his eyes in his head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.
Away!
Away!
Now thou'rt troublesome.
Are you so brave?
I'll have you talked with anon.
What fellow's this?
What have you to do here, fellow?
Pray you, avoid the house.
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
What are you?
A gentleman.
A marvellous poor one.
True, so I am.
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
What, you will not?
Prithee, tell my master what a strange guest he has here.
And I shall.
Where dwellest thou?
Under the canopy.
Under the canopy!
Ay.
Where's that?
I' the city of kites and crows.
I' the city of kites and crows!
What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?
No, I serve not thy master.
How, sir!
do you meddle with my master?
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress.
Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy trencher, hence!
Where is this fellow?
Whence comest thou?
what wouldst thou?
thy name?
Why speak'st not?
speak, man: what's thy name?
What is thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine.
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st thou me yet?
I know thee not: thy name?
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy.
You bless me, gods!
Here's a strange alteration!
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.
What an arm he has!
he turned me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
He had so; looking as it were would I were hanged, but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Who, my master?
Nay, it's no matter for that.
Worth six on him.
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the greater soldier.
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
Ay, and for an assault too.
O slaves, I can tell you news, news, you rascals!
What, what, what?
let's partake.
Wherefore?
wherefore?
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Marcius.
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always good enough for him.
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
An he had been cannibally given, he might have broiled and eaten him too.
But, more of thy news?
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
Do't!
Directitude!
what's that?
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with him.
But when goes this forward?
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad makers.
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money.
I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.
They are rising, they are rising.
In, in, in, in!
We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?
Hail sir!
Hail to you both!
Where is he, hear you?
The gods preserve you both!
God den, our neighbours.
God den to you all, god den to you all.
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees, Are bound to pray for you both.
Live, and thrive!
Now the gods keep you!
Farewell, farewell.
This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets, Crying confusion.
Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent, O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, Self loving,
And affecting one sole throne, Without assistance.
I think not so.
We should by this, to all our lamentation, If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome Sits safe and still without him.
Worthy tribunes, There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, Reports, the Volsces with two several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories, And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em.
Come, what talk you Of Marcius?
Go see this rumourer whipp'd.
It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can, And three examples of the like have been Within my age.
Tell not me: I know this cannot be.
Not possible.
Yes, worthy sir, The slave's report is seconded; and more, More fearful, is deliver'd.
What more fearful?
It is spoke freely out of many mouths  How probable I do not know  that Marcius, Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing.
This is most likely!
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home again.
The very trick on't.
O, you have made good work!
What news?
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates, To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,
What's the news?
what's the news?
Your temples burned in their cement, and Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined Into an auger's bore.
Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.
Pray, your news?
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,
If!
You have made good work, You and your apron men; you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic eaters!
He will shake Your Rome about your ears.
As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!
But is this true, sir?
Ay; and you'll look pale Before you find it other.
All the regions Do smilingly revolt; and who resist Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, And perish constant fools.
Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.
We are all undone, unless The noble man have mercy.
Who shall ask it?
You have brought A trembling upon Rome, such as was never So incapable of help.
Say not we brought it.
How!
Was it we?
we loved him but, like beasts And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, Who did hoot him out o' the city.
But I fear They'll roar him in again.
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him?
You are they That made the air unwholesome, when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus' exile.
Faith, we hear fearful news.
For mine own part, When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
And so did I.
Ye re goodly things, you voices!
You have made Good work, you and your cry!
Shall's to the Capitol?
O, ay, what else?
The gods be good to us!
Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished him.
So did we all.
But, come, let's home.
I do not like this news.
Nor I.
Let's to the Capitol.
Would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie!
Pray, let us go.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I cannot help it now, Unless, by using means, I lame the foot Of our design.
Yet I wish, sir,  I mean for your particular,  you had not Join'd in commission with him; but either Had borne the action of yourself, or else To him had left it solely.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
He would not seem to know me.
Do you hear?
Why, so: you have made good work!
Very well: Could he say less?
For one poor grain or two!
No, I'll not meddle.
Pray you, go to him.
What should I do?
Only make trial what your love can do For Rome, towards Marcius.
Well, and say that Marcius Return me, as Cominius is return'd, Unheard; what then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure As you intended well.
I'll undertake 't: I think he'll hear me.
You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way.
Good faith, I'll prove him, Speed how it will.
I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success.
He'll never hear him.
Not?
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury The gaoler to his pity.
Stay: whence are you?
Stand, and go back.
From whence?
From Rome.
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before You'll speak with Coriolanus.
Good my friends, If you have heard your general talk of Rome, And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks, My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely.
Therefore, go back.
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say, you cannot pass.
Therefore, go back.
Has he dined, canst thou tell?
for I would not speak with him till after dinner.
You are a Roman, are you?
I am, as thy general is.
Then you should hate Rome, as he does.
Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be?
Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this?
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation.
Come, my captain knows you not.
I mean, thy general.
My general cares not for you.
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,
What's the matter?
Away!
How!
away!
Wife, mother, child, I know not.
My affairs Are servanted to others: though I owe My revenge properly, my remission lies In Volscian breasts.
That we have been familiar, Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather Than pity note how much.
Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force.
You keep a constant temper.
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the way home again.
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back?
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
I neither care for the world nor your general: for such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, ye're so slight.
A noble fellow, I warrant him.
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow Set down our host.
My partner in this action, You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly I have borne this business.
This last old man, Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, Loved me above the measure of a father; Nay, godded me, indeed.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand The grandchild to her blood.
But, out, affection!
My lord and husband!
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so.
Like a dull actor now, I have forgot my part, and I am out, Even to a full disgrace.
Best of my flesh, Forgive my tyranny; but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans.  '
What is this?
Your knees to me?
Thou art my warrior; I holp to frame thee.
Do you know this lady?
The noble sister of Publicola, The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle That's curdied by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
This is a poor epitome of yours, Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.
Your knee, sirrah.
That's my brave boy!
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, Are suitors to you.
O, no more, no more!
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile.
Ay, and mine, That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name Living to time.
Not of a woman's tenderness to be, Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.
Nay, go not from us thus.
O mother, mother!
What have you done?
Behold, the heavens do ope, The gods look down, and this unnatural scene They laugh at.
O my mother, mother!
O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome; But, for your son,  believe it, O, believe it, Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, If not most mortal to him.
But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have heard A mother less?
or granted less, Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour At difference in thee: out of that I'll work Myself a former fortune.
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond corner stone?
Why, what of that?
If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution.
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man!
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub.
This Marcius is grown from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a creeping thing.
He loved his mother dearly.
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
I paint him in the character.
The gods be good unto us!
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
When we banished him, we respected not them; and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
What's the news?
Friend, Art thou certain this is true?
is it most certain?
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes, Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans, Make the sun dance.
Hark you!
This is good news: I will go meet the ladies.
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, Accept my thankfulness.
Sir, we have all Great cause to give great thanks.
They are near the city?
Almost at point to enter.
We will meet them, And help the joy.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
Most welcome!
How is it with our general?
Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, And with his charity slain.
Most noble sir, If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you Of your great danger.
Sir, I cannot tell: We must proceed as we do find the people.
I know it; And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction.
Sir, his stoutness When he did stand for consul, which he lost By lack of stooping,
Your native town you enter'd like a post, And had no welcomes home: but he returns, Splitting the air with noise.
And patient fools, Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear With giving him glory.
Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself, or move the people With what he would say, let him feel your sword, Which we will second.
When he lies along, After your way his tale pronounced shall bury His reasons with his body.
Say no more: Here come the lords.
You are most welcome home.
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused What I have written to you?
We have.
And grieve to hear't.
He approaches: you shall hear him.
Hail, lords!
I am return'd your soldier, No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting Under your great command.
You are to know That prosperously I have attempted and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome.
Our spoils we have brought home Do more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action.
Read it not, noble lords; But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree He hath abused your powers.
Traitor!
how now!
Ay, traitor, Marcius!
Marcius!
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Ha!
No more.
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it.
Boy!
O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever I was forced to scold.
Peace, both, and hear me speak.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, Stain all your edges on me.
Boy!
false hound!
Why, noble lords, Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, 'Fore your own eyes and ears?
Let him die for't.
'Tear him to pieces.  '
'Do it presently.  '
'He kill'd my son.  '
'My daughter.  '
'He killed my cousin Marcus.  '
'He killed my father.  '
Peace, ho!
no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds in This orb o' the earth.
His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing.
Stand, Aufidius, And trouble not the peace.
O that I had him, With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, To use my lawful sword!
Insolent villain!
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
Hold, hold, hold, hold!
My noble masters, hear me speak.
O Tullus,
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Tread not upon him.
Masters all, be quiet; Put up your swords.
His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.
My rage is gone; And I am struck with sorrow.
Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully: Trail your steel pikes.
But what's the matter?
None but the king?
And why so?
You speak him far.
What's his name and birth?
I honour him Even out of your report.
But, pray you, tell me, Is she sole child to the king?
His only child.
How long is this ago?
Some twenty years.
Howsoe'er 'tis strange, Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at, Yet is it true, sir.
I do well believe you.
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman, The queen, and princess.
Please your highness, I will from hence to day.
You know the peril.
O Dissembling courtesy!
How fine this tyrant Can tickle where she wounds!
My queen!
my mistress!
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause To be suspected of more tenderness Than doth become a man.
Should we be taking leave As long a term as yet we have to live, The loathness to depart would grow.
Adieu!
How, how!
another?
You gentle gods, give me but this I have, And sear up my embracements from a next With bonds of death!
Remain, remain thou here While sense can keep it on.
O the gods!
When shall we see again?
Alack, the king!
Thou basest thing, avoid!
hence, from my sight!
If after this command thou fraught the court With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
Thou'rt poison to my blood.
The gods protect you!
And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.
There cannot be a pinch in death More sharp than this is.
O disloyal thing, That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st A year's age on me.
Past grace?
Obedience?
Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
O blest, that I might not!
I chose an eagle, And did avoid a puttock.
No; I rather added A lustre to it.
O thou vile one!
What, art thou mad?
Almost, sir: heaven restore me!
Thou foolish thing!
Beseech your patience.
Peace, Dear lady daughter, peace!
Sweet sovereign, Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort Out of your best advice.
Fie!
you must give way.
Here is your servant.
How now, sir!
My lord your son drew on my master.
Ha!
No harm, I trust, is done?
I am very glad on't.
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
To draw upon an exile!
O brave sir!
I humbly thank your highness.
Pray, walk awhile.
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it.
Have I hurt him?
No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
Hurt him!
His steel was in debt; it went o' the backside the town.
The villain would not stand me.
No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
Stand you!
You have land enough of your own: but he added to your having; gave you some ground.
As many inches as you have oceans.
Puppies!
I would they had not come between us.
So would I, till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground.
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damned.
She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.
Come, I'll to my chamber.
Would there had been some hurt done!
I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.
You'll go with us?
I'll attend your lordship.
Nay, come, let's go together.
Well, my lord.
It was his queen, his queen!
Then waved his handkerchief?
And kiss'd it, madam.
Thou shouldst have made him As little as a crow, or less, ere left To after eye him.
Madam, so I did.
Be assured, madam, With his next vantage.
The queen, madam, Desires your highness' company.
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
I will attend the queen.
Madam, I shall.
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
And then his banishment.
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out.
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
What do you esteem it at?
More than the world enjoys.
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's outprized by a trifle.
Which the gods have given you?
Which, by their graces, I will keep.
You may wear her in title yours: but, you know, strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds.
Let us leave here, gentlemen.
Sir, with all my heart.
No, no.
What's that?
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the approbation of what I have spoke!
What lady would you choose to assail?
Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
You are afraid, and therein the wiser.
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's spoken, I swear.
Will you?
I will have it no lay.
By the gods, it is one.
If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us.
Agreed.
Will this hold, think you?
Signior Iachimo will not from it.
Pray, let us follow 'em.
I, madam.
Dispatch.
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
I wonder, doctor, Thou ask'st me such a question.
Have I not been Thy pupil long?
Hast thou not learn'd me how To make perfumes?
O, content thee.
[To himself I'm suspicious of you, ma'am.
Listen, I have something to tell you.
I don't like her.
Good bye.
A father cruel, and a step dame false; A foolish suitor to a wedded lady, That hath her husband banish'd;  O, that husband!
My supreme crown of grief!
and those repeated Vexations of it!
Had I been thief stol'n, As my two brothers, happy!
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome, Comes from my lord with letters.
Change you, madam?
The worthy Leonatus is in safety And greets your highness dearly.
Thanks, good sir: You're kindly welcome.
All of her that is out of door most rich!
'He is one of the noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied.
Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust   LEONATUS.  '
Thanks, fairest lady.
What, are men mad?
Hath nature given them eyes To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones Upon the number'd beach?
and can we not Partition make with spectacles so precious 'Twixt fair and foul?
What makes your admiration?
What is the matter, trow?
What, dear sir, Thus raps you?
Are you well?
Thanks, madam; well.
I was going, sir, To give him welcome.
Continues well my lord?
His health, beseech you?
Well, madam.
Is he disposed to mirth?
I hope he is.
When he was here, He did incline to sadness, and oft times Not knowing why.
I never saw him sad.
Will my lord say so?
Not he, I hope.
What do you pity, sir?
Two creatures heartily.
Am I one, sir?
Lamentable!
What, To hide me from the radiant sun and solace I' the dungeon by a snuff?
I pray you, sir, Deliver with more openness your answers To my demands.
Why do you pity me?
That others do   I was about to say  enjoy your   But It is an office of the gods to venge it, Not mine to speak on 't.
My lord, I fear, Has forgot Britain.
And himself.
Let me hear no more.
O dearest soul!
your cause doth strike my heart With pity, that doth make me sick.
Revenged!
How should I be revenged?
If this be true,   As I have such a heart that both mine ears Must not in haste abuse  if it be true, How should I be revenged?
Should he make me Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets, Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps, In your despite, upon your purse?
What, ho, Pisanio!
Let me my service tender on your lips.
Away!
I do condemn mine ears that have So long attended thee.
If thou wert honourable, Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not For such an end thou seek'st,  as base as strange.
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far From thy report as thou from honour, and Solicit'st here a lady that disdains Thee and the devil alike.
O happy Leonatus!
I may say The credit that thy lady hath of thee Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness Her assured credit.
Blessed live you long!
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever Country call'd his!
and you his mistress, only For the most worthiest fit!
Give me your pardon.
You make amends.
My humble thanks.
Pray, what is't?
O, no, no.
I thank you for your pains: But not away to morrow!
I will write.
Was there ever man had such luck!
when I kissed the jack, upon an up cast to be hit away!
What got he by that?
You have broke his pate with your bowl.
If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all out.
When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for any standers by to curtail his oaths, ha?
No my lord;
Whoreson dog!
I give him satisfaction?
Would he had been one of my rank!
To have smelt like a fool.
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a pox on't!
Sayest thou?
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offence to.
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
Why, so I say.
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to night?
A stranger, and I not know on't!
He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of Leonatus' friends.
Leonatus!
a banished rascal; and he's another, whatsoever he be.
Who told you of this stranger?
One of your lordship's pages.
Is it fit I went to look upon him?
is there no derogation in't?
You cannot derogate, my lord.
Not easily, I think.
I'll attend your lordship.
That such a crafty devil as is his mother Should yield the world this ass!
a woman that Bears all down with her brain; and this her son Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart, And leave eighteen.
Who's there?
my woman Helen?
Please you, madam
What hour is it?
Almost midnight, madam.
To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night Guard me, beseech ye.
The crickets sing, and man's o'er labour'd sense Repairs itself by rest.
Our Tarquin thus Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd The chastity he wounded.
Cytherea, How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily, And whiter than the sheets!
That I might touch!
But kiss; one kiss!
Rubies unparagon'd, How dearly they do't!
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.
It would make any man cold to lose.
But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship.
You are most hot and furious when you win.
Winning will put any man into courage.
If I could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
It's almost morning, is't not?
Day, my lord.
The MUSICIANS sing.
So, get you gone.
Here comes the king.
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
Will she not forth?
I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.
You are most bound to the king, Who lets go by no vantages that may Prefer you to his daughter.
Senseless!
not so.
Who's there that knocks?
A gentleman.
No more?
Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
That's more Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours, Can justly boast of.
What's your lordship's pleasure?
Your lady's person: is she ready?
Ay, To keep her chamber.
There is gold for you; Sell me your good report.
How!
my good name?
Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
Good morrow, sir.
Still, I swear I love you.
This is no answer.
But that you shall not say I yield being silent, I would not speak.
To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin: I will not.
Fools are not mad folks.
Do you call me fool?
You sin against Obedience, which you owe your father.
The south fog rot him!
He never can meet more mischance than come To be but named of thee.
His meanest garment, That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer In my respect than all the hairs above thee, Were they all made such men.
How now, Pisanio!
'His garment!  '
Now the devil
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently
'His garment!  '
I am sprited with a fool.
'Twill not be lost.
I hope so: go and search.
You have abused me: 'His meanest garment!  '
I will inform your father.
I'll be revenged: 'His meanest garment!  '
Well.
What means do you make to him?
Your very goodness and your company O'erpays all I can do.
See!
Iachimo!
The swiftest harts have posted you by land; And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails, To make your vessel nimble.
Welcome, sir.
I hope the briefness of your answer made The speediness of your return.
Your lady Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty Look through a casement to allure false hearts And be false with them.
Here are letters for you.
Their tenor good, I trust.
'Tis very like.
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were there?
He was expected then, But not approach'd.
All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont?
or is't not Too dull for your good wearing?
If I had lost it, I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
The stone's too hard to come by.
Not a whit, Your lady being so easy.
Good sir, we must, If you keep covenant.
Proceed.
More particulars Must justify my knowledge.
So they must, Or do your honour injury.
This is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap, Being, as it is, much spoke of.
This is her honour!
Let it be granted you have seen all this  and praise Be given to your remembrance   the description Of what is in her chamber nothing saves The wager you have laid.
Then, if you can,
Jove!
May be she pluck'd it off To send it me.
She writes so to you, doth she?
O, no, no, no!
'tis true.
Here, take this too;
It is a basilisk unto mine eye, Kills me to look on't.
Very true; And so, I hope, he came by't.
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
Never talk on't; She hath been colted by him.
Will you hear more?
I'll be sworn
No swearing.
I'll deny nothing.
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb meal!
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before Her father.
I'll do something
Quite besides The government of patience!
With all my heart.
Is there no way for men to be but women Must be half workers?
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,   Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less Than in his feats deserving it  for him And his succession granted Rome a tribute, Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately Is left untender'd.
That opportunity Which then they had to take from 's, to resume We have again.
Son, let your mother end.
We do.
Thou art welcome, Caius.
Let proof speak.
His majesty bids you welcome.
So, sir.
I know your master's pleasure and he mine: All the remain is 'Welcome!  '
How?
of adultery?
Wherefore write you not What monster's her accuser?
Leonatus, O master!
How now, Pisanio!
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
Who?
thy lord?
that is my lord, Leonatus!
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer That knew the stars as I his characters; He'ld lay the future open.
One score 'twixt sun and sun, Madam, 's enough for you:
Madam, you're best consider.
A goodly day not to keep house, with such Whose roof's as low as ours!
Hail, heaven!
Hail, heaven!
What should we speak of When we are old as you?
How you speak!
Did you but know the city's usuries And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb Is certain falling, or so slippery that
Uncertain favour!
What shall I need to draw my sword?
the paper Hath cut her throat already.
False to his bed!
What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
To weep 'twixt clock and clock?
if sleep charge nature, To break it with a fearful dream of him And cry myself awake?
that's false to's bed, is it?
Alas, good lady!
I false!
Good madam, hear me.
Hence, vile instrument!
Thou shalt not damn my hand.
O gracious lady, Since I received command to do this business I have not slept one wink.
Do't, and to bed then.
I'll wake mine eye balls blind first.
Wherefore then Didst undertake it?
Why hast thou abused So many miles with a pretence?
this place?
Mine action and thine own?
our horses' labour?
The time inviting thee?
the perturb'd court, For my being absent?
whereunto I never Purpose return.
But to win time To lose so bad employment; in the which I have consider'd of a course.
Good lady, Hear me with patience.
Then, madam, I thought you would not back again.
Most like; Bringing me here to kill me.
Some Roman courtezan.
No, on my life.
Why good fellow, What shall I do the while?
where bide?
how live?
Or in my life what comfort, when I am Dead to my husband?
If you'll back to the court
If not at court, Then not in Britain must you bide.
Where then Hath Britain all the sun that shines?
Day, night, Are they not but in Britain?
I' the world's volume Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
I am most glad You think of other place.
O, for such means!
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't, I would adventure.
First, make yourself but like one.
Thou art all the comfort The gods will diet me with.
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell, Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of Your carriage from the court.
Amen: I thank thee.
Thus far; and so farewell.
Thanks, royal sir.
And you!
Your hand, my lord.
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth I wear it as your enemy.
Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, Till he have cross'd the Severn.
Happiness!
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor How it goes here.
'Tis not sleepy business; But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
Our expectation that it would be thus Hath made us forward.
But, my gentle queen, Where is our daughter?
Where is she, sir?
How Can her contempt be answer'd?
Please you, sir, Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
Her doors lock'd?
Not seen of late?
Grant, heavens, that which I fear Prove false!
Son, I say, follow the king.
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, have not seen these two days.
Go, look after.
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
'Tis certain she is fled.
O, good my lord!
Where is thy lady?
Or, by Jupiter,   I will not ask again.
Close villain, I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip Thy heart to find it.
Is she with Posthumus?
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot A dram of worth be drawn.
Alas, my lord, How can she be with him?
When was she missed?
He is in Rome.
Where is she, sir?
O, my all worthy lord!
All worthy villain!
Then, sir, This paper is the history of my knowledge Touching her flight.
Let's see't.
I will pursue her Even to Augustus' throne.
Hum!
I'll write to my lord she's dead.
O Imogen, Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
Sirrah, is this letter true?
Sir, as I think.
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't.
Well, my good lord.
Wilt thou serve me?
Sir, I will.
Give me thy hand; here's my purse.
Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession?
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither: let it be thy lint service; go.
I shall, my lord.
Meet thee at Milford Haven!
Ay, my noble lord.
How long is't since she went to Milford Haven?
She can scarce be there yet.
I am thoroughly weary.
I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
Stay; come not in.
But that it eats our victuals, I should think Here were a fairy.
What's the matter, sir?
By Jupiter, an angel!
or, if not, An earthly paragon!
Behold divineness No elder than a boy!
Money, youth?
Whither bound?
To Milford Haven.
What's your name?
Fidele, sir.
Prithee, fair youth, Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds By this rude place we live in.
Well encounter'd!
Were you a woman, youth, I should woo hard but be your groom.
In honesty, I bid for you as I'd buy.
'Mongst friends, If brothers.
He wrings at some distress.
Would I could free't!
Or I, whate'er it be, What pain it cost, what danger.
God's!
Hark, boys.
It shall be so.
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt.
Pray, draw near.
The night to the owl and morn to the lark less welcome.
Thanks, sir.
I pray, draw near.
Is Lucius general of the forces?
Ay.
Remaining now in Gallia?
We will discharge our duty.
I am near to the place where they should meet, if Pisanio have mapped it truly.
How fit his garments serve me!
Brother, stay here.
Are we not brothers?
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
What!
how!
O noble strain!
O worthiness of nature!
breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base: Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
I'm not their father; yet who this should be, Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
Brother, farewell.
I wish ye sport.
You health.
So please you, sir.
These are kind creatures.
Gods, what lies I have heard!
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court: Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter I might know more.
To the field, to the field!
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
We'll not be long away.
Pray, be not sick, For you must be our housewife.
Well or ill, I am bound to you.
And shalt be ever.
This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had Good ancestors.
How angel like he sings!
But his neat cookery!
Grow, patience!
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine His perishing root with the increasing vine!
It is great morning.
Come, away!
Who's there?
I cannot find those runagates; that villain Hath mock'd me.
I am faint.
'Those runagates!  '
Means he not us?
I partly know him: 'tis Cloten, the son o' the queen.
I fear some ambush.
I saw him not these many years, and yet I know 'tis he.
We are held as outlaws: hence!
Soft!
What are you That fly me thus?
some villain mountaineers?
I have heard of such.
What slave art thou?
A thing More slavish did I ne'er than answering A slave without a knock.
Thou art a robber, A law breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
To who?
to thee?
What art thou?
Have not I An arm as big as thine?
a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not My dagger in my mouth.
Say what thou art, Why I should yield to thee?
Thou villain base, Know'st me not by my clothes?
No, nor thy tailor, rascal, Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes, Which, as it seems, make thee.
Thou precious varlet, My tailor made them not.
Hence, then, and thank The man that gave them thee.
Thou injurious thief, Hear but my name, and tremble.
What's thy name?
Cloten, thou villain.
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name, I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or Adder, Spider, 'Twould move me sooner.
To thy further fear, Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know I am son to the queen.
Art not afeard?
No companies abroad?
None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
What hast thou done?
We are all undone.
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose, But that he swore to take, our lives?
The law Protects not us: then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us, Play judge and executioner all himself, For we do fear the law?
What company Discover you abroad?
No single soul Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason He must have some attendants.
Let ordinance Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er, My brother hath done well.
I fear 'twill be revenged: Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't!
though valour Becomes thee well enough.
Would I had done't So the revenge alone pursued me!
Poor sick Fidele!
O thou goddess, Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st In these two princely boys!
Where's my brother?
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream, In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage For his return.
My ingenious instrument!
Hark, Polydore, it sounds!
But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion?
Hark!
Is he at home?
He went hence even now.
What does he mean?
since death of my dear'st mother it did not speak before.
All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents.
The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?
Look, here he comes, And brings the dire occasion in his arms Of what we blame him for.
The bird is dead That we have made so much on.
I had rather Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty, To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch, Than have seen this.
O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when thou grew'st thyself.
O melancholy!
Where?
Prithee, have done; And do not play in wench like words with that Which is so serious.
Let us bury him, And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt.
To the grave!
Say, where shall's lay him?
By good Euriphile, our mother.
We'll speak it, then.
Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten Is quite forgot.
Pray You, fetch him hither.
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax', When neither are alive.
If you'll go fetch him, We'll say our song the whilst.
Brother, begin.
'Tis true.
Come on then, and remove him.
So.
Begin.
Fear no more the lightning flash,
Nor the all dreaded thunder stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee, and come to dust.
No exorciser harm thee!
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!
Quiet consummation have; And renowned be thy grave!
We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.
Yes, sir, to Milford Haven; which is the way?
I thank you.
By yond bush?
Pray, how far thither?
'Ods pittikins!
can it be six mile yet?
I have gone all night.
'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
But, soft!
no bedfellow!
O god s and goddesses!
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia, After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending You here at Milford Haven with your ships: They are in readiness.
But what from Rome?
When expect you them?
With the next benefit o' the wind.
This forwardness Makes our hopes fair.
Dream often so, And never false.
Soft, ho!
what trunk is here Without his top?
The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building.
How!
a page!
He's alive, my lord.
He'll then instruct us of this body.
Young one, Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems They crave to be demanded.
Who is this Thou makest thy bloody pillow?
Or who was he That, otherwise than noble nature did, Hath alter'd that good picture?
What's thy interest In this sad wreck?
How came it?
Who is it?
What art thou?
I am nothing: or if not, Nothing to be were better.
This was my master, A very valiant Briton and a good, That here by mountaineers lies slain.
'Lack, good youth!
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.
Richard du Champ.
Thy name?
Fidele, sir.
Thou dost approve thyself the very same: Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
Wilt take thy chance with me?
I'll follow, sir.
Ay, good youth!
And rather father thee than master thee.
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
A fever with the absence of her son, A madness, of which her life's in danger.
The time is troublesome.
So please your majesty, The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, Are landed on your coast, with a supply Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
I am amazed with matter.
I thank you.
Let's withdraw; And meet the time as it seeks us.
We fear not What can from Italy annoy us; but We grieve at chances here.
Away!
The noise is round about us.
Let us from it.
What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it From action and adventure?
Nay, what hope Have we in hiding us?
This way, the Romans Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us For barbarous and unnatural revolts During their use, and slay us after.
Sons, We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
This is, sir, a doubt In such a time nothing becoming you, Nor satisfying us.
It is not likely That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes And ears so cloy'd importantly as now, That they will waste their time upon our note, To know from whence we are.
Than be so Better to cease to be.
So say I amen.
No reason I, since of your lives you set So slight a valuation, should reserve My crack'd one to more care.
Have with you, boys!
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd Thou shouldst be colour'd thus.
You married ones, If each of you should take this course, how many Must murder wives much better than themselves For wrying but a little!
O Pisanio!
Stand, stand!
Stand, stand, and fight!
'Tis their fresh supplies.
Camest thou from where they made the stand?
I did.
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
I did.
Where was this lane?
This was strange chance A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
Nay, be not angry, sir.
'Lack, to what end?
Farewell; you're angry.
Still going?
Great Jupiter be praised!
Lucius is taken.
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
There was a fourth man, in a silly habit, That gave the affront with them.
So 'tis reported: But none of 'em can be found.
Stand!
who's there?
A Roman, Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds Had answer'd him.
Lay hands on him; a dog!
Ay, or a stomach.
Most welcome, bondage!
Great nature, like his ancestry, Moulded the stuff so fair, That he deserved the praise o' the world, As great Sicilius' heir.
When once he was mature for man, In Britain where was he That could stand up his parallel; Or fruitful object be In eye of Imogen, that best Could deem his dignity?
With marriage wherefore was he mock'd, To be exiled, and thrown From Leonati seat, and cast From her his dearest one, Sweet Imogen?
Thy crystal window ope; look out; No longer exercise Upon a valiant race thy harsh And potent injuries.
Since, Jupiter, our son is good, Take off his miseries.
Help, Jupiter; or we appeal, And from thy justice fly.
No more, you petty spirits of region low, Offend our hearing; hush!
Thanks, Jupiter!
The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd His radiant root.
Away!
and, to be blest, Let us with care perform his great behest.
Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot A father to me; and thou hast created A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
Gone!
Come, sir, are you ready for death?
Over roasted rather; ready long ago.
So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.
A heavy reckoning for you, sir.
I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.
What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness!
I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.
I'll be hang'd then.
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone.
Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made Preservers of my throne.
No tidings of him?
He hath been search'd among the dead and living, But no trace of him.
To my grief, I am The heir of his reward;
Hail, great king!
To sour your happiness, I must report The queen is dead.
Who worse than a physician Would this report become?
But I consider, By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death Will seize the doctor too.
How ended she?
Prithee, say.
O most delicate fiend!
Who is 't can read a woman?
Is there more?
More, sir, and worse.
She did confess she had For you a mortal mineral; which, being took, Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
Heard you all this, her women?
We did, so please your highness.
I have surely seen him: His favour is familiar to me.
I humbly thank your highness.
I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad; And yet I know thou wilt.
What wouldst thou, boy?
Wherefore eyest him so?
I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please To give me hearing.
Ay, with all my heart, And lend my best attention.
What's thy name?
Fidele, sir.
Is not this boy revived from death?
The same dead thing alive.
Peace, peace!
But we saw him dead.
Be silent; let's see further.
Come, stand thou by our side; Make thy demand aloud.
My boon is, that this gentleman may render Of whom he had this ring.
What's that to him?
That diamond upon your finger, say How came it yours?
Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
How!
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that Which torments me to conceal.
All that belongs to this.
That paragon, thy daughter,   For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits Quail to remember  Give me leave; I faint.
My daughter!
what of her?
Upon a time,  unhappy was the clock That struck the hour!
it was in Rome,  accursed The mansion where!
'twas at a feast,  O, would Our viands had been poison'd, or at least Those which I heaved to head!
the good Posthumus   What should I say?
I stand on fire: Come to the matter.
All too soon I shall, Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly.
Nay, nay, to the purpose.
Your daughter's chastity  there it begins.
Ay, so thou dost, Italian fiend!
Peace, my lord; hear, hear
Shall's have a play of this?
Thou scornful page, There lie thy part.
O, gentlemen, help!
Mine and your mistress!
O, my lord Posthumus!
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now.
Help, help!
Mine honour'd lady!
Does the world go round?
How come these staggers on me?
Wake, my mistress!
If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me To death with mortal joy.
How fares thy mistress?
The tune of Imogen!
New matter still?
It poison'd me.
O gods!
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection Which I gave him for cordial, she is served As I would serve a rat.  '
What's this, Comelius?
Most like I did, for I was dead.
My boys, There was our error.
This is, sure, Fidele.
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock; and now Throw me again.
Hang there like a fruit, my soul, Till the tree die!
How now, my flesh, my child!
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
Wilt thou not speak to me?
Your blessing, sir.
Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not: You had a motive for't.
My tears that fall Prove holy water on thee!
Imogen, Thy mother's dead.
I am sorry for't, my lord.
My lord, Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth.
Lord Cloten, Upon my lady's missing, came to me With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore, If I discover'd not which way she was gone, It was my instant death .
Let me end the story: I slew him there.
Marry, the gods forfend!
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth, Deny't again.
I have spoke it, and I did it.
He was a prince.
I am sorry for thee: By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
That headless man I thought had been my lord.
Bind the offender, And take him from our presence.
Why, old soldier, Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for, By tasting of our wrath?
How of descent As good as we?
In that he spake too far.
And thou shalt die for't.
Your danger's ours.
And our good his.
Have at it then, by leave.
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who Was call'd Belarius.
What of him?
he is A banish'd traitor.
Nursing of my sons!
How!
my issue!
So sure as you your father's.
Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
The service that you three have done is more Unlike than this thou tell'st.
Be pleased awhile.
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore, Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
Guiderius had Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star; It was a mark of wonder.
O, what, am I A mother to the birth of three?
Ne'er mother Rejoiced deliverance more.
Blest pray you be, That, after this strange starting from your orbs, may reign in them now!
O Imogen, Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
No, my lord; I have got two worlds by 't.
O my gentle brothers, Have we thus met?
Did you e'er meet?
Ay, my good lord.
And at first meeting loved; Continued so, until we thought he died.
By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
O rare instinct!
When shall I hear all through?
This fierce abridgement Hath to it circumstantial branches, which Distinction should be rich in.
Where?
how lived you?
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
How parted with your brothers?
how first met them?
Why fled you from the court?
and whither?
You are my father too, and did relieve me, To see this gracious season.
My good master, I will yet do you service.
Happy be you!
The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought, He would have well becomed this place, and graced The thankings of a king.
Nobly doom'd!
We'll learn our freeness of a son in law; Pardon's the word to all.
Your servant, princes.
Philarmonus!
Here, my good lord.
Read, and declare the meaning.
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.  '
This hath some seeming.
Well My peace we will begin.
The fingers of the powers above do tune The harmony of this peace.
Laud we the gods; And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our blest altars.
Publish we this peace To all our subjects.
Who’s there?
Nay, answer me.
Stand and unfold yourself.
Long live the king!
Barnardo?
He.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
‘Tis now struck twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.
For this relief much thanks.
‘Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.
Have you had quiet guard?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
I think I hear them.
Stand, ho!
Who’s there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Who hath relieved you?
Barnardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Holla, Barnardo.
Say what, is Horatio there?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, good Marcellus.
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we have two nights seen.
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one
Peace, break thee off.
Look where it comes again!
In the same figure like the king that’s dead.
Thou art a scholar.
Speak to it, Horatio.
Looks it not like the king?
Most like.
It harrows me with fear and wonder.
It would be spoke to.
Question it, Horatio.
What art thou that usurp’st this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march?
By heaven, I charge thee, speak.
It is offended.
See, it stalks away.
Stay!
Speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!
‘Tis gone and will not answer.
How now, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on ’t?
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
Is it not like the king?
As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated.
So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
‘Tis strange.
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
In what particular thought to work I know not, But in the gross and scope of mine opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
That can I.
I think it be no other but e’en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armèd through our watch so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.
But soft, behold!
Lo, where it comes again.
I’ll cross it though it blast me.
Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound or use of voice, Speak to me.
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me.
If thou art privy to thy country’s fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, Oh, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.
Stay and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do, if it will not stand.
‘Tis here.
‘Tis here.
‘Tis gone.
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever ‘gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?
You told us of some suit.
What is ’t, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Have you your father’s leave?
What says Polonius?
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laborsome petition, and at last Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.
Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will.
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so, my lord.
I am too much i’ the sun.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Ay, madam, it is common.
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?
“Seems,” madam?
Nay, it is.
I know not “seems.
‘Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father.
But you must know your father lost a father, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow.
But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness.
‘Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschooled.
For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart?
Fie!
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee, stay with us.
Go not to Wittenberg.
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark.
Hail to your lordship.
I am glad to see you well.
Horatio?
Or I do forget myself?
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Marcellus!
My good lord.
I am very glad to see you.
Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.
I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
My father methinks I see my father.
Where, my lord?
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.
He was a man.
Take him for all in all.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Saw who?
My lord, the king your father.
The king my father?
!
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
For God’s love, let me hear.
But where was this?
My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
Did you not speak to it?
My lord, I did, But answer made it none.
‘Tis very strange.
As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch tonight?
Armed, say you?
From top to toe?
Then saw you not his face?
Oh yes, my lord.
He wore his beaver up.
What, looked he frowningly?
A countenance more In sorrow than in anger.
Pale or red?
Nay, very pale.
And fixed his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.
Very like.
Stayed it long?
Not when I saw ’t.
His beard was grizzled, no?
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.
I will watch tonight.
Perchance ‘Twill walk again.
I warrant it will.
If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all, If you have hitherto concealed this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still.
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
I will requite your loves.
So fare you well.
Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,
Your loves, as mine to you.
Farewell.
My father’s spirit in arms.
All is not well.
I doubt some foul play.
Would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul.
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.
My necessaries are embarked.
Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.
Do you doubt that?
No more but so?
Think it no more.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not.
I stay too long.
But here my father comes.
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for.
There, my blessing with thee.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
The time invites you.
Go.
Your servants tend.
‘Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Farewell.
What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Marry, well bethought.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
Affection!
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Marry, I’ll teach you.
Think yourself a baby That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly, Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus you’ll tender me a fool.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honorable fashion.
Ay, “fashion” you may call it.
Go to, go to.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.
I shall obey, my lord.
The air bites shrewdly.
It is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.
No, it is struck.
Indeed?
I heard it not.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What does this mean, my lord?
Is it a custom?
Ay, marry, is ’t.
But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.
This heavy headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition.
And indeed it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.
I’ll call thee “Hamlet,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.
” O, answer me!
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground.
But do not go with it.
No, by no means.
It will not speak.
Then I will follow it.
Do not, my lord.
Why, what should be the fear?
It waves me still.
Go on.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands.
Be ruled.
You shall not go.
My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.
Still am I called.
Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I say, away!
Go on.
I’ll follow thee.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Let’s follow.
‘Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Have after.
To what issue will this come?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let’s follow him.
Where wilt thou lead me?
Speak, I’ll go no further.
Mark me.
I will.
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.
Alas, poor ghost!
Speak.
I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.
What?
O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder?
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
What else?
And shall I couple hell?
Oh, fie!
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.
Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.
Remember thee!
My lord, my lord!
Lord Hamlet
Heaven secure him!
So be it.
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.
Come, bird, come.
How is ’t, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
Oh, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.
No.
You’ll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Nor I, my lord.
There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.
Why, right, you are in the right.
And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I’m sorry they offend you, heartily.
Yes faith, heartily.
There’s no offense, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.
What is ’t, my lord?
We will.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
Nay, but swear ’t.
In faith, my lord, not I.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Swear!
Ah, ha, boy!
Sayst thou so?
Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Propose the oath, my lord.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Hic et ubique?
Then we’ll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.
Swear by his sword.
Well said, old mole!
Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!
Once more remove, good friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Swear!
Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit!
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.
My lord, I did intend it.
Marry, well said, very well said.
Ay, very well, my lord.
“And in part him, but,” you may say, “not well.
But, if ’t be he I mean, he’s very wild.
As gaming, my lord?
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarreling, drabbing you may go so far.
My lord, that would dishonor him!
‘Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency.
But, my good lord
Wherefore should you do this?
Ay, my lord.
I would know that.
Very good, my lord.
And then, sir, does he this, he does  What was I about to say?
By the mass, I was about to say something.
Where did I leave?
At “closes in the consequence,” at “‘friend,’ Or so” and “‘gentleman.
’”
At “closes in the consequence.
” Ay, marry.
He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.
My lord, I have.
God be wi’ you.
Fare you well.
Good my lord.
Observe his inclination in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him ply his music.
Well, my lord.
Farewell.
How now, Ophelia?
What’s the matter?
O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
With what, i’ th’ name of God?
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know.
But truly, I do fear it.
What said he?
Come, go with me.
No, my good lord.
But as you did command I did repel his fetters and denied His access to me.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.
Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s “transformation” so call it Since nor th’ exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was.
Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you.
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Ay, amen!
Th’ ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord?
Oh, speak of that.
That do I long to hear.
Give first admittance to th’ ambassadors.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
I doubt it is no other but the main: His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared To be a preparation ‘gainst the Polack, But, better looked into, he truly found It was against your highness.
It likes us well, And at our more considered time we’ll read, Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well took labor.
Go to your rest.
At night we’ll feast together.
Most welcome home!
This business is well ended.
More matter, with less art.
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, ’tis true.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Good madam, stay a while.
I will be faithful.
“Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.
But how hath she received his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honorable.
I would fain prove so.
Do you think ’tis this?
It may be, very like.
Hath there been such a time I would fain know that  That I have positively said, “‘Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?
Not that I know.
Take this from this if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the center.
How may we try it further?
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind an arras then, Mark the encounter.
If he love her not And be not from his reason fall’n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters.
We will try it.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Away, I do beseech you, both away.
I’ll board him presently.
O, give me leave.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well, God ’a’ mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Excellent well.
You are a fishmonger.
Not I, my lord.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord?
Ay, sir.
To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
That’s very true, my lord.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion  Have you a daughter?
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk i’ th’ sun.
Conception is a blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive Friend, look to ’t.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.
Yet he knew me not at first.
He said I was a fishmonger.
He is far gone, far gone.
And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love, very near this.
I’ll speak to him again.
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Slanders, sir.
Though this be madness, yet there is method in ’t.
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
Into my grave.
Indeed, that is out of the air.
How pregnant sometimes his replies are.
A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.
My honorable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal except my life, except my life, except my life.
Fare you well, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.
There he is.
God save you, sir!
My honored lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do you both?
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.
Nor the soles of her shoes?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
Faith, her privates we.
In the secret parts of Fortune?
Oh, most true.
She is a strumpet.
What news?
None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.
Then is doomsday near.
But your news is not true.
Prison, my lord?
Denmark’s a prison.
Then is the world one.
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
To me it
Why then, your ambition makes it one.
‘Tis too narrow for your mind.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
No such matter.
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
What should we say, my lord?
Why, any thing, but to th’ purpose.
To what end, my lord?
That you must teach me.
What say you?
My lord, we were sent for.
I will tell you why.
So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you.
We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
He that plays the king shall be welcome.
His majesty shall have tribute of me.
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t.
What players are they?
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.
How chances it they travel?
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
Are they so followed?
No, indeed are they not.
How comes it?
Do they grow rusty?
Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace.
But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t.
What, are they children?
Who maintains ‘em?
How are they escoted?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players   , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy.
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
Is ’t possible?
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Do the boys carry it away?
Ay, that they do, my lord.
It is not very strange.
For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Your hands, come then.
Th’ appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.
Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours.
You are welcome.
But my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived.
In what, my dear lord?
I am but mad north north west.
When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Well be with you, gentlemen.
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too at each ear a hearer.
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts
Happily he’s the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players.
Mark it.
You say right, sir.
O’ Monday morning, ’twas so indeed.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome
The actors are come hither, my lord.
Buzz, buzz.
Upon my honor
Then came each actor on his ass
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral comical, historical pastoral, tragical historical, tragical comical historical pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited.
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
What a treasure had he, my lord?
Why, One fair daughter and no more, The which he lovèd passing well.
Still on my daughter.
Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
Nay, that follows not.
What follows, then, my lord?
Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was  The first row of the pious chanson will show you more, for look where my abridgement comes.
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all!
I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.
O old friend?
Why, thy face is valenced since I saw thee last.
Comest thou to beard me in Denmark?
What, my young lady and mistress!
What speech, my good lord?
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted.
Or, if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million.
‘Twas caviary to the general.
But it was as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.
‘Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks.
His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
This is too long.
It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.
Prithee, say on.
He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.
But who, ah woe, who had seen the moblèd queen
“The moblèd queen?”
That’s good.
“Moblèd queen” is good.
Look whe’e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes.
Prithee, no more.
‘Tis well.
I’ll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
God’s bodykins, man, much better.
Use every man after his desert, and who should ’scape whipping?
Use them after your own honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends.
We’ll hear a play tomorrow.
Ay, my lord.
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night.
You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t, could you not?
Ay, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
My good friends, I’ll leave you till night.
You are welcome to Elsinore.
Good my lord.
Ay, so.
Good bye to you.
Now I am alone.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
He does confess he feels himself distracted.
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded.
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.
Did you assay him?
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o’erraught on the way.
Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it.
They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
‘Tis most true, And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.
We shall, my lord.
I shall obey you .
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet’s wildness.
So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honors.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, walk you here.
Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.
Read on this book That show of such an exercise may color Your loneliness.
Oh, ’tis too true!
I hear him coming.
Let’s withdraw, my lord.
To be, or not to be?
Good my lord, How does your honor for this many a day?
I humbly thank you.
Well, well, well.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver.
I pray you now receive them.
No, not I.   I never gave you aught.
Ha, ha, are you honest?
My lord?
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.
I did love you once.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
I was the more deceived.
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
At home, my lord.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house.
Farewell.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Heavenly powers, restore him!
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough.
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.
You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.
Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!
Love?
His affections do not that way tend.
Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little, Was not like madness.
It shall do well.
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.
How now, Ophelia?
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
We heard it all.
My lord, do as you please.
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines.
I warrant your honor.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
O, reform it altogether!
How now, my lord!
Will the king hear this piece of work?
And the queen too, and that presently.
Bid the players make haste.
Will you two help to hasten them?
Ay, my lord.
What ho, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man As e’er my conversation coped withal.
O my dear lord
Nay, do not think I flatter.
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?
Why should the poor be flattered?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.
Dost thou hear?
Well, my lord.
They are coming to the play.
I must be idle.
Get you a place.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, i’ faith, of the chameleon’s dish.
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
These words are not mine.
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you played once i’ th’ university, you say?
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar.
I was killed i’ th’ Capitol.
Brutus killed me.
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.
Be the players ready?
Ay, my lord.
They stay upon your patience.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
No, good mother.
Here’s metal more attractive.
Oh, ho, do you mark that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Ay, my lord.
Do you think I meant country matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, I?
Ay, my lord.
O God, your only jig maker.
What should a man do but be merry?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables.
O heavens!
Die two months ago and not forgotten yet?
Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year.
But, by ‘r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby horse, whose epitaph is “For, oh, for, oh, the hobby horse is forgot.
”
What means this, my lord?
Marry, this is miching mallecho.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep counsel.
They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ay, or any show that you will show him.
Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.
You are naught, you are naught.
I’ll mark the play.
For us and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently.
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?
‘Tis brief, my lord.
As woman’s love.
Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbèd ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o’er ere love be done.
But woe is me!
You are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you.
Yet though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.
My operant powers their functions leave to do.
Oh, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accursed!
None wed the second but who killed the first.
Wormwood, wormwood.
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed.
If she should break it now!
‘Tis deeply sworn.
Sweet, leave me here awhile.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.
Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain.
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady protests too much, methinks.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?
Is there no offense in ’t?
No, no, they do but jest.
Poison in jest.
No offense i’ th’ world.
What do you call the play?
The Mousetrap.
Marry, how?
Tropically.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
Gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife Baptista.
You shall see anon.
‘Tis a knavish piece of work, but what o’ that?
Your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not.
Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
It would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge.
Still better and worse.
He poisons him i’ th’ garden for ’s estate.
His name’s Gonzago.
The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian.
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.
The king rises.
What, frighted with false fire?
How fares my lord?
Give o’er the play.
Give me some light, away!
Lights, lights, lights!
Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungallèd play.
For some must watch while some must sleep.
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself.
And now reigns here A very, very pajock.
You might have rhymed.
Very well, my lord.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
I did very well note him.
Ah ha!
Come, some music!
Come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Sir, a whole history.
The king, sir
Ay, sir, what of him?
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord, with choler.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor.
For, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair.
I am tame, sir.
Pronounce.
The queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
You are welcome.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment.
If not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit’s diseased.
But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command.
Or, rather, as you say, my mother.
Therefore no more but to the matter.
Then thus she says: your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration.
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?
Impart.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Have you any further trade with us?
My lord, you once did love me.
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.
Sir, I lack advancement.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?
Ay, sir, but “While the grass grows ” The proverb is something musty Oh, the recorders!
Let me see one.
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?
My lord, I cannot.
I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
It is as easy as lying.
Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.
I have not the skill.
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
God bless you, sir.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
By th’ mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then I will come to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
“By and by” is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
‘Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on.
Soft, now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature, let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
I will speak daggers to her but use none.
We will ourselves provide.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage.
For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free footed.
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home.
And, as you said    ‘Tis meet that some more audience than a mother  Since nature makes them partial should o’erhear The speech, of vantage.
Fare you well, my liege.
I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.
Thanks, dear my lord.
Oh, my offence is rank.
It smells to heaven.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.
Pray can I not.
Now might I do it pat.
Now he is a praying.
And now I’ll do ’t.
And so he goes to heaven.
And so am I revenged.
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
He will come straight.
Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your grace hath screened and stood between Much heat and him.
I’ll silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
Mother, mother, mother!
I’ll warrant you.
Fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.
Now mother, what’s the matter?
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Why, how now, Hamlet?
What’s the matter now?
Have you forgot me?
No, by the rood, not so.
You are the queen, your husband’s brother’s wife, And would it were not so!
Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.
Come, come, and sit you down.
You shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you.
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
What, ho?
Help, help, help!
How now, a rat?
Dead for a ducat, dead!
Oh, I am slain.
O me, what hast thou done?
Nay, I know not.
Is it the king?
Oh, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
A bloody deed?
Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king and marry with his brother.
As kill a king?
Ay, lady, ’twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.
I took thee for thy better.
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?
Ay me, what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
Look here upon this picture and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow?
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grainèd spots As will not leave their tinct.
Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed, Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty
O, speak to me no more!
These words like daggers enter in my ears.
No more, sweet Hamlet.
A murderer and a villain, A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord, a vice of kings, A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket
No more!
A king of shreds and patches
Save me and hover o’er me with your wings, You heavenly guards!
What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he’s mad!
Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command?
O, say!
Do not forget.
This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O, step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
How is it with you, lady?
Alas, how is ’t with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?
On him, on him!
Look you, how pale he glares!
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.
Nor did you nothing hear?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look you there!
This the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.
Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music.
It is not madness That I have uttered.
Bring me to the test, And I the matter will reword, which madness Would gambol from.
Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Oh, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half.
Good night but go not to mine uncle’s bed.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.
What shall I do?
I must to England, you know that?
Alack, I had forgot.
‘Tis so concluded on.
There’s letters sealed, and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged, They bear the mandate.
They must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery.
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.
There’s matter in these sighs, these profound heaves.
You must translate.
‘Tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How does Hamlet?
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier.
In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries, “A rat, a rat!
” And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man.
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all  To you yourself, to us, to everyone.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
O Gertrude, come away!
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him.
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I pray you, haste in this.
Safely stowed.
Hamlet!
But soft, what noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?
Oh, here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
Do not believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!
What replication should be made by the son of a king?
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities.
But such officers do the king best service in the end.
He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to be last swallowed.
When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
I understand you not, my lord.
I am glad of it.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king.
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
The king is a thing
A thing, my lord?
Of nothing.
Bring me to him.
Hide, fox, and all after.
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He’s loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes.
And where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed, But never the offense.
To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause.
Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all.
How now, what hath befall’n?
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him.
But where is he?
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
At supper.
At supper where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him.
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.
Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes, but to one table.
That’s the end.
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
What dost you mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send hither to see.
If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ th’ other place yourself.
But if indeed you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
Go seek him there.
He will stay till ye come.
For England?
Ay, Hamlet.
Good.
So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.
I see a cherub that sees them.
But come, for England.
Farewell, dear mother.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
My mother.
Father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.
Come, for England!
Follow him at foot.
Tempt him with speed aboard.
Delay it not.
I’ll have him hence tonight.
I will do ’t, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose powers are these?
They are of Norway, sir.
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it.
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Yes, it is already garrisoned.
God be wi’ you, sir.
Will ’t please you go, my lord?
I’ll be with you straight.
Go a little before.
How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge!
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, Indeed distract.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father, says she hears There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection.
‘Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds.
Let her come in.
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
How now, Ophelia?
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Say you?
Nay, pray you, mark.
Nay, but, Ophelia
Pray you, mark.
Alas, look here, my lord.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God’ield you!
They say the owl was a baker’s daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
Conceit upon her father.
Pray you, let’s have no words of this, but when they ask you what it means, say you this:
Pretty Ophelia
Indeed, without an oath I’ll make an end on ’t:
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i’ th’ cold ground.
Follow her close.
Give her good watch, I pray you.
Oh, this is the poison of deep grief.
It springs All from her father’s death, and now behold!
Alack, what noise is this?
Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?
Save yourself, my lord.
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
The doors are broke.
Where is this king?
Sirs, stand you all without.
No, let’s come in!
I pray you, give me leave.
We will, we will.
I thank you.
Keep the door.
O thou vile king, Give me my father!
Calmly, good Laertes.
What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant like?
Let him go, Gertrude.
Do not fear our person.
There’s such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will.
Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed.
Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
Where is my father?
Dead.
But not by him.
Let him demand his fill.
How came he dead?
I’ll not be juggled with.
To hell, allegiance!
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation.
To this point I stand That both the worlds I give to negligence.
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world.
And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms And, like the kind life rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.
Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman.
How now?
What noise is that?
O heat, dry up my brains!
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam.
O rose of May, Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens, is ’t possible a young maid’s wits Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.
You must sing A down a down And you, Call him a  down a Oh, how the wheel becomes it!
It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.
This nothing’s more than matter.
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.
Pray you, love, remember.
And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.
There’s fennel for you, and columbines.
There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me.
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favor and to prettiness.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.
Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
Let this be so.
His means of death, his obscure funeral  No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation  Cry to be heard as ’twere from heaven to earth, That I must call ’t in question.
So you shall.
And where the offense is, let the great ax fall.
I pray you, go with me.
What are they that would speak with me?
Seafaring men, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them come in.
I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless thee too.
He shall, sir, an ’t please him.
“Horatio, When thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king.
They have letters for him.
Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase.
Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.
On the instant, they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner.
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
It well appears.
But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So criminal and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirred up.
Oh, for two special reasons, Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed, But yet to me they are strong.
Break not your sleeps for that.
You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime.
You shortly shall hear more.
I loved your father, and we love ourself.
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine
How now, what news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This to your majesty, this to the queen.

From Hamlet?
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say.
I saw them not.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
“High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
Hamlet.
” What should this mean?
Are all the rest come back?
Know you the hand?
‘Tis Hamlet’s character.
“Naked”?
And in a postscript here, he says “alone.
” Can you advise me?
I’m lost in it, my lord.
But let him come.
It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, “Thus diddest thou.
”
If it be so, Laertes  As how should it be so?
How otherwise?
Will you be ruled by me?
Ay, my lord  So you will not o’errule me to a peace.
To thine own peace.
If he be now returned, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my devise, Under the which he shall not choose but fall.
It falls right.
You have been talked of since your travel much  And that in Hamlet’s hearing for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine.
Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.
What part is that, my lord?
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness.
Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback.
A Norman was ’t?
A Norman.
Upon my life, Lamond!
The very same.
I know him well.
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.
What out of this, my lord?
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?
Why ask you this?
Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
To cut his throat i’ th’ church.
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize.
Revenge should have no bounds.
But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet returned shall know you are come home.
I will do ’t.
Let’s further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape.
Drowned?
Oh, where?
There is a willow grows aslant a brook That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do “dead men’s fingers” call them.
Alas, then she is drowned.
Drowned, drowned.
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears.
But yet It is our trick.
Nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will.
When these are gone, The woman will be out.
Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze, But that this folly doubts it.
Let’s follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again.
Therefore let’s follow.
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell thee she is.
Therefore make her grave straight.
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?
Why, ’tis found so.
It must be se offendendo.
It cannot be else.
For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act.
And an act hath three branches it is to act, to do, to perform.
Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver
Give me leave.
Here lies the water.
Good.
But is this law?
Ay, marry, is ’t.
Crowner’s quest law.
Will you ha’ the truth on ’t?
If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.
Why, there thou sayst.
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian.
Come, my spade.
There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave makers.
They hold up Adam’s profession.
Was he a gentleman?
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Why, he had none.
What, art a heathen?
How dost thou understand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another question to thee.
If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself
Go to.
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
like thy wit well, in good faith.
The gallows does well, but how does it well?
“Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?”
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Marry, now I can tell.
To ’t.
Mass, I cannot tell.
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
Has this fellow no feeling of his business?
He sings at grave  making.
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
‘Tis e’en so.
The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once.
How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!
It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God, might it not?
It might, my lord.
Or of a courtier, which could say, “Good morrow, sweet lord!
” “How dost thou, good lord?” This might be my Lord Such a one that praised my Lord Such a one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?
Ay, my lord.
Why, e’en so.
There’s another.
Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddities now, his quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ay, my lord, and of calfskins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.
I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave’s this, sirrah?
Mine, sir.
I think it be thine, indeed, for thou liest in ’t.
You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in ’t, and yet it is mine.
Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine.
‘Tis for the dead, not for the quick.
Therefore thou liest.
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman, then?
For none, neither.
Who is to be buried in ’t?
One that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she’s dead.
How absolute the knave is!
We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of it.
Of all the days i’ the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born, he that is mad and sent into England.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Why, because he was mad.
Why?
‘Twill not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.
How “strangely?”
Faith, e’en with losing his wits.
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere he rot?
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in  he will last you some eight year or nine year.
A tanner will last you nine year.
Why he more than another?
Whose was it?
A whoreson mad fellow’s it was.
Whose do you think it was?
Nay, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!
He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the king’s jester.
This?
E’en that.
Let me see.
Alas, poor Yorick!
What’s that, my lord?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’ earth?
E’en so.
And smelt so?
Pah!
E’en so, my lord.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
‘Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
No, faith, not a jot.
What ceremony else?
That is Laertes, a very noble youth, mark.
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty.
Must there no more be done?
No more be done.
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace parted souls.
Lay her i’ th’ earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.
What, the fair Ophelia?
Sweets to the sweet.
Farewell!
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife.
I thought thy bride bed to have decked, sweet maid, And not have strewed thy grave.
Oh, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, T’ o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.
What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder wounded hearers?
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!
Thou pray’st not well.
Pluck them asunder.
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Gentlemen
Good my lord, be quiet.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?
O, he is mad, Laertes.
For love of God, forbear him.
‘Swounds, show me what thou’lt do.
This is mere madness.
And thus a while the fit will work on him.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.
Hear you, sir.
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever.
But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech.
We’ll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument.
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
So much for this, sir.
Now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstances?
Remember it, my lord?
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.
That is most certain.
Is ’t possible?
Here’s the commission.
Read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
I beseech you.
Being thus benetted round with villainies  Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
Ay, good my lord.
How was this sealed?
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal.
Folded the writ up in form of th’ other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th’ impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.
Now, the next day Was our sea fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
They are not near my conscience.
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.
‘Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites.
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.
It will be short.
The interim’s mine.
And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.
Peace.
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Dost know this water fly?
No, my good lord.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty.
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.
Put your bonnet to his right use.
‘Tis for the head.
I thank your lordship.
It is very hot.
No, believe me, ’tis very cold.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord.
It is very sultry as ’twere I cannot tell how.
My lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.
Sir, this is the matter
I beseech you, remember
Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
Sir?
Is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do ’t, sir, really.
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
His purse is empty already.
All ’s golden words are spent.
Of him, sir.
I know you are not ignorant
I would you did, sir.
Yet in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me.
Well, sir?
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
What’s his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.
That’s two of his weapons.
But well.
What call you the carriages?
I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
He hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
How if I answer “No”?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.
If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me.
Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose.
I will win for him an I can.
If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
Shall I redeliver you e’en so?
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
He does well to commend it himself.
There are no tongues else for ’s turn.
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it.
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall.
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
I am constant to my purpose.
They follow the king’s pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
The king and queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
She well instructs me.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I do not think so.
Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart.
But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord
It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
Not a whit.
We defy augury.
There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.
If it be now, ’tis not to come.
If it be not to come, it will be now.
If it be not now, yet it will come the readiness is all.
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

Give me your pardon, sir.
I’ve done you wrong.
But pardon ’t, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punished With sore distraction.
What I have done, That might your nature, honor, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not.
Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then?
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge.
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored.
But till that time I do receive your offered love like love And will not wrong it.
I embrace it freely, And will this brother’s wager frankly play.
Give us the foils.
Come, one for me.
I’ll be your foil, Laertes.
In mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i’ th’ darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.
You mock me, sir.
No, by this hand.
Give them the foils, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
Very well, my lord.
Your grace hath laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side.
I do not fear it.
I have seen you both.
But since he is better we have therefore odds.
This is too heavy.
Let me see another.
This likes me well.
These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire!
The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn.
Give me the cups.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judgment?
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Well, again.
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is thine.
Here’s to thy health.
Give him the cup.
I’ll play this bout first.
Set it by a while.
Come.
Another hit.
What say you?
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.
Our son shall win.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Good madam.
Gertrude, do not drink.
I will, my lord.
I pray you, pardon me.
It is the poisoned cup.
It is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam.
By and by.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
My lord, I’ll hit him now.
I do not think ’t.
And yet it is almost ‘gainst my conscience.
Come, for the third, Laertes.
You do but dally.
I pray you, pass with your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
Say you so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
Have at you now!
Part them!
They are incensed.
Nay, come, again.
Look to the queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides.
How is it, my lord?
How is ’t, Laertes?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
How does the queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.
No, no, the drink, the drink!
O my dear Hamlet!
The drink, the drink!
I am poisoned.
O villainy!
Ho, let the door be locked.
Treachery!
Seek it out.
It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slain.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed.
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Thy mother’s poisoned.
I can no more.
The king, the king’s to blame.
The point envenomed too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
Treason!
Treason!
O, yet defend me, friends.
I am but hurt.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damnèd Dane, Drink off this potion.
Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
He is justly served.
It is a poison tempered by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.
Heaven make thee free of it.
I follow thee.
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Here’s yet some liquor left.
As thou’rt a man, Give me the cup.
Let go!
By heaven, I’ll have ’t.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To th’ ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.
O, I die, Horatio.
The potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from England.
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
He has my dying voice.
So tell him, with th’ occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited.
The rest is silence.
O, O, O, O.
Now cracks a noble heart.
Where is this sight?
What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
This quarry cries on havoc.
O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
Not from his mouth, Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placèd to the view, And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world How these things came about.
Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently performed, Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
This matched with other did, my gracious lord.
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend, Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
Stained with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited; Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights, Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see On Holmedon’s plains .
Of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife, and eldest son To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
And is not this an honorable spoil?
A gallant prize?
Ha, cousin, is it not?
In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
This is his uncle’s teaching.
But I have sent for him to answer this.
And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we Will hold at Windsor.
I will, my liege.
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
Thou art so fat witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day?
What, none?
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.
Well, how then?
Come, roundly, roundly.
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty.
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad.
And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.
And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
How now, how now, mad wag?
What, in thy quips and thy quiddities?
What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
No, I’ll give thee thy due.
Thou hast paid all there.
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent  But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king?
And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law?
Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt.
Shall I?
O rare!
By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.
Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.
For obtaining of suits?
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe.
'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moorditch?
Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and art indeed the most comparative, rascaliest, sweet young prince.
But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity.
I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought.
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it.
O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint.
Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it.
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
Zounds, where thou wilt, lad.
I’ll make one.
An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.
I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse taking.
Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal.
'Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.
Good morrow, Ned.
Good morrow, sweet Hal.
What says Monsieur Remorse?
What says Sir John Sack and Sugar?
Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?
Sir John stands to his word.
The devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs.
He will give the devil his due.
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.
You will, chops?
Hal, wilt thou make one?
Who, I rob?
I a thief?
not I, by my faith.
There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.
Why, that’s well said.
Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.
By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then when thou art king.
I care not.
Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone.
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.
Farewell, thou latter spring.
Farewell, All hallown summer.
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow.
I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone.
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves.
Tut, our horses they shall not see; I’ll tie them in the wood.
Our vizards we will change after we leave them.
And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
Well, I’ll go with thee.
Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap.
There I’ll sup.
Farewell.
Farewell, my lord.
I know you all, and will awhile uphold The unyoked humor of your idleness.
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves The scourge of greatness to be used on it, And that same greatness too which our own hands Have holp to make so portly.
My lord
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory, And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us.
When we need Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
You were about to speak.
Yea, my good lord.
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
Revolted Mortimer!
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege, But by the chance of war.
Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him.
An if the devil come and roar for them, I will not send them.
I will after straight And tell him so, for I will ease my heart, Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
What, drunk with choler?
stay and pause awhile.
Here comes your uncle.
Speak of Mortimer?
Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul Want mercy if I do not join with him.
Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
I cannot blame him.
Was not he proclaimed By Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?
He was; I heard the proclamation.
And then it was when the unhappy King  Whose wrongs in us God pardon!
But soft, I pray you.
He did; myself did hear it.
Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin King That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
Peace, cousin, say no more.
If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!
Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
He apprehends a world of figures here, But not the form of what he should attend.
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
I cry you mercy.
Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners
I’ll keep them all.
You start away And lend no ear unto my purposes: Those prisoners you shall keep
Nay, I will.
That’s flat!
He said he would not ransom Mortimer, Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer.
But I will find him when he lies asleep, And in his ear I’ll hollo “Mortimer.
” Nay, I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but “Mortimer,” and give it him To keep his anger still in motion.
Hear you, cousin, a word.
Why, what a wasp stung and impatient fool Art thou to break into this woman’s mood, Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods, Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
In Richard’s time what do you call the place?
A plague upon it!
It is in Gloucestershire.
At Berkley Castle.
You say true.
Nay, if you have not, to it again.
We will stay your leisure.
I have done, i' faith.
Of York, is it not?
True; who bears hard His brother’s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
I smell it.
Upon my life, it will do well.
Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
And then the power of Scotland and of York To join with Mortimer, ha?
And so they shall.
In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.
He does, he does.
We’ll be revenged on him.
Cousin, farewell.
No further go in this Than I by letters shall direct your course.
Farewell, good brother.
We shall thrive, I trust.
Anon, anon.
I prithee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle.
Put a few flocks in the point.
Poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.
Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose.
It was the death of him.
I think this be the most villanous house in all London road for fleas.
I am stung like a tench.
Like a tench?
By the Mass, there is ne'er a king christen could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.
Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we leak in your chimney, and your chamber lye breeds fleas like a loach.
What, ostler, come away and be hanged.
Come away.
I have a gammon of bacon and two races of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing Cross.
God’s body, the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.
What, ostler!
A plague on thee!
Hast thou never an eye in thy head?
Canst not hear?
An ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate on thee, I am a very villain.
Come, and be hanged.
Hast no faith in thee?
Good morrow, carriers.
What’s o'clock?
I think it be two o'clock.
I prithee, lend me thy lantern to see my gelding in the stable.
Nay, by God, soft.
I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
I pray thee, lend me thine.
Ay, when, canst tell?
“Lend me thy lantern,” quoth he.
Marry, I’ll see thee hanged first.
Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee.
Come, neighbour Mugs, we’ll call up the gentlemen.
They will along with company, for they have great charge.
What ho, chamberlain!
At hand, quoth pickpurse.
That’s even as fair as “at hand, quoth the Chamberlain,” for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from laboring: thou layest the plot how.
Good morrow, Master Gadshill.
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.
No, I’ll none of it.
What talkest thou to me of the hangman?
If I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling.
What, the commonwealth their boots?
Will she hold out water in foul way?
She will, she will.
Justice hath liquored her.
We steal as in a castle, cocksure.
We have the receipt of fern seed; we walk invisible.
Give me thy hand.
Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as I am a true man.
Nay, rather let me have it as you are a false thief.
Go to.
Homo is a common name to all men.
Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable.
Farewell, you muddy knave.
Come, shelter, shelter!
I have removed Falstaff’s horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
Stand close.
Poins!
Poins, and be hanged!
Poins!
Peace, you fat kidneyed rascal.
What a brawling dost thou keep!
Where’s Poins, Hal?
He is walked up to the top of the hill.
I’ll go seek him.
I am accursed to rob in that thief’s company.
The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know not where.
If I travel but four foot by the square further afoot, I shall break my wind.
Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I ’scape hanging for killing that rogue.
I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the rogue’s company.
If the rascal hath not given me medicines to make me love him, I’ll be hanged.
It could not be else: I have drunk medicines.
Poins!
Hal!
A plague upon you both.
Bardolph!
Peto!
Peace, you fat guts!
Lie down, lay thine ear close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of travelers.
Have you any levers to lift me up again being down?
'Sblood, I’ll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father’s Exchequer.
What a plague mean you to colt me thus?
Thou liest.
Thou art not colted; thou art uncolted.
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s son.
Out, you rogue!
Shall I be your ostler?
Hang thyself in thine own heir apparent garters!
If I be ta'en, I’ll peach for this.
Stand.
So I do, against my will.
O, ’tis our setter.
I know his voice, Bardolph.
What news?
Case you, case you.
On with your vizards.
You lie, you rogue.
'Tis going to the King’s Tavern.
There’s enough to make us all.
To be hanged.
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane.
Ned Poins and I will walk lower.
If they ’scape from your encounter, then they light on us.
How many be there of them?
Some eight or ten.
Zounds, will they not rob us?
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather, but yet no coward, Hal.
Well, we leave that to the proof.
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge.
When thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
Farewell, and stand fast.
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
Ned, where are our disguises?
Here, hard by.
Stand close.
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I.
Every man to his business.
Stand!
Jesus bless us!
Strike!
Down with them!
Cut the villains' throats!
O, we are undone, both we and ours forever!
Hang, you gorbellied knaves!
Are you undone?
No, you fat chuffs.
I would your store were here.
On, bacons, on!
What, you knaves, young men must live.
You are grandjurors, are you?
We’ll jure you, faith.
The thieves have bound the true men.
Stand close, I hear them coming.
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there’s no equity stirring.
There’s no more valor in that Poins than in a wild duck.
Your money!
Villains!
Got with much ease.
Now merrily to horse.
The thieves are all scattered, and possessed with fear So strongly that they dare not meet each other.
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Away, good Ned.
Falstaff sweats to death, And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
Were ’t not for laughing, I should pity him.
How the fat rogue roared!
But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.
He could be contented; why is he not, then?
In respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house.
Let me see some more.
The purpose you undertake is dangerous.
O my good lord, why are you thus alone?
For what offense have I this fortnight been A banished woman from my Harry’s bed?
Tell me, sweet lord, what is ’t that takes from thee Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth And start so often when thou sit’st alone?
What, ho!
He is, my lord, an hour ago.
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
What horse?
A roan, a crop ear, is it not?
It is, my lord.
That roan shall be my throne.
Well, I will back him straight.
O, Esperance!
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
But hear you, my lord.
What say’st thou, my lady?
What is it carries you away?
Why, my horse, My love, my horse.
Out, you mad headed ape!
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen As you are tossed with.
In faith, I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will.
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir About his title, and hath sent for you To line his enterprise; but if you go
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me Directly unto this question that I ask.
In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry, An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
Away!
Away, you trifler.
Love, I love thee not.
I care not for thee, Kate.
This is no world To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.
We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns, And pass them current too.
Do you not love me?
Do you not indeed?
Well, do not then, for since you love me not, I will not love myself.
Do you not love me?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when I am a horseback, I will swear I love thee infinitely.
How?
So far?
Not an inch further.
But hark you, Kate, Whither I go, thither shall you go too.
Today will I set forth, tomorrow you.
Will this content you, Kate?
It must, of force.
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.
Where hast been, Hal?
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads.
I have sounded the very bass string of humility.
Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
Francis!
Thou art perfect.
Francis!
Come hither, Francis.
My lord?
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
Forsooth, five years, and as much as to
Francis!
Anon, anon, sir.
Five year!
By 'r lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter!
O Lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart
Francis!
Anon, sir.
How old art thou, Francis?
Let me see.
About Michaelmas next, I shall be
Francis!
Anon, sir.
Pray, stay a little, my lord.
O Lord, I would it had been two!
I will give thee for it a thousand pound.
Ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
Francis!
Anon, anon.
Anon, Francis?
No, Francis, but tomorrow, Francis; or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt.
But, Francis
My lord?
O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink, for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully.
What, sir?
Francis!
Away, you rogue!
Dost thou not hear them call?
Why are you standing there doing nothing when you hear people are calling your name?
Sir, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door.
Anon, anon, sir.
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman!
Welcome, Jack.
Where hast thou been?
You rogue, here’s lime in this sack too.
There is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man, yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it.
A villanous coward!
Go thy ways, old Jack.
Die when thou wilt.
If manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten herring.
There lives not three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is fat and grows old, God help the while.
A bad world, I say.
I would I were a weaver.
A King’s son!
If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese, I’ll never wear hair on my face more.
You, Prince of Wales!
Why, you whoreson round man, what’s the matter?
Are not you a coward?
Answer me to that and Poins there?
Zounds, ye fat paunch, an you call me coward, by the Lord, I’ll stab thee.
I call thee coward?
All is one for that.
A plague of all cowards, still say I.
What’s the matter?
What’s the matter?
There be four of us here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
Where is it, Jack?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Taken from us it is.
A hundred upon poor four of us.
What, a hundred, man?
I am a rogue if I were not at half sword with a dozen of them two hours together.
I have ’scaped by miracle.
I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut through and through, my sword hacked like a handsaw.
Ecce signum!
I never dealt better since I was a man.
All would not do.
A plague of all cowards!
Speak, sirs, how was it?
We four set upon some dozen.
Sixteen at least, my lord.
And bound them.
No, no, they were not bound.
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us.
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
What, fought you with them all?
All?
I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish.
If there were not two  or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two legged creature.
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
Nay, that’s past praying for.
I have peppered two of them.
Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits.
I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.
Thou knowest my old ward.
Here I lay, and thus I bore my point.
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.
What, four?
Thou saidst but two even now.
Four, Hal, I told thee four.
Ay, ay, he said four.
These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me.
I made me no more ado, but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
Seven?
Why there were but four even now.
In buckram?
Ay, four in buckram suits.
Prithee, let him alone.
We shall have more anon.
Dost thou hear me, Hal?
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
Do so, for it is worth the listening to.
These nine in buckram that I told thee of
So, two more already.
Their points being broken
Down fell their hose.
Began to give me ground, but I followed me close, came in foot and hand, and with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid.
O monstrous!
Eleven buckram men grown out of two!
What, art thou mad?
Art thou mad?
Is not the truth the truth?
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand?
Come, tell us your reason.
What sayest thou to this?
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
What, upon compulsion?
I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin.
This sanguine coward, this bed presser, this horseback breaker, this huge hill of flesh
Mark, Jack.
We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were masters of their wealth.
Mark now how a plain tale shall put you down.
Come, let’s hear, Jack.
What trick hast thou now?
By the Lord, I knew you as well as he that made you.
Why, hear you, my masters, was it for me to kill the heir apparent?
Should I turn upon the true Prince?
Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules, but beware instinct.
The lion will not touch the true Prince.
Instinct is a great matter.
I was now a coward on instinct.
I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my life I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true Prince.
But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.
Hostess, clap to the doors.
Watch tonight, pray to morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you.
What, shall we be merry?
hall we have a play extempore?
Content, and the argument shall be thy running away.
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me.
O Jesu, my lord the Prince!
How now, my lady the hostess, what sayest thou to me?
Give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him back again to my mother.
What manner of man is he?
An old man.
What doth Gravity out of his bed at midnight?
Shall I give him his answer?
Prithee do, Jack.
Faith, and I’ll send him packing.
Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s sword so hacked?
O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore.
Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou ran’st away.
My lord, do you see these meteors?
Do you behold these exhalations?
I do.
What think you they portend?
Hot livers and cold purses.
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
My own knee?
When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist.
I could have crept into any alderman’s thumb ring.
A plague of sighing and grief!
It blows a man up like a bladder.
There’s villanous news abroad.
Here was Sir John Bracy from your father.
You must to the court in the morning.
That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold, and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook what a plague call you him?
Owen Glendower.
He that rides at high speed, and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.
You have hit it.
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him.
He will not run.
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
Why, then, it is like if there come a hot June, and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob nails, by the hundreds.
By the Mass, thou sayest true.
It is like we shall have good trading that way.
But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard?
Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower?
Art thou not horribly afraid?
Doth not thy blood thrill at it?
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father.
If thou love me, practice an answer.
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life.
Shall I?
Content.
This chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter, and this cushion my crown.
Thy state is taken for a joined stool, thy golden scepter for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown.
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved.
Well, here is my leg.
And here is my speech.
Stand aside, nobility.
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.
O the father, how he holds his countenance!
For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful queen, For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.
O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see.
Peace, good pint pot.
Peace, good tickle brain.
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied.
For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, so youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears.
What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
Dost thou speak like a king?
Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father.
Depose me?
If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit sucker or a poulter’s hare.
Well, here I am set.
And here I stand.
Judge, my masters.
Now, Harry, whence come you?
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
'Sblood, my lord, they are false.
Nay, I’ll tickle you for a young prince, i' faith.
Swearest thou?
Ungracious boy, henceforth ne'er look on me.
Thou art violently carried away from grace.
There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man.
A tun of man is thy companion.
Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors, that bolting hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years?
Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it?
Wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it?
Wherein cunning but in craft?
Wherein crafty but in villany?
I would your Grace would take me with you.
Whom means your Grace?
That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white bearded Satan.
My lord, the man I know.
I know thou dost.
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know.
That he is old, the more the pity; his white hairs do witness it.
But that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny.
If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked.
If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned.
If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved.
I do, I will.
O, my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door.
Out, you rogue.
Play out the play.
I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
O Jesu, my lord, my lord
Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick.
What’s the matter?
The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door.
They are come to search the house.
Shall I let them in?
Dost thou hear, Hal?
And thou a natural coward without instinct.
I deny your major.
If you will deny the Sheriff, so; if not, let him enter.
If I become not a cart as well as
Go, hide thee behind the arras.
The rest walk up above.
Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.
Both which I have had, but their date is out; and therefore I’ll hide me.
Call in the Sheriff.
First pardon me, my lord.
A hue and cry Hath followed certain men unto this house.
What men?
One of them is well known, my gracious lord, A gross fat man.
As fat as butter.
The man, I do assure you is not here, For I myself at this time have employed him.
And, Sheriff, I will engage my word to thee That I will by tomorrow dinner time Send him to answer thee or any man For any thing he shall be charged withal.
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
I will, my lord.
There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
It may be so.
If he have robbed these men, He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
Good night, my noble lord.
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s.
Go call him forth.
Falstaff!
Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.
Hark, how hard he fetches breath.
Search his pockets.
Nothing but papers, my lord.
Let’s see what they be.
Read them.
O monstrous!
But one halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack!
Good morrow, good my lord.
These promises are fair, the parties sure, And our induction full of prosperous hope.
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower, Will you sit down?
And Uncle Worcester  A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.
No, here it is.
And you in hell, As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
I cannot blame him.
At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward.
Why, so it would have done At the same season if your mother’s cat Had but kittened, though yourself had never been born.
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
And I say the earth was not of my mind, If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
The heavens were all on fire; the earth did tremble.
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, And not in fear of your nativity.
Cousin, of many men I do not bear these crossings.
I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh.
I’ll to dinner.
Peace, cousin Percy.
You will make him mad.
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil By telling truth.
Tell truth and shame the devil.
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
How ’scapes he agues, in the devil’s name?
Come, here’s the map.
Shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta'en?
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, In quantity equals not one of yours.
See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge half moon, a monstrous cantle out.
I’ll have the current in this place dammed up, And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel, fair and evenly.
It shall not wind with such a deep indent, To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
Not wind?
It shall, it must.
You see it doth.
Yea, but Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up With like advantage on the other side, Gelding the opposèd continent as much As on the other side it takes from you.
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land, And then he runs straight and even.
I’ll have it so.
A little charge will do it.
I’ll not have it altered.
Will not you?
No, nor you shall not.
Who shall say me nay?
Why, that will I.
Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
Come, you shall have Trent turned.
I do not care.
The moon shines fair.
Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father!
I cannot choose.
Well, I am schooled.
Good manners be your speed!
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
This is the deadly spite that angers me: My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
My daughter weeps; she’ll not part with you.
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
I understand thy looks.
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
O, I am ignorance itself in this!
With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing.
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down.
Come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
Go, you giddy goose.
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh, And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous.
By 'r Lady, he is a good musician.
Then should you be nothing but musical, for you are altogether governed by humors.
Lie still, you thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
No.
Then be still.
Now God help thee!
To the Welsh lady’s bed.
What’s that?
Peace, she sings.
Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too.
Not mine, in good sooth.
Not yours, in good sooth!
Heart, you swear like a comfit maker’s wife!
I will not sing.
'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red breast teacher.
An the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two hours, and so come in when ye will.
Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
By this our book is drawn.
We’ll but seal, And then to horse immediately.
With all my heart.
God pardon thee.
Yet let me wonder, Harry, At thy affections, which do hold a wing Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord, Be more myself.
Do not think so.
You shall not find it so.
And God forgive them that so much have swayed Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me.
So hath the business that I come to speak of.
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word That Douglas and the English rebels met The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.
A mighty and a fearful head they are, If promises be kept on every hand, As ever offered foul play in the state.
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action?
Do I not bate?
Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
Why, there is it.
Come sing me a bawdy song, make me merry.
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life.
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s head or a memento mori .
I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his robes, burning, burning.
If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would
You lie, hostess.
Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair; and I’ll be sworn my pocket was picked.
Go to, you are a woman, go.
Who, I?
No; I defy thee!
God’s light, I was never called so in mine own house before.
Go to, I know you well enough.
No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John.
I know you, Sir John.
Dowlas, filthy dowlas.
He had his part of it.
Let him pay.
He?
Alas, he is poor.
He hath nothing.
How, poor?
Look upon his face.
What call you rich?
O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!
How?
The Prince is a jack, a sneak up.
'Sblood, an he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
My lord, I pray you, hear me.
What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly?
How doth thy husband?
I love him well; he is an honest man.
Good my lord, hear me.
Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
What say’st thou, Jack?
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had my pocket picked.
This house is turned bawdy house; they pick pockets.
What didst thou lose, Jack?
A trifle, some eightpenny matter.
So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so.
And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul mouthed man as he is; and said he would cudgel you.
What, he did not!
There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
Say, what thing, what thing?
What thing!
Why, a thing to thank God on.
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it!
I am an honest man’s wife, and, setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
What beast?
Why, an otter.
An otter, Sir John.
Why an otter?
Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.
Thou art an unjust man in saying so.
Thou or any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou.
Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.
So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you owed him a thousand pound.
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
A thousand pound, Hal?
A million.
Thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.
Nay, my lord, he called you “jack,” and said he would cudgel you.
Did I, Bardolph?
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
I say ’tis copper.
Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
And why not as the lion?
The King is to be feared as the lion.
Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father?
Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees!
But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine.
It is all filled up with guts and midriff.
Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket?
Dost thou hear, Hal?
Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villany?
Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty.
You confess, then, you picked my pocket?
It appears so by the story.
Hostess, I forgive thee.
O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee.
The money is paid back again.
I am good friends with my father and may do anything.
Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou dost, and do it with unwashed hands too.
Do, my lord.
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
I would it had been of horse.
Where shall I find one that can steal well?
O, for a fine thief of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts!
I am heinously unprovided.
Well, God be thanked for these rebels.
They offend none but the virtuous.
I laud them; I praise them.
Bardolph!
My lord.
Rare words, brave world!
Hostess, my breakfast, come.
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum.
Well said, my noble Scot.
Do so, and ’tis well.
These letters come from your father.
Letters from him!
Why comes he not himself?
He cannot come, my lord.
Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sick In such a justling time?
Who leads his power?
Under whose government come they along?
His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited.
His health was never better worth than now.
Sick now?
Droop now?
This sickness doth infect The very lifeblood of our enterprise.
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.
A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off!
And yet, in faith, it is not.
His present want Seems more than we shall find it.
Were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast?
To set so rich a main On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
It were not good, for therein should we read The very bottom and the soul of hope, The very list, the very utmost bound Of all our fortunes.
Faith, and so we should, where now remains A sweet reversion.
We may boldly spend Upon the hope of what is to come in.
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto, If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
But yet I would your father had been here.
The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division.
It will be thought By some that know not why he is away That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.
And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction And breed a kind of question in our cause.
You strain too far.
As heart can think.
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
No harm, what more?
And further I have learned, The King himself in person is set forth, Or hitherwards intended speedily, With strong and mighty preparation.
He shall be welcome too.
Where is his son, The nimble footed madcap Prince of Wales, And his comrades, that daffed the world aside And bid it pass?
No more, no more!
There is more news.
I learned in Worcester, as I rode along, He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
What may the King’s whole battle reach unto?
To thirty thousand.
Forty let it be.
My father and Glendower being both away, The powers of us may serve so great a day.
Come, let us take a muster speedily.
Doomsday is near.
Die all, die merrily.
Talk not of dying.
I am out of fear Of death or death’s hand for this one half year.
Will you give me money, captain?
Lay out, lay out.
This bottle makes an angel.
An if it do, take it for thy labor.
I will, captain.
Farewell.
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet.
I have misused the King’s press damnably.
How now, blown Jack?
How now, quilt?
What, Hal, how now, mad wag?
What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire?
Faith, Sir John, ’tis more than time that I were there and you too, but my powers are there already.
The King, I can tell you, looks for us all.
We must away all night.
Tut, never fear me.
I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.
I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter.
But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after?
Mine, Hal, mine.
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder.
They’ll fill a pit as well as better.
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.
Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me.
No, I’ll be sworn, unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare.
But, sirrah, make haste.
Percy is already in the field.
What, is the King encamped?
He is, Sir John.
I fear we shall stay too long.
Well, To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
We’ll fight with him tonight.
It may not be.
You give him then advantage.
Not a whit.
Why say you so?
Looks he not for supply?
So do we.
His is certain; ours is doubtful.
Good cousin, be advised.
Stir not tonight.
Do not, my lord.
You do not counsel well.
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
Do me no slander, Douglas.
Yea, or tonight.
Content.
Tonight, say I.
Come, come it nay not be.
I wonder much, Being men of such great leading as you are, That you foresee not what impediments Drag back our expedition.
Certain horse Of my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up.
So are the horses of the enemy In general journey bated and brought low.
The better part of ours are full of rest.
The number of the King exceedeth ours.
For God’s sake, cousin, stay till all come in.
And God defend but still I should stand so, So long as out of limit and true rule You stand against anointed majesty.
But to my charge.
The king hath sent to know The nature of your griefs, and whereupon You conjure from the breast of civil peace Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land Audacious cruelty.
The King is kind, and well we know the king Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
Tut, I came not to hear this.
Then to the point.
Shall I return this answer to the King?
Not so, Sir Walter.
We’ll withdraw awhile.
I would you would accept of grace and love.
And maybe so we shall.
Pray God you do.
My good lord, I guess their tenor.
Like enough you do.
Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch.
For, sir, at Shrewsbury, As I am truly given to understand, The King with mighty and quick raisèd power Meets with Lord Harry.
Why, my good lord, you need not fear.
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
No, Mortimer is not there.
And so there is.
But yet the King hath drawn The special head of all the land together: The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt, And many more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms.
Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon busky hill.
Then with the losers let it sympathize, For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
You have not sought it?
How comes it then?
Peace, chewet, peace.
In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial.
Tell your nephew, The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy.
By my hopes, This present enterprise set off his head, I do not think a braver gentleman, More active valiant, or more valiant young, More daring or more bold, is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee, Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it.
It will not be accepted, on my life.
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms.
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so; ’tis a point of friendship.
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
Say thy prayers, and farewell.
I would ’twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.
Why, thou owest God a death.
'Tis not due yet.
I would be loath to pay Him before His day.
What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me?
Well, ’tis no matter.
Honour pricks me on.
Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on?
How then?
Can honor set to a leg?
no.
Or an arm?
no.
Or take away the grief of a wound?
No.
Honor hath no skill in surgery, then?
No.
What is honor?
A word.
What is in that word “honor”?
What is that “honor”?
Air.
A trim reckoning.
Who hath it?
He that died o' Wednesday.
Doth he feel it?
No.
Doth he hear it?
No.
'Twere best he did.
Then are we all undone.
It is not possible, it cannot be The King should keep his word in loving us.
He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offense in other faults.
Deliver what you will; I’ll say ’tis so.
My uncle is returned.
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
Uncle, what news?
The King will bid you battle presently.
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
There is no seeming mercy in the King.
Did you beg any?
God forbid!
Arm, gentlemen; to arms.
For I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth, And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it, Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King, And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
No, by my soul.
Cousin, I think thou art enamorèd On his follies.
Never did I hear Of any Prince so wild a liberty.
But be he as he will, yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm, That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
My lord, here are letters for you.
I cannot read them now.
My lord, prepare.
The King comes on apace.
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale, For I profess not talking.
Only this: Let each man do his best.
What is thy name that in the battle thus Thou crossest me?
What honor dost thou seek Upon my head?
They tell thee true.
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry, This sword hath ended him.
So shall it thee, Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
Where?
Here.
This, Douglas?
No, I know this face full well.
A fool go with thy soul whither it goes!
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear.
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
The King hath many marching in his coats.
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats.
I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, Until I meet the King.
Up and away!
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
Though I could ’scape shot free at London, I fear the shot here.
Here’s no scoring but upon the pate.
Soft, who are you?
Sir Walter Blunt.
There’s honor for you.
What, stand’st thou idle here?
Lend me thy sword.
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day.
I have paid Percy; I have made him sure.
He is indeed, and living to kill thee.
I prithee, lend me thy sword.
Give it to me.
What, is it in the case?
Ay, Hal, ’tis hot, ’tis hot.
There’s that will sack a city.
I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself.
Thou bleedest too much.
Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
I beseech your Majesty, make up, Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
I will do so.
My Lord of Westmoreland, Lead him to his tent.
Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent.
Lead me, my lord?
We breathe too long.
Come, cousin Westmoreland, Our duty this way lies.
For God’s sake, come.
By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point With lustier maintenance than I did look for Of such an ungrown warrior.
O, this boy lends mettle to us all.
Another king!
they grow like Hydra’s heads.
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those That wear those colors on them.
What art thou That counterfeit’st the person of a king?
Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like Never to hold it up again.
The spirits Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms.
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee, Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
Stay, and breathe awhile.
Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion And showed thou mak’st some tender of my life In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
Make up to Clifton.
I’ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.
My name is Harry Percy.
Why, then I see A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy, To share with me in glory any more.
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere, Nor can one England brook a double reign, Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
I can no longer brook thy vanities.
Well said, Hal!
To it Hal!
Nay, you shall find no boys' play here, I can tell you.
O Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth.
For worms, brave Percy.
Fare thee well, great heart.
Ill weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
Emboweled?
If thou embowel me today, I’ll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow.
'Sblood, ’twas time to counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
Counterfeit?
I lie.
Come, brother John.
Full bravely hast thou fleshed Thy maiden sword.
But soft, whom have we here?
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
No, that’s certain.
I am not a double man.
But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a jack.
There is Percy.
If your father will do me any honor, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy himself.
I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.
Why, Percy I killed myself, and saw thee dead.
Didst thou?
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back.
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
I’ll follow, as they say, for reward.
He that rewards me, God reward him.
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
Ill spirited Worcester, did not we send grace, Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too.
Other offenders we will pause upon.
With all my heart.
Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you This honorable bounty shall belong.
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.
His valor shown upon our crests today Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds, Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
I thank your Grace for this high courtesy, Which I shall give away immediately.
Then this remains, that we divide our power.
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland, Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop, Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway, Meeting the check of such another day.
And since this business so fair is done, Let us not leave till all our own be won.
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
What shall I say you are?
Tell thou the Earl That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
His lordship is walked forth into the orchard.
Please it your Honor knock but at the gate And he himself will answer.
Here comes the Earl.
What news, Lord Bardolph?
Every minute now Should be the father of some stratagem.
The times are wild.
Contention, like a horse Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose And bears down all before him.
Noble Earl, I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
Good, an God will!
As good as heart can wish.
How is this derived?
Saw you the field?
Came you from Shrewsbury?
Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turned me back With joyful tidings and, being better horsed, Outrode me.
Ha?
My lord, I’ll tell you what: If my young lord your son have not the day, Upon mine honor, for a silken point I’ll give my barony.
Never talk of it.
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss?
Who, he?
Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title leaf, Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
So looks the strond whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness’d usurpation.
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
How doth my son and brother?
Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
Douglas is living, and your brother yet, But for my lord your son
Why, he is dead.
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath, by instinct, knowledge from others' eyes That what he feared is chancèd .
You are too great to be by me gainsaid, Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.
I see a strange confession in thine eye.
Thou shak’st thy head and hold’st it fear or sin To speak a truth.
If he be slain, say so.
I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
This strainèd passion doth you wrong, my lord.
Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor.
'Tis more than time.
And, my most noble lord, I hear for certain, and do speak the truth: The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well appointed powers.
He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers.
Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but, for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me.
The brain of this foolish compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is invented on me.
I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.
I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one.
If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
Let him be damned like the glutton!
Pray God his tongue be hotter!
He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your Worship a horse.
I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in Smithfield.
Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
What’s he that goes there?
Falstaff, an ’t please your Lordship.
He that was in question for the robbery?
What, to York?
Call him back again.
Sir John Falstaff!
Boy, tell him I am deaf.
You must speak louder.
My master is deaf.
I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
Go pluck him by the elbow.
I must speak with him.
Sir John!
What, a young knave and begging?
Is there not wars?
Is there not employment?
Doth not the King lack subjects?
Do not the rebels need soldiers?
You mistake me, sir.
Why sir, did I say you were an honest man?
Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.
I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.
I give thee leave to tell me so?
I lay aside that which grows to me?
Sir, my lord would speak with you.
Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
My good lord.
God give your Lordship good time of the day.
I am glad to see your Lordship abroad.
I heard say your Lordship was sick: I hope your Lordship goes abroad by advice.
Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.
I talk not of his Majesty.
You would not come when I sent for you.
And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy.
Well, God mend him.
I pray you let me speak with you.
What tell you me of it?
Be it as it is.
It hath its original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain.
I have read the cause of his effects in Galen.
It is a kind of deafness.
Very well, my lord, very well.
Rather, an ’t please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.
I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.
I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land service, I did not come.
Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
I would it were otherwise.
I would my means were greater and my waist slender.
You have misled the youthful Prince.
The young Prince hath misled me.
I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.
Well, I am loath to gall a new healed wound.
Your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s exploit on Gad’s Hill.
You may thank th' unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting that action.
My lord!
But since all is well, keep it so.
Wake not a sleeping wolf.
To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow.
There is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity.
His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
You follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angel.
Not so, my lord.
Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing.
And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go.
I cannot tell.
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age?
My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly.
For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems.
To approve my youth further, I will not.
The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding.
And he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him!
For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord.
I have checked him for it, and the young lion repents.
Well, God send the Prince a better companion.
God send the companion a better prince.
I cannot rid my hands of him.
Well, the King hath severed you and Prince Harry.
I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.
Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it.
Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your expedition!
Will your Lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?
Not a penny, not a penny.
You are too impatient to bear crosses.
Fare you well.
Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland.
If I do, fillip me with a three man beetle.
Sir.
What money is in my purse?
Seven groats and two pence.
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse.
Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is incurable.
I well allow the occasion of our arms, But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King.
Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice, And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus: Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland.
With him we may.
Yea, marry, there’s the point.
But if without him we be thought too feeble, My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand.
For in a theme so bloody faced as this, Conjecture, expectation, and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth, Should be stillborn and that we now possessed The utmost man of expectation, I think we are a body strong enough, Even as we are, to equal with the King.
That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded.
If he should do so, He leaves his back unarmed, the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels.
Never fear that.
Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
Let us on, And publish the occasion of our arms.
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice.
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?
We are time’s subjects, and time bids begone.
Master Fang, have you entered the action?
It is entered.
Where’s your yeoman?
Is ’t a lusty yeoman?
Will a' stand to ’t?
Sirrah!
Where’s Snare?
O Lord, ay, good Master Snare.
Here, here.
Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
Yea, good Master Snare, I have entered him and all.
It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
Alas the day, take heed of him.
He stabbed me in mine own house, and that most beastly, in good faith.
He cares not what mischief he does.
If his weapon be out, he will foin like any devil.
He will spare neither man, woman, nor child.
If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
An I but fist him once, an he come but within my vue
How now!
Whose mare’s dead?
What’s the matter?
Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.
Away, varlets!
Draw, Bardolph.
Cut me off the villain’s head.
Throw the quean in the channel.
Throw me in the channel?
I’ll throw thee in the channel.
Wilt thou, wilt thou, thou bastardly rogue?
Murder, murder!
Ah, thou honeysuckle villain, wilt thou kill God’s officers and the King’s?
Ah, thou honeyseed rogue, thou art a honeyseed, a man queller, and a woman queller.
Keep them off, Bardolph.
A rescue, a rescue!
Good people, bring a rescue or two.
Thou wot, wot thou?
Thou wot, wot ta?
Do, do, thou rogue.
Do, thou hempseed.
Away, you scullion, you rampallion, you fustilarian!
I’ll tickle your catastrophe.
What is the matter?
Keep the peace here, ho!
Good my lord, be good to me.
I beseech you stand to me.
How now, Sir John?
What, are you brawling here?
O my most worshipful lord, an ’t please your Grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.
For what sum?
It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all I have.
He hath eaten me out of house and home.
He hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his.
I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up.
How comes this, Sir John?
What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way.
It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration.
You have, as it appears to me, practiced upon the easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.
Yea, in truth, my lord.
Pray thee, peace.
Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villany you have done her.
My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply.
You call honorable boldness “impudent sauciness.
” If a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous.
No, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor.
Come hither, hostess.
Now, Master Gower, what news?
The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand.
The rest the paper tells.
As I am a gentleman!
Faith, you said so before.
As I am a gentleman.
Come.
By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining chambers.
Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking.
Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles.
I' faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la.
Let it alone.
I’ll make other shift.
You’ll be a fool still.
Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown.
I hope you’ll come to supper.
You’ll pay me all together?
Will I live?
Go with her, with her.
Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
No more words.
Let’s have her.
I have heard better news.
What’s the news, my good lord?
Where lay the King last night?
At Basingstoke, my lord.
I hope, my lord, all’s well.
What is the news, my lord?
Come all his forces back?
Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?
You shall have letters of me presently.
Come.
My lord!
What’s the matter?
Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?
Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?
Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool that taught them me.
This is the right fencing grace, my lord: tap for tap, and so part fair.
Now the Lord lighten thee.
Thou art a great fool.
Before God, I am exceeding weary.
Is ’t come to that?
I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood.
Faith, it does me; though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it.
Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.
Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature small beer.
But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness.
How ill it follows, after you have labored so hard, you should talk so idly!
Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?
Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.
It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
Go to.
I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.
By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency.
Let the end
The reason?
What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
It would be every man’s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks.
Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine.
Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed.
And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?
Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff.
And to thee.
By this light, I am well spoke on.
I can hear it with my own ears.
And the boy that I gave Falstaff.
He had him from me Christian, and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape.
God save your Grace.
And yours, most noble Bardolph.
Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing?
Wherefore blush you now?
What a maidenly man at arms are you become!
Is ’t such a matter to get a pottle pot’s maidenhead?
He calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window.
Has not the boy profited?
Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
Away, you rascally Althea’s dream, away!
Instruct us, boy.
What dream, boy?
Marry, my lord, Althea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand, and therefore I call him her dream.
A crown’s worth of good interpretation.
There ’tis, boy.
An you do not make him hanged among you, the gallows shall have wrong.
And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
Well, my good lord.
He heard of your Grace’s coming to town.
There’s a letter for you.
Delivered with good respect.
And how doth the Martlemas your master?
In bodily health, sir.
Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but that moves not him.
Though that be sick, it dies not.
I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog, and he holds his place, for look you how be writes.
John Falstaff, knight.
Why, this is a certificate.
Peace!
I will imitate the honorable Romans in brevity.
He sure means brevity in breath, short winded.
I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leave thee.
Be not too familiar with Poins, for he misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell.
Repent at idle times as thou mayest, and so, farewell.
Thine by yea and no, which is as much as to say, as thou usest him, Jack Falstaff with my familiars, John with my brothers and sisters, and Sir John with all Europe.
My lord, I’ll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
That’s to make him eat twenty of his words.
But do you use me thus, Ned?
Must I marry your sister?
God send the wench no worse fortune!
But I never said so.
Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
Is your master here in London?
Yea, my lord.
Where sups he?
Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
What company?
Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
Sup any women with him?
None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet.
What pagan may that be?
A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master’s.
Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull.
Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
I am your shadow, my lord.
I’ll follow you.
Sirrah you, boy and Bardolph, no word to your master that I am yet come to town.
There’s for your silence.
I have no tongue, sir.
And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
Fare you well.
Go.
I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint Alban’s and London.
How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colors, and not ourselves be seen?
Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at his table as drawers.
From a god to a bull: a heavy decension.
It was Jove’s case.
I have given over.
I will speak no more.
Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn, And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars.
Oh, fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armèd commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.
Come, come, go in with me.
'Tis with my mind As with the tide swelled up unto his height, That makes a still stand, running neither way.
Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop, But many thousand reasons hold me back.
I will resolve for Scotland.
What the devil hast thou brought there applejohns?
Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn.
Mass, thou sayest true.
Why then, cover, and set them down, and see if thou canst find out Sneak’s noise.
Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music.
By the Mass, here will be old utis.
It will be an excellent stratagem.
I’ll see if I can find out Sneak.
I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality.
Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire, and your color, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good truth, la .
Better than I was.
Why, that’s well said.
A good heart’s worth gold.
Lo, here comes Sir John.
Sick of a calm, yea, good faith.
So is all her sect.
An they be once in a calm, they are sick.
A pox damn you, muddy rascal.
Is that all the comfort you give me?
You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
I make them?
Gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not.
If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make the diseases, Doll.
We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you.
Grant that, my poor virtue, grant that.
Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
By my troth, this is the old fashion.
You two never meet but you fall to some discord.
You are both, i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts.
You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities.
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead?
There’s a whole merchant’s venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him.
You have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold.
Come, I’ll be friends with thee, Jack.
Thou art going to the wars, and whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.
Sir, Ancient Pistol’s below and would speak with you.
Hang him, swaggering rascal!
If he swagger, let him not come here.
No, by my faith, I must live among my neighbors.
Dost thou hear, hostess?
Pray you pacify yourself, Sir John.
There comes no swaggerers here.
Dost thou hear?
It is mine ancient.
Tilly vally, Sir John, ne'er tell me.
And your ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors.
He’s no swaggerer, hostess, a tame cheater, i' faith.
You may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound.
He’ll not swagger with a Barbary hen if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
“Cheater,” call you him?
I will bar no honest man my house, nor no cheater, but I do not love swaggering.
So you do, hostess.
Do I?
God save you, Sir John.
Welcome, Ancient Pistol.
Here, Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack.
Do you discharge upon mine hostess.
I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.
She is pistol proof.
Sir, you shall not hardly offend her.
Come, I’ll drink no proofs nor no bullets.
I’ll drink no more than will do me good, for no man’s pleasure, I.
Then to you, Mistress Dorothy!
I will charge you.
Charge me!
I scorn you, scurvy companion.
I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
Away, you cutpurse rascal, you filthy bung, away!
By this wine, I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me.
Away, you bottle ale rascal, you basket hilt stale juggler, you.
Since when, I pray you, sir?
God’s light, with two points on your shoulder?
God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.
No more, Pistol.
I would not have you go off here.
Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.
No, good Captain Pistol, not here, sweet captain.
Captain?
Thou abominable damned cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called captain?
An captains were of my mind, they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them.
You a captain?
You slave, for what?
For tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy house?
He a captain!
Hang him, rogue.
He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes.
A captain?
God’s light, these villains will make the word as odious as the word “occupy,” which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted.
Therefore captains had need look to ’t.
Pray thee go down, good ancient.
Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.
Pray thee go down.
Good Captain Peesell, be quiet.
'Tis very late, i' faith.
I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.
These be good humors indeed.
By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.
Begone, good ancient.
This will grow to a brawl anon.
Die men like dogs!
Give crowns like pins!
Have we not Hiren here?
Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis.
Come, give ’s some sack.
Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.
Fear we broadsides?
No, let the fiend give fire.
Give me some sack, and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
Come we to full points here?
And are etceteras nothing?
Pistol, I would be quiet.
Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf.
What, we have seen the seven stars.
For God’s sake, thrust him downstairs.
I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.
“Thrust him downstairs?"
Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove groat shilling.
Come, get you downstairs.
What!
shall we have incision?
Shall we imbrue?
Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days.
Here’s goodly stuff toward!
Give me my rapier, boy.
I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee do not draw.
Get you downstairs.
Here’s a goodly tumult.
I’ll forswear keeping house afore I’ll be in these tirrits and frights.
So, murder, I warrant now.
I pray thee, Jack, be quiet.
The rascal’s gone.
Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you.
Are you not hurt i' the groin?
Methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly.
Have you turned him out o' doors?
Yea, sir.
The rascal’s drunk.
You have hurt him, sir, i' the shoulder.
A rascal to brave me!
Ah, you sweet little rogue, you.
Alas, poor ape, how thou sweat’st!
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Come on, you whoreson chops.
Ah, rogue, i' faith, I love thee.
Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies.
Ah, villain!
Ah, rascally slave!
I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
Do, an thou darest for thy heart.
An thou dost, I’ll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.
The music is come, sir.
Let them play.
Play, sirs.
Sit on my knee, Doll.
A rascal bragging slave!
The rogue fled from me like quicksilver.
I' faith, and thou followed’st him like a church.
Peace, good Doll.
Do not speak like a death’s head; do not bid me remember mine end.
Sirrah, what humor’s the Prince of?
They say Poins has a good wit.
He a good wit?
Hang him, baboon.
His wit’s as thick as Tewksbury mustard.
There’s no more conceit in him than is in a mallet.
Why does the Prince love him so then?
Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
Let’s beat him before his whore.
Look whe'er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot.
Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?
Kiss me, Doll.
Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction!
What says th' almanac to that?
And look whether the fiery trigon, his man, be not lisping to his master’s old tables, his notebook, his counsel keeper.
Thou dost give me flattering busses.
By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.
I am old, I am old.
I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young boy of them all.
What stuff wilt have a kirtle of?
I shall receive money o' Thursday; shalt have a cap tomorrow.
A merry song!
Come, it grows late.
We’ll to bed.
Thou 'lt forget me when I am gone.
By my troth, thou 'lt set me a weeping an thou sayest so.
Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return.
Well, harken a' th' end.
Some sack, Francis.
Anon, anon, sir.
Ha?
A bastard son of the King’s?
And art not thou Poins his brother?
Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost thou lead?
A better than thou.
Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears.
O, the Lord preserve thy good Grace!
By my troth, welcome to London.
Now the Lord bless that sweet face of thine.
O Jesu, are you come from Wales?
Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty,  by this light flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
How?
You fat fool, I scorn you.
My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
Didst thou hear me?
Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away by Gad’s Hill.
You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to try my patience.
No, no, no; not so.
I did not think thou wast within hearing.
I shall drive you, then, to confess the wilfull abuse, and then I know how to handle you.
No abuse, Hal, o' mine honor, no abuse.
No abuse, Hal.
No abuse?
No abuse, Ned, i' th' world, honest Ned, none.
See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us.
Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable, and his face is Lucifer’s privy kitchen, where he doth nothing but roast malt worms.
For the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the devil outbids him too.
For the women?
For one of them, she’s in hell already and burns poor souls.
For the other, I owe her money, and whether she be damned for that I know not.
No, I warrant you.
No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for that.
All vitlars do so.
What’s a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent?
You, gentlewoman.
What says your Grace?
His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.
Who knocks so loud at door?
Look to th' door there, Francis.
Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked.
You must away to court, sir, presently.
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
Pay the musicians, sirrah.
Farewell, hostess .
Farewell, Doll.
You see, my good wenches, how men of merit are sought after.
The undeserver may sleep when the man of action is called on.
Farewell, good wenches.
If I be not sent away post, I will see you again ere I go.
I cannot speak.
Farewell, farewell.
Well, fare thee well.
I have known thee these twenty nine years, come peascod time, but an honester and truer hearted man well, fare thee well.
Mistress Tearsheet!
What’s the matter?
Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.
O, run, Doll, run, run, good Doll.
Come.
Many good morrows to your Majesty.
Is it good morrow, lords?
'Tis one o'clock, and past.
Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
Have you read o'er the letter that I sent you?
We have, my liege.
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is, what rank diseases grow And with what danger near the heart of it.
It is but as a body yet distempered, Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine.
My Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled.
Are these things then necessities?
It cannot be, my lord.
Rumor doth double, like the voice and echo, The numbers of the feared.
Please it your Grace To go to bed.
Upon my soul, my lord, The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily.
To comfort you the more, I have received A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill, And these unseasoned hours perforce must add Unto your sickness.
I will take your counsel.
And were these inward wars once out of hand, We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me your hand, sir, give me your hand, sir.
An early stirrer, by the rood.
And how doth my good cousin Silence?
Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
And how doth my cousin your bedfellow?
And your fairest daughter and mine, my goddaughter Ellen?
Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow.
By yea and no, sir.
I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar.
He is at Oxford still, is he not?
Indeed, sir, to my cost.
He must then to the Inns o' Court shortly.
I was once of Clement’s Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.
You were called “Lusty Shallow” then, cousin.
By the Mass, I was called anything, and I would have done anything indeed too, and roundly too.
There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man.
You had not four such swinge bucklers in all the Inns o' Court again.
And I may say to you, we knew where the bona robas were and had the best of them all at commandment.
This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
The same Sir John, the very same.
We shall all follow, cousin.
Certain, ’tis certain; very sure, very sure.
Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all.
All shall die.
How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford Fair?
By my troth, cousin, I was not there.
Death is certain.
Is old Dooble of your town living yet?
Dead, sir.
Jesu, Jesu, dead!
He drew a good bow, and dead?
He shot a fine shoot.
John o' Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on his head.
Dead!
Thereafter as they be, a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds.
And is old Dooble dead?
Here come two of Sir John Falstaff’s men, as I think.
Good morrow, honest gentlemen.
I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?
I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county and one of the King’s justices of the peace.
What is your good pleasure with me?
He greets me well, sir.
I knew him a good backsword man.
How doth the good knight?
May I ask how my lady his wife doth?
Sir, pardon.
A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
It is very just.
Look, here comes good Sir John.
Give me your good hand, give me your Worship’s good hand.
I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.
Master Sure card, as I think?
No, Sir John.
It is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.
Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the peace.
Your good Worship is welcome.
Fie, this is hot weather, gentlemen.
Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
Marry, have we, sir.
Will you sit?
Let me see them, I beseech you.
Where’s the roll?
Where’s the roll?
Where’s the roll?
Let me see, let me see, let me see.
So, so, so, so, so.
So, so.
Yea, marry, sir.
Rafe Mouldy!
Here, an it please you.
What think you, Sir John?
A good limbed fellow; young, strong, and of good friends.
Is thy name Mouldy?
Yea, an ’t please you.
'Tis the more time thou wert used.
Ha, ha, ha, most excellent, i' faith!
Things that are mouldy lack use.
Very singular good, in faith.
Well said, Sir John, very well said.
Prick him.
I was pricked well enough before, an you could have let me alone.
My old dame will be undone now for one to do her
Go to.
Peace, Mouldy.
Spent?
Peace, fellow, peace.
Stand aside.
Know you where you are?
For th' other, Sir John.
Let me see.
Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under.
He’s like to be a cold soldier.
Where’s Shadow?
Here, sir.
Shadow, whose son art thou?
My mother’s son, sir.
Thy mother’s son!
Like enough, and thy father’s shadow.
So the son of the female is the shadow of the male.
It is often so, indeed, but much of the father’s substance.
Do you like him, Sir John?
Shadow will serve for summer.
Prick him, for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster book.
Thomas Wart!
Where’s he?
Here, sir.
Is thy name Wart?
Yea, sir.
Thou art a very ragged wart.
Shall I prick him down, Sir John?
Ha, ha, ha.
You can do it, sir, you can do it.
I commend you well.
Francis Feeble!
Here, sir.
What trade art thou, Feeble?
A woman’s tailor, sir.
Shall I prick him, sir?
I will do my good will, sir.
You can have no more.
Well said, good woman’s tailor, well said, courageous Feeble.
I would Wart might have gone, sir.
I would thou wert a man’s tailor, that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go.
I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands.
Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
It shall suffice, sir.
I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble.
Who is next?
Peter Bullcalf o' th' green.
Yea, marry, let’s see Bullcalf.
Here, sir.
Fore God, a likely fellow.
Come, prick me Bullcalf till he roar again.
O Lord, good my lord captain
O Lord, sir, I am a diseased man.
What disease hast thou?
Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown.
We will have away thy cold, and I will take such order that my friends shall ring for thee .
Is here all?
Here is two more called than your number.
Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner.
I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George’s Field?
No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.
Ha, ’twas a merry night.
And is Jane Nightwork alive?
She lives, Master Shallow.
She never could away with me.
By the Mass, I could anger her to th' heart.
She was then a bona roba.
Doth she hold her own well?
Old, old, Master Shallow.
Nay, she must be old.
She cannot choose but be old.
Certain, she’s old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement’s Inn.
That’s fifty five year ago.
We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
That we have, that we have, that we have.
In faith, Sir John, we have.
Our watchword was “Hem, boys.
” Come, let’s to dinner; come, let’s to dinner.
Jesus, the days that we have seen!
Come, come.
Go to.
Stand aside.
And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame’s sake, stand my friend.
She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone, and she is old and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
Go to.
Stand aside.
By my troth, I care not.
Well said.
Th' art a good fellow.
Faith, I’ll bear no base mind.
Come, sir, which men shall I have?
Four of which you please.
Sir, a word with you.
I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.
Go to, well.
Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
Do you choose for me.
Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.
Mouldy and Bullcalf!
For you, Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service.
Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong.
They are your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
Hold, Wart.
Traverse.
Thas, thas, thas.
He is not his craft’s master.
He doth not do it right.
These fellows will do well, Master Shallow.
God keep you, Master Silence.
I will not use many words with you.
Fare you well, gentlemen both.
I thank you.
I must a dozen mile to night.
Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.
Fore God, would you would, Master Shallow.
Go to.
I have spoke at a word.
God keep you.
Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.
What is this forest called?
'Tis Gaultree Forest, an ’t shall please your Grace.
We have sent forth already.
'Tis well done.
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to pieces.
Now, what news?
The just proportion that we gave them out.
Let us sway on and face them in the field.
What well appointed leader fronts us here?
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
Health and fair greeting from our general, The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace, What doth concern your coming.
Then, my lord, Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech.
Wherefore do I this?
So the question stands.
When ever yet was your appeal denied?
Wherein have you been gallèd by the King?
What peer hath been suborned to grate on you, That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion’s bitter edge?
What thing, in honor, had my father lost, That need to be revived and breathed in me?
You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
But he hath forced us to compel this offer; And it proceeds from policy, not love.
Mowbray, you overween to take it so.
This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.
Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley.
That argues but the shame of your offense.
A rotten case abides no handling.
Hath the Prince John a full commission, In very ample virtue of his father, To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
That is intended in the General’s name.
I muse you make so slight a question.
Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule, For this contains our general grievances.
This will I show the General.
My lord, we will do so.
There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand.
Fear you not that.
If we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon, Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
No, no, my lord.
Be it so.
Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland.
The Prince is here at hand.
Your Grace of York, in God’s name then set forward.
Before, and greet his Grace.
My lord, we come.
You are well encountered here, my cousin Mowbray.
If not, we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man.
You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow To sound the bottom of the after times.
Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles.
I take your princely word for these redresses.
I give it you, and will maintain my word, And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
Go, captain, and deliver to the army This news of peace.
Let them have pay, and part.
I know it will well please them.
Hie thee, captain.
To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
I do not doubt you.
I am glad of it.
Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
You wish me health in very happy season, For I am on the sudden something ill.
Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
So much the worse if your own rule be true.
The word of peace is rendered.
Hark how they shout.
This had been cheerful after victory.
A peace is of the nature of a conquest, For then both parties nobly are subdued, And neither party loser.
Go, my lord, And let our army be dischargèd too.
I trust, lords, we shall lie tonight together.
The leaders, having charge from you to stand, Will not go off until they hear you speak.
They know their duties.
My lord, our army is dispersed already.
Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses East, west, north, south, or, like a school broke up, Each hurries toward his home and sporting place.
Is this proceeding just and honorable?
Is your assembly so?
Will you thus break your faith?
I pawned thee none.
I promised you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain, which, by mine honor, I will perform with a most Christian care.
But for you rebels, look to taste the due
What’s your name, sir?
Of what condition are you, and of what place, I pray?
I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the Dale.
Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your degree, and your place the Dale.
Colevile shall be still your name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deep enough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale.
Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am.
I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield me.
The heat is past.
Follow no further now.
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus.
I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor.
Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
I know not.
Here he is, and here I yield him.
Let it shine, then.
Thine’s too thick to shine.
Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, and call it what you will.
Is thy name Colevile?
It is, my lord.
A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
And a famous true subject took him.
Now, have you left pursuit?
Retreat is made and execution stayed.
Send Colevile with his confederates To York, to present execution.
Blunt, lead him hence, and see you guard him sure.
Fare you well, Falstaff.
I, in my condition, Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
The army is discharged all and gone.
Let them go.
I’ll through Gloucestershire, and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire.
Now, lords, if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors, We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
Both which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoy.
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, Where is the Prince your brother?
I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
And how accompanied?
I do not know, my lord.
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?
No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
What would my lord and father?
Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.
Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers.
I shall observe him with all care and love.
Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
He is not there today; he dines in London.
And how accompanied?
Canst thou tell that?
With Poins and other his continual followers.
My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite.
'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion.
Health to my sovereign, and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver.
Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace’s hand.
Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all Are brought to the correction of your law.
O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird, Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day.
And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
Will fortune never come with both hands full, But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
She either gives a stomach and no food
Comfort, your Majesty.
O, my royal father!
My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
Be patient, princes.
You do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary.
Stand from him, give him air.
He’ll straight be well.
No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs.
Th' incessant care and labor of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out.
Speak lower, princes, for the King recovers.
This apoplexy will certain be his end.
I pray you, take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber.
Softly, pray.
Call for the music in the other room.
Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
Less noise, less noise.
Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
I am here, brother, full of heaviness.
How now!
Rain within doors, and none abroad?
How doth the King?
Exceeding ill.
Heard he the good news yet?
Tell it him.
He altered much upon the hearing it.
If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without physic.
Not so much noise, my lords.
Sweet Prince, speak low.
The King your father is disposed to sleep.
Let us withdraw into the other room.
Will ’t please your Grace to go along with us?
No, I will sit and watch here by the King.
Warwick!
Gloucester!
Clarence!
Doth the King call?
What would your Majesty?
How fares your Grace?
Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
We left the Prince my brother here, my liege, Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
The Prince of Wales?
Where is he?
Let me see him.
He is not here.
This door is open.
He is gone this way.
He came not through the chamber where we stayed.
Where is the crown?
Who took it from my pillow?
When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
The Prince hath ta'en it hence.
Go seek him out.
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death?
Find him, my Lord of Warwick.
Chide him hither.
But wherefore did he take away the crown?
I never thought to hear you speak again.
Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.
I stay too long by thee; I weary thee.
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors Before thy hour be ripe?
O foolish youth, Thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.
O pardon me, my liege!
But for my tears, The moist impediments unto my speech, I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far.
My gracious liege, You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me.
Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.
Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father.
My Lord of Warwick.
Doth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
'Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.
Laud be to God!
Even there my life must end.
It hath been prophesied to me many years, I should not die but in Jerusalem, Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.
But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie.
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.
By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away tonight.
What, Davy, I say!
You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
I will not excuse you.
You shall not be excused.
Excuses shall not be admitted.
There is no excuse shall serve.
You shall not be excused.
Why, Davy!
Here, sir.
Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served.
And again, sir, shall we sow the hade land with wheat?
With red wheat, Davy.
But for William cook, are there no young pigeons?
Yes, sir.
Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing and plow irons.
Let it be cast and paid.
Sir John, you shall not be excused.
Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had.
And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William’s wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley Fair?
He shall answer it.
Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
No worse than they are back bitten, sir, for they have marvellous foul linen.
Well conceited, Davy.
About thy business, Davy.
There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor.
That Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.
Go to, I say he shall have no wrong.
Look about, Davy.
I am glad to see your Worship.
I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph,  and welcome, my tall fellow.
Come, Sir John.
I’ll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.
Sir John.
I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.
How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?
How doth the King?
Exceeding well.
His cares are now all ended.
I hope, not dead.
I would his Majesty had called me with him.
The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuries.
Indeed, I think the young King loves you not.
Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.
O, that the living Harry had the temper Of he the worst of these three gentlemen!
O God, I fear all will be overturned.
Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.
Good morrow, cousin.
We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.
Peace be with us, lest we be heavier.
Though no man be assured what grace to find, You stand in coldest expectation.
I am the sorrier; would ’twere otherwise.
Here comes the Prince.
Good morrow, and God save your Majesty.
This new and gorgeous garment majesty Sits not so easy on me as you think.
Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.
We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.
You all look strangely on me.
And you most.
You are, I think, assured I love you not.
I am assured, if I be measured rightly, Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
No?
How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me?
What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison Th' immediate heir of England?
Was this easy?
I then did use the person of your father; The image of his power lay then in me.
You are right, justice, and you weigh this well.
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword.
Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.
Barren, barren, barren, beggars all, beggars all, Sir John.
Marry, good air.
Spread, Davy, spread, Davy.
Well said, Davy.
This Davy serves you for good uses.
He is your servingman and your husband.
A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet, Sir John.
By the Mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper.
A good varlet.
Now sit down, now sit down.
Come, cousin.
There’s a merry heart!
Good Master Silence, I’ll give you a health for that anon.
Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.
Sweet sir, sit.
I’ll be with you anon.
Most sweet sir, sit.
Master page, good master page, sit.
Proface.
What you want in meat, we’ll have in drink, but you must bear.
Be merry, Master Bardolph.
And, my little soldier there, be merry.
I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle.
Who, I?
I have been merry twice and once ere now.
There’s a dish of leather coats for you.
Davy!
Your Worship, I’ll be with you straight.
A cup of wine, sir?
Well said, Master Silence.
Health and long life to you, Master Silence.
Honest Bardolph, welcome.
If thou wantest anything and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart.
Welcome, my little tiny thief, and welcome indeed too.
I’ll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cabileros about London.
I hope to see London once ere I die.
And I might see you there, Davy!
By the Mass, you’ll crack a quart together, ha, will you not, Master Bardolph?
Yea, sir, in a pottle pot.
By God’s liggens, I thank thee.
The knave will stick by thee, I can assure thee that.
He will not out, he.
And I’ll stick by him, sir.
Why, there spoke a king.
Lack nothing, be merry.
Why, now you have done me right.
'Tis so.
Is ’t so?
Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
An ’t please your Worship, there’s one Pistol come from the court with news.
From the court?
Let him come in.
Sir John, God save you.
What wind blew you hither, Pistol?
Not the ill wind which blows no man to good.
Sweet knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.
By 'r Lady, I think he be, but Goodman Puff of Barson.
Puff?
Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.
A foutre for the world and worldlings base!
I speak of Africa and golden joys.
O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?
Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons, And shall good news be baffled?
Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
Why then, lament therefor.
Under which king, besonian?
Speak or die.
Under King Harry.
Harry the Fourth, or Fifth?
Harry the Fourth.
A foutre for thine office!
Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king.
Harry the Fifth’s the man.
I speak the truth.
What, is the old king dead?
As nail in door.
The things I speak are just.
O joyful day!
I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.
What, I do bring good news!
Carry Master Silence to bed.
Master Shallow, my Lord Shallow, be what thou wilt.
I am Fortune’s steward.
Get on thy boots.
We’ll ride all night.
O sweet Pistol!
Away, Bardolph!
Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!
“Where is the life that late I led?” say they.
No, thou arrant knave.
I would to God that I might die, that I might have thee hanged.
Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint.
The Constables have delivered her over to me, and she shall have whipping cheer enough, I warrant her.
There hath been a man or two lately killed about her.
Nut hook, nut hook, you lie!
O the Lord, that Sir John were come!
I would make this a bloody day to somebody.
But I pray God the fruit of her womb might miscarry.
If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; you have but eleven now.
Come, I charge you both go with me, for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.
I’ll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I will have you as soundly swinged for this, you bluebottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner.
If you be not swinged, I’ll forswear half kirtles.
Come, come, you she knight errant, come.
O God, that right should thus overcome might!
Well, of sufferance comes ease.
Come, you rogue, come, bring me to a justice.
Ay, come, you starved bloodhound.
Goodman Death, Goodman Bones!
Thou atomy, thou!
Come, you thin thing, come, you rascal.
Very well.
More rushes, more rushes.
The trumpets have sounded twice.
'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the coronation.
Dispatch, dispatch.
Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow.
I will make the King do you grace.
I will leer upon him as he comes by, and do but mark the countenance that he will give me.
God bless thy lungs, good knight!
Come here, Pistol, stand behind me.
O, if I had had time to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you.
But ’tis no matter.
It doth so.
It shows my earnestness of affection
It doth so.
My devotion
It doth, it doth, it doth.
As it were, to ride day and night, and not to deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to shift me
It is best, certain.
'Tis semper idem , for obsque hoc nihil est ; ’tis all in every part.
'Tis so indeed.
My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver, and make thee rage.
Thy Doll and Helen of thy noble thoughts is in base durance and contagious prison, Haled thither by most mechanical and dirty hand.
Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s snake, for Doll is in.
Pistol speaks nought but truth.
I will deliver her.
There roared the sea, and trumpet clangor sounds.
God save thy Grace, King Hal, my royal Hal.
The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!
God save thee, my sweet boy!
My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man.
Have you your wits?
Know you what ’tis to speak?
My King, my Jove, I speak to thee, my heart!
I know thee not, old man.
Fall to thy prayers.
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester.
Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.
That can hardly be, Master Shallow.
Do not you grieve at this.
I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw.
I beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand.
Sir, I will be as good as my word.
This that you heard was but a color.
A color that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
Fear no colors.
Go with me to dinner.
Come, Lieutenant Pistol.
Come, Bardolph.
I shall be sent for soon at night.
My lord, my lord
I cannot now speak.
I will hear you soon.
Take them away.
Si fortune me tormenta, spero me contenta.
I like this fair proceeding of the King’s.
And so they are.
The King hath called his parliament, my lord.
He hath.
Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention!
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
It must be thought on.
This would drink deep.
'Twould drink the cup and all.
But what prevention?
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father’s body But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seemed to die too.
Yea, at that very moment Consideration like an angel came And whipped th' offending Adam out of him, Leaving his body as a paradise T' envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made, Never came reformation in a flood With such a heady currance scouring faults, Nor never Hydra headed willfulness So soon did lose his seat, and all at once, As in this king.
We are blessèd in the change.
Hear him but reason in divinity And, all admiring, with an inward wish, You would desire the King were made a prelate.
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, You would say it hath been all in all his study.
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music.
It must be so, for miracles are ceased, And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected.
But, my good lord, How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the Commons?
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no?
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
With good acceptance of his Majesty  Save that there was not time enough to hear, As I perceived his Grace would fain have done, The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms, And generally to the crown and seat of France, Derived from Edward, his great grandfather.
What was th' impediment that broke this off?
The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience.
And the hour, I think, is come To give him hearing.
Is it four o'clock?
It is.
Then go we in to know his embassy, Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
Not here in presence.
Send for him, good uncle.
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
Not yet, my cousin.
We would be resolved, Before we hear him, of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France.
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it.
Sure we thank you.
My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers That owe yourselves, your lives, and services To this imperial throne.
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
You are their heir, you sit upon their throne, The blood and courage that renownèd them Runs in your veins; and my thrice puissant liege
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself As did the former lions of your blood.
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might; So hath your Highness.
We must not only arm t' invade the French, But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot, who will make road upon us With all advantages.
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.
But there’s a saying very old and true: “If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin.
” For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.
It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
May’t please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge, Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.
Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.
What treasure, uncle?
Tennis balls, my liege.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturbed With chases.
And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.
This was a merry message.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected, and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings.
For, God before, We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
Now thrive the armorers, and honor’s thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man.
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, Following the mirror of all Christian kings With wingèd heels, as English Mercurys.
For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point, With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation, Shake in their fear, and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England, model to thy inward greatness, Like little body with a mighty heart, What might’st thou do, that honor would thee do, Were all thy children kind and natural!
Well met, Corporal Nym.
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
For my part, I care not.
I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may.
I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron.
It is a simple one, but what though?
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that’s the certain of it.
And when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may.
That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it.
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth plight to her.
I cannot tell.
Things must be as they may.
Men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time, and some say knives have edges.
It must be as it may.
Though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod.
There must be conclusions.
Well, I cannot tell.
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.
Good corporal, be patient here.
How now, mine host Pistol?
Base tyke, call’st thou me host?
Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term, Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we
Good lieutenant, good corporal, offer nothing here.
Pish!
Pish for thee, Iceland dog, Thou prick eared cur of Iceland!
Will you go away?
Solo, you shocking dog?
I will cut your throat sometime or other, fairly.
That's the way it is.
Couple à gorge, that's the French for "cut your throat".
I challenge you again.
Oh you Cretan dog, do you think you'll get my spouse?
Can I reconcile you two?
Let the rivers flood and demons howl for food!
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won from you betting?
It's shameful to be a slave who pays his debts.
By this sword, I'll kill whoever hits first.
I'll have my gold coin?
In cash, fairly paid.
Well, then, that's the way it is.
If you were ever born from women, come in quickly to see Sir John.
The king made him sick, that's the truth of it.
The king is a good king, but it must go however it can go.
Let's grieve for the knight, for, my lambs, we will survive.
By God, the king is brave to trust these traitors.
They're acting so calmly, as if Patriotism sat in their hearts crowned with faithfulness and loyalty.
Now the wind is blowing in the right direction so we'll board our ships.
I think so too.
Uncle Exeter, free the man arrested yesterday for complaining about me.
That's mercy, but you're too confident.
Oh, let me be merciful.
Sir, you would show great mercy by allowing him to live after punishing him terribly.
I was, my lord.
And you told me the same, my king.
And me, my royal king.
Then, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there's yours.
According to your own advice, the mercy that was alive in me lately has been suppressed and killed.
May God be merciful on you.
Please, sweet husband, let me accompany you to Staines .
No, he's surely not in hell!
They say he complained about wine.
Yes, he did.
And about women.
No, he didn't do that.
Yes, he did, and said they were devils incarnate.
He could never stand carnation .
He did, in a way, indeed, touch on women, but then he got watery eyes and talked about the Whore of Babylon.
Shall we set off?
The King will be gone from Southampton soon.
Come, let's go.
And they say that's not very healthy food.
Kiss her soft mouth, and march.
I cannot kiss, that is the humor of it.
But adieu.
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close, I thee command.
Farewell.
Adieu.
Thus comes the English with full power upon us, And more than carefully it us concerns To answer royally in our defenses.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany, Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant.
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields.
To view the sick and feeble parts of France.
Oh peace, Prince Dauphin!
You are too much mistaken in this king.
Well, ’tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
But though we think it so, it is no matter.
In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems.
Think we King Harry strong, And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us, And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths.
Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty.
We’ll give them present audience.
Go, and bring them.
Turn head and stop pursuit, for coward dogs Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten Runs far before them.
Good my sovereign, Take up the English short, and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self love, my liege, is not so vile a sin As self neglecting.
From our brother England?
Or else what follows?
Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
For us, we will consider of this further.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England.
For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.
What to him from England?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Say, if my father render fair return, It is against my will, for I desire Nothing but odds with England.
To that end, As matching to his youth and vanity, I did present him with the Paris balls.
He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it, Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.
And be assured you’ll find a difference, As we his subjects have in wonder found, Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now.
Now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain.
That you shall read In your own losses, if he stay in France.
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay, For he is footed in this land already.
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions.
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence.
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought.
Suppose that you have seen The well appointed king at Hampton pier Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.
Play with your fancies and in them behold, Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give To sounds confused.
Behold the threaden sails, Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind, Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea, Breasting the lofty surge.
Oh, do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th' inconstant billows dancing, For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur.
Follow, follow!
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or close the wall up with our English dead!
On, on, on, on, on!
To the breach, to the breach!
Pray thee, corporal, stay.
The knocks are too hot, and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives.
The humor of it is too hot; that is the very plainsong of it.
“The plainsong” is most just, for humors do abound.
Would I were in an alehouse in London!
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mold.
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage, abate thy rage, great duke.
Good bawcock, 'bate thy rage.
Use lenity, sweet chuck.
These be good humors.
Your Honor wins bad humors.
As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers.
I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me.
To the mines?
Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war.
The concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.
By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions.
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
I think it be.
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
I will verify as much in his beard.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th'aunchient wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions.
By Cheshu, he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.
I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
Godden to your Worship, good Captain James.
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines?
Have the pioneers given o'er?
By Chrish, la, ’tish ill done.
The work ish give over.
The trompet sound the retreat.
By my hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill done.
It ish give over.
I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour.
Oh, ’tish ill done, ’tish ill done, by my hand, ’tish ill done.
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars?
In the way of argument, look you, and friendly communication, partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the point.
It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captens bath, and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick occasion, that sall I, marry.
It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me.
The day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the king, and the dukes.
It is no time to discourse.
The town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the breach, and we talk and, be Chrish, do nothing, ’tis shame for us all.
So God sa' me, ’tis shame to stand still.
It is shame, by my hand.
And there is throats to be cut and works to be done, and there ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me,
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation
Of my nation?
What ish my nation?
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal.
What ish my nation?
Who talks of my nation?
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as, in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities.
I do not know you so good a man as myself.
So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
Ah, that’s a foul fault.
The town sounds a parley.
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war, and there is an end.
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or, like to men proud of destruction, Defy us to our worst.
For, as I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, If I begin the batt'ry once again, I will not leave the half achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand, shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.
What is it then to me if impious war, Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends, Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats Enlinked to waste and desolation?
What is ’t to me, when you yourselves are cause, If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore.
Therefore, you men of Harfleur, Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command, Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.
If not, why, in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters, Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry At Herod’s bloody hunting slaughtermen.
What say you?
Our expectation hath this day an end.
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated, Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege.
Therefore, great King, We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, For we no longer are defensible.
Alice, tu as été en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
Un peu, madame .
Je te prie, m'enseignez.
Il faut que j'apprenne à parler .
Comment appelez vous la main en anglais?
La main?
Elle est appelée “de hand.
“De hand.
” Et les doigts?
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?
Je pense qu'ils sont appelés “de fingres”; oui, “de fingres.
La main , “de hand”; les doigts , “de fingres.
” Je pense que je suis le bon écolier.
J'ai gagné deux mots d'anglais vitement.
Comment appelez vous les ongles?
Les ongles?
Nous les appelons “de nails.
“De nails.
” Écoutez.
Dites moi si je parle bien : “de hand, de fingres, et de nails.
”
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.
Dites moi l'anglais pour le bras.
“De arme,” madame.
Et le coude?
“D'elbow.
“D'elbow.
” Je m'en fais la répétition de tous les mots que vous m'avez appris dés à présent.
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
Excusez moi, Alice.
Écoutez: “de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arma, de bilbow.
”
“D'elbow,” madame.
Ô Seigneur Dieu!
Je m'en oublie; “d'elbow.
” Comment appelez vous le col?
“De nick,” madame.
“De nick.
” Et le menton?
“De chin.
“De sin.
” Le col, “de nick”; le menton, “de sin.
Oui.
Sauf votre honneur, en vérité, vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grâce de Dieu, et en peu de temps.
N'avez vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai enseigné?
Non, je réciterai à vous promptement: “de hand, de fingre, de nails ”
“De nails,” madame.
“De nails, de arme, de ilbow.
”
Sauf votre honneur, “d'elbow.
Ainsi dis je: “d'elbow, de nick, et de sin.
” Comment appelez vous le pied et la robe?
“Le foot,” madame, et “le count.
”
“ Le foot” et “de count.
” Ô Seigneur Dieu!
Ils sont mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde.
Foh!
“Le foot” et “le count”!
Excellent, madame!
C'est assez pour une fois: Allons nous à dîner.
'Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme.
An if he be not fought withal, my lord, Let us not live in France.
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
Mort de ma vie, if they march along Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook shotten isle of Albion.
Dieu de batailles, where have they this mettle?
Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull, On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale, Killing their fruit with frowns?
Can sodden water, A drench for sur reined jades, their barley broth, Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, Seem frosty?
Oh, for honor of our land, Let us not hang like roping icicles Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
“Poor” we may call them in their native lords.
By faith and honor, Our madams mock at us and plainly say Our mettle is bred out and they will give Their bodies to the lust of English youth To new store France with bastard warriors.
And teach lavoltas high, and swift corantos, Saying our grace is only in our heels And that we are most lofty runaways.
They bid us to the English dancing schools.
Where is Montjoy the herald?
Speed him hence.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes, and, with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords, hie to the field: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; You dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, and of Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jacques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Faulconbridge, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
This becomes the great!
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, His soldiers sick and famished in their march , For, I am sure, when he shall see our army He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom.
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all, And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.
How now, Captain Fluellen?
Come you from the bridge?
I assure you, there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
The duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power.
He is not, God be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge.
I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.
What do you call him?
He is called Aunchient Pistol.
I know him not.
Here is the man.
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors.
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.
Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate And giddy Fortune’s furious fickle wheel, That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stone
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant, and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls and rolls.
In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it.
Fortune is an excellent moral.
Fortune is Bardolph’s foe and frowns on him, For he hath stolen a pax and hangèd must he be.
A damnèd death!
Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free, And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.
But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price.
Therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice  And let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach.
Speak, Captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Why then, rejoice therefore.
Die and be damned, and figo for thy friendship!
It is well.
The fig of Spain!
Very good.
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal.
I remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.
I’ll assure you, he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day.
But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.
Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier.
And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done  at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on.
I tell you what, Captain Gower.
I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is.
If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.
How now, Fluellen, cam’st thou from the bridge?
Ay, so please your Majesty.
The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.
The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages.
Marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge.
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a prave man.
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great.
Marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man.
His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o' fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire’s out.
We would have all such offenders so cut off, and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided
You know me by my habit.
Well then, I know thee.
What shall I know of thee?
My master’s mind.
Unfold it.
Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry of England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
Advantage is a better soldier than rashness.
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.
Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.
England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance.
What is thy name?
I know thy quality.
Montjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
I shall deliver so.
Thanks to your Highness.
I hope they will not come upon us now.
We are in God’s hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge.
It now draws toward night.
Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves, And on tomorrow bid them march away.
Tut, I have the best armor of the world.
Would it were day!
You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Will it never be morning?
My lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
What a long night is this!
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
He’s of the color of the nutmeg.
And of the heat of the ginger.
It is a beast for Perseus.
He is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him.
He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
It is the prince of palfreys.
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
No more, cousin.
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Your mistress bears well.
Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
So perhaps did yours.
Mine was not bridled.
Oh, then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode, like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your straight strossers.
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs.
I had rather have my horse to my mistress.
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress.
“Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie lavée au bourbier.
” Thou mak’st use of anything.
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
Stars, my lord.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
And yet my sky shall not want.
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and ’twere more honor some were away.
Ev'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.
Would I were able to load him with his desert!
Will it never be day?
I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of my way.
But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them.
'Tis midnight.
I’ll go arm myself.
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant prince.
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.
He will keep that good name still.
I know him to be valiant.
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
What’s he?
Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared not who knew it.
He needs not.
It is no hidden virtue in him.
Ill will never said well.
I will cap that proverb with “There is flattery in friendship.
And I will take up that with “Give the devil his due.
”
Well placed; there stands your friend for the devil.
Have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil.
You are the better at proverbs, by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.
You have shot over.
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Who hath measured the ground?
The Lord Grandpré.
A valiant and most expert gentleman.
Would it were day!
Alas, poor Harry of England!
He longs not for the dawning as we do.
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fat brained followers so far out of his knowledge.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
That they lack, for if their heads had any intellectual armor, they could never wear such heavy head pieces.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
You may as well say, that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
Now is it time to arm.
Come, shall we about it?
It is now two o'clock.
But, let me see, by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, The hum of either army stilly sounds, That the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other’s watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other’s umbered face.
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents The armorers, accomplishing the knights, With busy hammers closing rivets up, Give dreadful note of preparation.
Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in great danger.
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford.
God almighty, There is some soul of goodness in things evil, Would men observingly distill it out.
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers, Which is both healthful and good husbandry.
Besides, they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all, admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself.
Not so, my liege, this lodging likes me better, Since I may say, “Now lie I like a king.
'Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example.
So the spirit is eased.
And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt, The organs, though defunct and dead before, Break up their drowsy grave and newly move, With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
We shall, my liege.
Shall I attend your Grace?
No, my good knight.
Go with my brothers to my lords of England.
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
God a mercy, old heart, thou speak’st cheerfully.
Qui vous là?
A friend.
Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou base, common, and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?
Even so.
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
Then you are a better than the king.
Harry le Roy.
Le Roy?
A Cornish name.
Art thou of Cornish crew?
No, I am a Welshman.
Know’st thou Fluellen?
Yes.
Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy’s day.
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
Art thou his friend?
And his kinsman too.
The figo for thee then!
I thank you.
God be with you.
My name is Pistol called.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Captain Fluellen.
So.
In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer.
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept.
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s camp.
I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise.
Why, the enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, in your own conscience, now?
I will speak lower.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
Though it appear a little out of fashion, There is much care and valor in this Welshman.
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks yonder?
I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.
Who goes there?
A friend.
Under what captain serve you?
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the king?
No.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck ; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men’s lives saved.
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds.
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
That’s more than we know.
Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know enough if we know we are the king’s subjects.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?
Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.
So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him.
Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation.
But this is not so.
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.
The king is not to answer it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully, but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
You pay him then.
Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
I embrace it.
How shall I know thee again?
Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet.
Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.
Here’s my glove.
Give me another of thine.
There.
This will I also wear in my cap.
If ever thou come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
Thou dar’st as well be hanged.
Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the king’s company.
Keep thy word.
Fare thee well.
Be friends, you English fools, be friends.
We have French quarrels enough, if you could tell how to reckon.
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders.
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper.
Upon the king!
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins lay on the king!
We must bear all.
O hard condition, Twin born with greatness, subject to the breath Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, Seek through your camp to find you.
Good old knight, Collect them all together at my tent.
I’ll be before thee.
I shall do’t, my lord.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
Possess them not with fear.
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th' opposèd numbers Pluck their hearts from them.
Not today, O Lord, Oh, not today, think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown.
I Richard’s body have interrèd anew, And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood.
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood.
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard’s soul.
More will I do  Though all that I can do is nothing worth, Since that my penitence comes after all, Imploring pardon.
My liege.
My brother Gloucester’s voice.
Ay, I know thy errand.
I will go with thee.
The sun doth gild our armor.
Up, my lords.
Montez à cheval!
My horse, varlet!
Lackey!
O brave spirit!
Via les eaux et la terre.
Rien puis?
L'air et feu?
Cieux, cousin Orléans.
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides, That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage.
Ha!
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
How shall we then behold their natural tears?
The English are embattled, you French peers.
To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.
Do but behold yond poor and starvèd band, And your fair show shall suck away their souls, Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands, Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins To give each naked curtal axe a stain, That our French gallants shall today draw out And sheathe for lack of sport.
Let us but blow on them, The vapor of our valor will o'erturn them.
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones, Ill favoredly become the morning field.
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose, And our air shakes them passing scornfully.
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits, And give their fasting horses provender, And after fight with them?
I stay but for my guard.
On, to the field!
I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste.
Come, come away.
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
Where is the king?
The king himself is rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
There’s five to one.
Besides, they all are fresh.
God’s arm strike with us!
'Tis a fearful odds.
God be wi' you, princes all.
I’ll to my charge.
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven, Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford, My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu.
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
Farewell, kind lord.
Fight valiantly today.
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it, For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.
Oh, that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today.
What’s he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?
No, my fair cousin.
My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.
The French are bravely in their battles set, And will with all expedience charge on us.
All things are ready if our minds be so.
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
God’s will, my liege, would you and I alone, Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
Why, now thou hast unwished five thousand men, Which likes me better than to wish us one.
You know your places.
God be with you all.
Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry, If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound, Before thy most assurèd overthrow.
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted.
Besides, in mercy, The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance, that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where, wretches, their poor bodies Must lie and fester.
Who hath sent thee now?
The constable of France.
I pray thee, bear my former answer back.
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion’s skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves, upon the which, I trust, Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.
I shall, King Harry.
And so fare thee well.
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.
My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward.
Take it, brave York.
Now, soldiers, march away, And how Thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.
Yield, cur.
Je pense que vous êtes gentilhomme de bonne qualité.
Qualtitie calmie custure me.
Art thou a gentleman?
What is thy name?
Discuss.
Ô Seigneur Dieu!
O Seigneur Dew should be a gentleman.
Perpend my words, O Seigneur Dew, and mark : O Seigneur Dew, thou diest on point of fox, except, O Seigneur, thou do give to me egregious ransom.
Ô, prenez miséricorde!
Ayez pitié de moi!
Moy shall not serve.
I will have forty moys, or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat in drops of crimson blood.
Est il impossible d'Échapper la force de ton bras?
Brass, cur?
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat, offer’st me brass?
Ô, pardonnez moi!
Say’st thou me so?
Is that a ton of moys?
Come hither, boy.
Ask me this slave in French what is his name.
Écoutez.
Comment êtes vous appelé?
Monsieur le Fer.
He says his name is Master Fer.
Master Fer.
I’ll fer him, and firk him, and ferret him.
Discuss the same in French unto him.
I do not know the French for “fer,” and “ferret,” and “firk.
”
Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat.
Que dit il, monsieur?
Il me commande à vous dire que vous faites vous prêt, car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure de couper votre gorge.
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy, peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns, or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
Ô, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me pardoner.
Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison.
Gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents écus
What are his words?
He prays you to save his life.
He is a gentleman of a good house, and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns.
Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.
Petit monsieur, que dit il?
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardoner aucun prisonnier; néanmoins, pour les écus que vous lui avez promis, il est content à vous donner la liberté, le franchisement.
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercîments, et je m'estime heureux que j'ai tombé entre les mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave, vaillant, et très distingué seigneur d'Angleterre.
Expound unto me, boy.
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks, and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one , as he thinks, the most brave, valorous, and thrice  worthy seigneur of England.
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
Suivez vous le grand capitaine.
Ô diable!
Ô seigneur!
Le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!
Mort de ma vie, all is confounded, all!
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes.
Why, all our ranks are broke.
O perdurable shame!
Let’s stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
Let us die.
In once more!
Back again!
And he that will not follow Bourbon now, Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door, Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog, His fairest daughter is contaminate.
Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now.
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
The devil take order now!
I’ll to the throng.
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen, But all’s not done.
Yet keep the French the field.
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty.
Lives he, good uncle?
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie, Larding the plain, and by his bloody side, Yoke fellow to his honor owing wounds, The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over, Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face.
And cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.
I blame you not, For, hearing this, I must perforce compound With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.
Kill the poys and the luggage!
'Tis expressly against the law of arms.
'Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent, wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat.
Oh, ’tis a gallant king!
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
What call you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig was born?
Alexander the Great.
Why, I pray you, is not “pig” great?
The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn.
I tell you, Captain, if you look in the maps of the 'orld, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike.
There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth.
It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river.
But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both.
If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things.
Our king is not like him in that.
He never killed any of his friends.
It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished.
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it.
Sir John Falstaff.
That is he.
I’ll tell you, there is good men porn at Monmouth.
Here comes his Majesty.
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant.
Take a trumpet, herald.
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.
If they will fight with us, bid them come down, Or void the field.
They do offend our sight.
If they’ll do neither, we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings.
Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have, And not a man of them that we shall take Shall taste our mercy.
Go and tell them so.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
How now, what means this, herald?
Know’st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Com’st thou again for ransom?
No, great king.
I tell thee truly, herald, I know not if the day be ours or no, For yet a many of your horsemen peer And gallop o'er the field.
The day is yours.
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
What is this castle called that stands hard by?
They call it Agincourt.
Then call we this the field of Agincourt, Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
Your grandfather of famous memory, an’t please your Majesty, and your great uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in France.
They did, Fluellen.
Your Majesty says very true.
I wear it for a memorable honor, For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
All the water in Wye cannot wash your Majesty’s Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that: God pless it and preserve it as long as it pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.
Thanks, good my countryman.
By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman, I care not who know it.
I will confess it to all the 'orld.
I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
God keep me so.
Our heralds go with him.
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts.
Call yonder fellow hither.
Soldier, you must come to the king.
Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap?
An’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.
An Englishman?
What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit this soldier keep his oath?
He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t please your Majesty, in my conscience.
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow and his oath.
If he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth, in my conscience, la.
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet’st the fellow.
So I will, my liege, as I live.
Who serv’st thou under?
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars.
Call him hither to me, soldier.
I will, my liege.
Here, Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap.
When Alençon and myself were down together, I plucked this glove from his helm.
If any man challenge this, he is a friend to Alençon and an enemy to our person.
If thou encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects.
Know’st thou Gower?
He is my dear friend, an please you.
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
I will fetch him.
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.
The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.
It is the soldier’s.
I by bargain should Wear it myself.
Follow, good cousin Warwick.
I warrant it is to knight you, Captain.
God’s will and His pleasure, Captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the king.
There is more good toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.
Sir, know you this glove?
Know the glove!
I know the glove is a glove.
I know this, and thus I challenge it.
'Sblood, an arrant traitor as any ’s in the universal world, or in France, or in England!
How now, sir?
You villain!
Do you think I’ll be forsworn?
Stand away, Captain Gower.
I will give treason his payment into plows, I warrant you.
I am no traitor.
That’s a lie in thy throat.
I charge you in his Majesty’s name, apprehend him.
He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s.
How now, how now, what’s the matter?
How now, what’s the matter?
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it.
Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is.
Give me thy glove, soldier.
Look, here is the fellow of it.
'Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike, And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
An please your Majesty, let his neck answer for it, if there is any martial law in the world.
How canst thou make me satisfaction?
All offenses, my lord, come from the heart.
Never came any from mine that might offend your Majesty.
It was ourself thou didst abuse.
Your Majesty came not like yourself.
You appeared to me but as a common man.
Witness the night, your garments, your lowliness.
And what your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had you been as I took you for, I made no offense.
Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns And give it to this fellow.
Keep it, fellow, And wear it for an honor in thy cap Till I do challenge it.
Give him the crowns.
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.
By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle enough in his belly.
Hold, there is twelve pence for you, and I pray you to serve God and keep you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for you.
I will none of your money.
It is with a good will.
I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes.
Come, wherefore should you be so pashful?
Your shoes is not so good.
'Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.
Now, herald, are the dead numbered?
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.
What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?
Charles, duke of Orléans, nephew to the king; John, duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt.
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires, Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain.
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead One hundred twenty six.
Added to these, Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen, Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which, Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.
So that in these ten thousand they have lost, There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries.
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead: Charles Delabreth, high constable of France; Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France; The Master of the Crossbows, Lord Rambures; Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dauphin; John, duke of Alençon; Anthony, duke of Brabant, The brother of the duke of Burgundy,
'Tis wonderful.
Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to tell how many is killed?
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement: That God fought for us.
Yes, my conscience, He did us great good.
Do we all holy rites.
Nay, that’s right.
But why wear you your leek today?
Saint Davy’s day is past.
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.
I will tell you as my friend, Captain Gower.
The rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek.
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey cock.
'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his turkey cocks.
God pless you, Aunchient Pistol, you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you.
Ha, art thou bedlam?
Dost thou thirst, base Trojan, to have me fold up Parca’s fatal web?
Hence.
I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look you, this leek.
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
There is one goat for you.
Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it?
Base Trojan, thou shalt die.
You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is.
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals.
Come, there is sauce for it.
You called me yesterday “mountain squire,” but I will make you today a squire of low degree.
I pray you, fall to.
If you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.
Enough, Captain.
You have astonished him.
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek, or I will peat his pate four days.
Bite, I pray you.
It is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.
Must I bite?
Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question, too, and ambiguities.
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge.
I eat and eat, I swear
Eat, I pray you.
Will you have some more sauce to your leek?
There is not enough leek to swear by.
Quiet thy cudgel.
Thou dost see I eat.
Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.
Nay, pray you throw none away.
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.
When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em, that is all.
Good.
Ay, leeks is good.
Hold you, there is a groat to heal your pate.
Me, a groat?
Yes, verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.
I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.
If I owe you anything, I will pay you in cudgels.
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels.
God be wi' you and keep you and heal your pate.
All hell shall stir for this.
Go, go.
You are a counterfeit cowardly knave.
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor, and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words?
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice.
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel.
You find it otherwise, and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition.
Fare you well.
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
News have I that my Nell is dead i' th' spital Of a malady of France, And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled.
Well, bawd I’ll turn, And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I’ll steal.
And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars, And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
Unto our brother France and to our sister, Health and fair time of day.
Right joyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England.
Fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
So happy be the issue, brother England, Of this good day and of this gracious meeting, As we are now glad to behold your eyes  Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them Against the French that met them in their bent The fatal balls of murdering basilisks.
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality, and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
To cry “Amen” to that, thus we appear.
You English princes all, I do salute you.
My duty to you both, on equal love, Great kings of France and England.
That I have labored With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors, To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview, Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
Since, then, my office hath so far prevailed That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted.
If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace, Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections Which you have cited, you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands, Whose tenors and particular effects You have, enscheduled briefly, in your hands.
The king hath heard them, to the which as yet There is no answer made.
Well then, the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer.
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles.
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them, we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother, we shall.
Go, uncle Exeter, And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester, Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king And take with you free power to ratify, Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity, Anything in or out of our demands, And we’ll consign thereto.
Will you, fair sister, Go with the princes or stay here with us?
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urged be stood on.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
She is our capital demand, comprised Within the forerank of our articles.
She hath good leave.
Fair Katherine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart?
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.
Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez moi, I cannot tell what is “like me.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Que dit il?
Que je suis semblable à les anges?
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grâce, ainsi dit il.
I said so, dear Katherine; and I must not blush to affirm it.
Ô bon Dieu!
Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
What says she, fair one?
That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits; dat is de princess.
The princess is the better Englishwoman.
I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.
I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you.
Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me.
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.
I will have it all mine.
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
I cannot tell wat is dat.
No, Kate?
I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly to be shook off.
Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi  let me see, what then?
Saint Denis be my speed!
donc vôtre est France et vous êtes mienne.
It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French.
I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.
No, faith, is ’t not, Kate, but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one.
But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English?
Canst thou love me?
I cannot tell.
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?
I’ll ask them.
Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart.
But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly.
If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder.
Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
Shall we not?
What say’st thou, my fair flower de luce?
I do not know dat.
No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise.
Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor.
How answer you, la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?
Your Majestée ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Now fie upon my false French.
By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate.
By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage.
Now, beshrew my father’s ambition!
He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them.
But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.
Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better.
And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me?
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon père.
Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.
Den it sall also content me.
Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez!
Ma foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d'une Notre Seigneur!
indigne serviteur.
Excusez moi, je vous supplie, mon très puissant seigneur.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.
To kiss.
Your Majesté entendre bettre que moi.
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?
Oui, vraiment.
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find  faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.
Therefore, patiently and yielding.
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate.
There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council, and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs.
Here comes your father.
God save your Majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
Is she not apt?
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that .
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer.
And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.
As love is, my lord, before it loves.
It is so.
And you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid, for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered.
Shall Kate be my wife?
So please you.
I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her.
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
Is ’t so, my lords of England?
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
England ne'er had a king until his time.
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
Unto the French the dreadful judgement day So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought: The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
The church!
where is it?
My honourable lords, health to you all!
What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
Is Paris lost?
is Rouen yielded up?
If Henry were recall'd to life again, These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
How were they lost?
What treachery was used?
No treachery; but want of men and money.
Were our tears wanting to this funeral, These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
Give me my steeled coat.
I'll fight for France.
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes, To weep their intermissive miseries.
Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.
The Dauphin crowned king!
All fly to him!
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts, Wherewith already France is overrun.
What!
Wherein Talbot overcame?
Is't so?
O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown: The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
Is Talbot slain?
Then I will slay myself, For living idly here in pomp and ease, Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid, Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
I do remember it; and here take my leave, To go about my preparation.
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can, To view the artillery and munition; And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
Each hath his place and function to attend: I am left out; for me nothing remains.
Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
Sound, sound alarum!
we will rush on them.
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
Him I forgive my death that killeth me When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
Who ever saw the like?
What men have I!
Dogs!
cowards!
Froissart, a countryman of ours, records, England all Olivers and Rowlands bred, During the time Edward the Third did reign.
More truly now may this be verified; For none but Samsons and Goliases It sendeth forth to skirmish.
One to ten!
Lean, raw boned rascals!
who would e'er suppose They had such courage and audacity?
Be it so.
Where's the Prince Dauphin?
I have news for him.
Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd: Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
Go, call her in.
Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
Where is the Dauphin?
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter, My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
Stay, stay thy hands!
thou art an Amazon And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock; Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
My lord, where are you?
What devise you on?
Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
Helen, the mother of great Constantine, Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth, How may I reverently worship thee enough?
Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
First Serving Man It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.
First Serving Man Villains, answer you so the lord protector?
The Lord protect him!
so we answer him: We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
Who willed you?
Or whose will stands but mine?
There's none protector of the realm but I.
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
What noise is this?
What traitors have we here?
Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
Faint hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate, Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
How now, ambitious Humphry!
What means this?
Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.
What!
am I dared and bearded to my face?
Draw, men, for all this privileged place; Blue coats to tawny coats.
Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.
Winchester goose, I cry, a rope!
a rope!
Fie, lords!
That you, being supreme magistrates, Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
Peace, mayor!
I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.
This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head; For I intend to have it ere long.
See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
I myself fight not once in forty year.
Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged, And how the English have the suburbs won.
Father, I know; and oft have shot at them, Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
But now thou shalt not.
Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
How wert thou handled being prisoner?
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.
And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
For aught I see, this city must be famish'd, Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
What stir is this?
What tumult's in the heavens?
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them: A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
Here, here she comes.
Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
But I will chastise this high minded strumpet.
O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.
Hark, countrymen!
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires And feast and banquet in the open streets, To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
All France will be replete with mirth and joy, When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
Sergeant, you shall.
Thus are poor servitors, When others sleep upon their quiet beds, Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
Coward of France!
How much he wrongs his fame, Despairing of his own arm's fortitude, To join with witches and the help of hell!
Traitors have never other company.
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
A maid, they say.
A maid!
and be so martial!
Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.
Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
And I to this.
And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right Of English Henry , shall this night appear How much in duty I am bound to both.
Arm!
Arm!
The enemy doth make assault!
How now, my lords!
What, all unready so?
Unready!
Ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds, Hearing alarums at our chamber doors.
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms, Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise More venturous or desperate than this.
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.
Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal, Make us partakers of a little gain, That now our loss might be ten times so much?
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
At all times will you have my power alike?
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail, Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
Improvident soldiers!
had your watch been good, This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
Had all your quarters been as safely kept As that whereof I had the government, We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
Mine was secure.
And so was mine, my lord.
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
The day begins to break, and night is fled, Whose pitchy mantle over veil'd the earth.
Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury, And here advance it in the market place, The middle centre of this cursed town.
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds, They did amongst the troops of armed men Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
Myself, as far as I could well discern For smoke and dusky vapours of the night, Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull, When arm in arm they both came swiftly running, Like to a pair of loving turtle doves That could not live asunder day or night.
After that things are set in order here, We'll follow them with all the power we have.
All hail, my lords!
Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
Is it even so?
Nay, then, I see our wars Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport, When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
Well then, alone, since there's no remedy, I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
Come hither, captain.
You perceive my mind?
I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.
Madam, I will.
Madam, According as your ladyship desired, By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
And he is welcome.
What!
Is this the man?
Madam, it is.
Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad That with his name the mothers still their babes?
What means he now?
Go ask him whither he goes.
If thou be he, then thou art a prisoner.
Prisoner!
To whom?
Ha, ha, ha!
Laughest thou, wretch?
Thy mirth shall turn to moan.
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow Whereon to practise your severity.
Why, art not thou the man?
I am indeed.
Then have I substance too.
That will I show you presently.
How say you, madam?
Are you now persuaded That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength, With which he yoketh your rebellious necks, Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate.
Victorious Talbot!
Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
Within the Temple hall we were too loud; The garden here is more convenient.
Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth; Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
Faith, I have been a truant in the law, And never yet could frame my will to it; And therefore frame the law unto my will.
Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
And on my side it is so well apparell'd, So clear, so shining and so evident That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer, But dare maintain the party of the truth, Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
I love no colours, and without all colour Of base insinuating flattery I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset And say withal I think he held the right.
Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more, Till you conclude that he upon whose side The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
Good Master Vernon, it is well objected: If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
And I.
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off, Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red And fall on my side so, against your will.
If I my lord, for my opinion bleed, Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt And keep me on the side where still I am.
Well, well, come on: who else?
Unless my study and my books be false, The argument you held was wrong in you:
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
Here in my scabbard, meditating that Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses; For pale they look with fear, as witnessing The truth on our side.
Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth; Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses, That shall maintain what I have said is true, Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
Away, away, good William de la Pole!
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
By him that made me, I'll maintain my words On any plot of ground in Christendom.
Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge, For treason executed in our late king's days?
And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted, Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still; And know us by these colours for thy foes, For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose, As cognizance of my blood drinking hate, Will I for ever and my faction wear, Until it wither with me to my grave Or flourish to the height of my degree.
Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!
And so farewell until I meet thee next.
Have with thee, Pole.
Farewell, ambitious Richard.
How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
This blot that they object against your house Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you, That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
In your behalf still will I wear the same.
And so will I.
Thanks, gentle sir.
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
Even like a man new haled from the rack, So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
Poor gentleman!
his wrong doth equal mine.
My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used, Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
First, lean thine aged back against mine arm; And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine, Was cursed instrument of his decease.
Discover more at large what cause that was, For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
I will, if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done.
Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
O, uncle, would some part of my young years Might but redeem the passage of your age!
Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast; And what I do imagine let that rest.
Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself Will see his burial better than his life.
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines, With written pamphlets studiously devised, Humphrey of Gloucester?
Presumptuous priest!
Gloucester, I do defy thee.
Lords, vouchsafe To give me hearing what I shall reply.
If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse, As he will have me, how am I so poor?
Or how haps it I seek not to advance Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
And for dissension, who preferreth peace More than I do?
except I be provoked.
As good!
Thou bastard of my grandfather!
Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray, But one imperious in another's throne?
Am I not protector, saucy priest?
And am not I a prelate of the church?
Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps And useth it to patronage his theft.
Unreverent Gloucester!
Thou art reverent Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
Rome shall remedy this.
Roam thither, then.
My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
Methinks my lord should be religious And know the office that belongs to such.
Methinks his lordship should be humbler; it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
Is not his grace protector to the king?
What tumult's this?
An uproar, I dare warrant, Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
We command you, based on your loyalty to us, to stop your murdering hands and to maintain peace.
Stay, stay, I say!
And if you love me, as you say you do, Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
Or who should study to prefer a peace.
He shall submit, or I will never yield.
Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke Hath banish'd moody discontented fury, As by his smoothed brows it doth appear: Why look you still so stern and tragical?
Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
Fie, uncle Beaufort!
I have heard you preach That malice was a great and grievous sin; And will not you maintain the thing you teach, But prove a chief offender in the same?
So help me God, as I intend it not!
I'll to the surgeon's.
And so will I.   third SERVING MAN And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
Let Richard be restored to his blood; So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.
If Richard will be true, not that alone But all the whole inheritance I give That doth belong unto the house of York, From whence you spring by lineal descent.
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
And as my duty springs, so perish they That grudge one thought against your majesty!
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!
Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes; For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
Your ships already are in readiness.
Ay, we may march in England or in France, Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city, And we be lords and rulers over Rouen; Therefore we'll knock.
Qui est la?
Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
Now shine it like a comet of revenge, A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends; Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!  '
presently, And then do execution on the watch.
France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears, If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress, Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares, That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
Good morrow, gallants!
want ye corn for bread?
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
What will you do, good grey beard?
break a lance, And run a tilt at death within a chair?
Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite, Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
Are ye so hot, sir?
God speed the parliament!
who shall be the speaker?
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
I speak not to that railing Hecate, But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest; Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
Signior, no.
Signior, hang!
base muleters of France!
Like peasant foot boys do they keep the walls And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
Away, captains!
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
But, ere we go, regard this dying prince, The valiant Duke of Bedford.
Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
Whither away!
to save myself by flight: We are like to have the overthrow again.
What!
will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?
Cowardly knight!
ill fortune follow thee!
Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please, For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
They that of late were daring with their scoffs Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
Lost, and recover'd in a day again!
Thanks, gentle duke.
But where is Pucelle now?
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
But yet, before we go, let's not forget The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased, But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
We have been guided by thee hitherto, And of thy cunning had no diffidence: One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
Search out thy wit for secret policies, And we will make thee famous through the world.
For ever should they be expulsed from France And not have title of an earldom here.
Your honours shall perceive how I will work To bring this matter to the wished end.
Hark!
by the sound of drum you may perceive Their powers are marching unto Paris ward.
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread, And all the troops of English after him.
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his: Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
What say'st thou, Charles?
for I am marching hence.
Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.
Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.
Speak on; but be not over tedious.
Look on thy country, look on fertile France, And see the cities and the towns defaced By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words, Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee, Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
When Talbot hath set footing once in France And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill, Who then but English Henry will be lord And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!
Welcome, brave duke!
thy friendship makes us fresh.
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester, That hath so long been resident in France?
Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
When I was young, as yet I am not old, I do remember how my father said A stouter champion never handled sword.
Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage The envious barking of your saucy tongue Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
Why, what is he?
as good a man as York.
Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.
Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.
God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!
My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais, To haste unto your coronation, A letter was deliver'd to my hands, Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
Which I have done, because unworthily Thou wast installed in that high degree.
To say the truth, this fact was infamous And ill beseeming any common man, Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
And now, my lord protector, view the letter Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?
No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!  '
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
What!
He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him And give him chastisement for this abuse.
How say you, my lord?
are you not content?
Content, my liege!
Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.
This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.
And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.
Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.
And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out, Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
Let this dissension first be tried by fight, And then your highness shall command a peace.
There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
Confirm it so!
Confounded be your strife!
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed With this immodest clamorous outrage To trouble and disturb the king and us?
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well To bear with their perverse objections; Much less to take occasion from their mouths
It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.
My Lord of York, I promise you, the king Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
An if I wist he did,  but let it rest; Other affairs must now be managed.
Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice; For, had the passions of thy heart burst out, I fear we should have seen decipher'd there More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils, Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees This jarring discord of nobility, This shouldering of each other in the court, This factious bandying of their favourites, But that it doth presage some ill event.
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands; But more when envy breeds unkind division; There comes the rain, there begins confusion.
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter: Summon their general unto the wall.
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death, Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
Hark!
hark!
the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell, Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul; And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.
Are not the speedy scouts return'd again, That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
A plague upon that villain Somerset, That thus delays my promised supply Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid, And I am lowted by a traitor villain And cannot help the noble chevalier: God comfort him in this necessity!
If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.
O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word; We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get; All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul; And on his son young John, who two hours since I met in travel toward his warlike father!
This seven years did not Talbot see his son; And now they meet where both their lives are done.
How now, Sir William!
whither were you sent?
Whither, my lord?
York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims; Swearing that you withhold his levied host, Collected for this expedition.
If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!
His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
O young John Talbot!
I did send for thee To tutor thee in stratagems of war, That Talbot's name might be in thee revived When sapless age and weak unable limbs Should bring thy father to his drooping c hair.
But, O malignant and ill boding stars!
Is my name Talbot?
and am I your son?
And shall I fly?
Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
He that flies so will ne'er return again.
If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
Upon my blessing, I command thee go.
To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.
Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
No part of him but will be shame in me.
Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?
Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
You cannot witness for me, being slain.
If death be so apparent, then both fly.
And leave my followers here to fight and die?
My age was never tainted with such shame.
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
Saint George and victory!
fight, soldiers, fight.
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word And left us to the rage of France his sword.
Where is John Talbot?
Pause, and take thy breath; I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done, Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late, To my determined time thou gavest new date.
When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire, It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire Of bold faced victory.
Then leaden age, Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage, Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy, And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
Where is my other life?
mine own is gone; O, where's young Talbot?
where is valiant John?
O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in, We should have found a bloody day of this.
Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.
O, no, forbear!
for that which we have fled During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent, To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.
On what submissive message art thou sent?
Submission, Dauphin!
For prisoners ask'st thou?
hell our prison is.
But tell me whom thou seek'st.
Here is a silly stately style indeed!
The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath, Writes not so tedious a style as this.
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles Stinking and fly blown lies here at our feet.
Go, take their bodies hence.
I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.
And now to Paris, in this conquering vein: All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.
Have you perused the letters from the pope, The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?
I have, my lord: and their intent is this: They humbly sue unto your excellence To have a godly peace concluded of Between the realms of England and of France.
How doth your grace affect their motion?
Marriage, uncle!
alas, my years are young!
And fitter is my study and my books Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
What!
is my Lord of Winchester install'd, And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
Then I perceive that will be verified Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy, 'If once he come to be a cardinal, He'll make his cap co equal with the crown.  '
My lords ambassadors, your several suits Have been consider'd and debated on.
And therefore are we certainly resolved To draw conditions of a friendly peace; Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean Shall be transported presently to France.
And for the proffer of my lord your master, I have inform'd his highness so at large As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts, Her beauty and the value of her dower, He doth intend she shall be England's queen.
In argument and proof of which contract, Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
And so, my lord protector, see them guarded And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.
Now Winchester will not submit, I trow, Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France, And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us; Else, ruin combat with their palaces!
Success unto our valiant general, And happiness to his accomplices!
What tidings send our scouts?
I prithee, speak.
The English army, that divided was Into two parties, is now conjoined in one, And means to give you battle presently.
Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is; But we will presently provide for them.
Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.
You speedy helpers, that are substitutes Under the lordly monarch of the north, Appear and aid me in this enterprise.
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd Out of the powerful regions under earth, Help me this once, that France may get the field.
O, hold me not with silence over long!
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood, I'll lop a member off and give it you In earnest of further benefit, So you do condescend to help me now.
No hope to have redress?
My body shall Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
Cannot my body nor blood sacrifice Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
Then take my soul, my body, soul and all, Before that England give the French the foil.
See, they forsake me!
Now the time is come That France must vail her lofty plumed crest And let her head fall into England's lap.
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man; No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
And may ye both be suddenly surprised By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!
I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile.
Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.
Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!
Margaret my name, and daughter to a king, The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.
O, stay!
Say, Earl of Suffolk  if thy name be so   What ransom must I pay before I pass?
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit, Before thou make a trial of her love?
Why speak'st thou not?
what ransom must I pay?
She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd; She is a woman, therefore to be won.
Wilt thou accept of ransom?
yea, or no.
Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife; Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
And yet a dispensation may be had.
And yet I would that you would answer me.
I'll win this Lady Margaret.
For whom?
Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!
He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
What though I be enthrall'd?
he seems a knight, And will not any way dishonour me.
Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French; And then I need not crave his courtesy.
Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause
Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
Lady, wherefore talk you so?
I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.
Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
To be a queen in bondage is more vile Than is a slave in base servility; For princes should be free.
And so shall you, If happy England's royal king be free.
Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen, To put a golden sceptre in thy hand And set a precious crown upon thy head, If thou wilt condescend to be my
What?
His love.
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
No, gentle madam; I unworthy am To woo so fair a dame to be his wife, And have no portion in the choice myself.
How say you, madam, are ye so content?
An if my father please, I am content.
Then call our captains and our colours forth.
And, madam, at your father's castle walls We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.
See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!
To whom?
To me.
Suffolk, what remedy?
I am a soldier, and unapt to weep, Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
Fair Margaret knows That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.
Upon thy princely warrant, I descend To give thee answer of thy just demand.
And here I will expect thy coming.
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth To be the princely bride of such a lord; Upon condition I may quietly Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou, Free from oppression or the stroke of war, My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
And I again, in Henry's royal name, As deputy unto that gracious king, Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.
Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks, Because this is in traffic of a king.
And yet, methinks, I could be well content To be mine own attorney in this case.
I'll over then to England with this news, And make this marriage to be solemnized.
I do embrace thee, as I would embrace The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.
Such commendations as becomes a maid, A virgin and his servant, say to him.
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
But madam, I must trouble you again; No loving token to his majesty?
Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart, Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
And this withal.
O, wert thou for myself!
Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
Have I sought every country far and near, And, now it is my chance to find thee out, Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
Decrepit miser!
base ignoble wretch!
Out, out!
Graceless!
wilt thou deny thy parentage?
This argues what her kind of life hath been, Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
Peasant, avaunt!
You have suborn'd this man, Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
Wilt thou not stoop?
Now cursed be the time Of thy nativity!
I would the milk Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast, Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a field, I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
O, burn her, burn her!
Take her away; for she hath lived too long, To fill the world with vicious qualities.
Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity, That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
Now heaven forfend!
the holy maid with child!
Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live; Especially since Charles must father it.
Alencon!
that notorious Machiavel!
It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.
A married man!
that's most intolerable.
Why, here's a girl!
I think she knows not well, There were so many, whom she may accuse.
It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes, Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
Lord regent, I do greet your excellence With letters of commission from the king.
Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
After the slaughter of so many peers, So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers, That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their country's benefit, Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
Have we not lost most part of all the towns, By treason, falsehood and by treachery, Our great progenitors had conquered?
O Warwick, Warwick!
I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of France.
Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France, We come to be informed by yourselves What the conditions of that league must be.
Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poison'd voice, By sight of these our baleful enemies.
Must he be then as shadow of himself?
Adorn his temples with a coronet, And yet, in substance and authority, Retain but privilege of a private man?
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
Insulting Charles!
How say'st thou, Charles?
shall our condition stand?
It shall; Only reserved, you claim no interest In any of our towns of garrison.
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
So should I give consent to flatter sin.
Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
Her father is no better than an earl, Although in glorious titles he excel.
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do, Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower, Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
A dower, my lords!
disgrace not so your king, That he should be so abject, base and poor, To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes, As did the youthful Paris once to Greece, With hope to find the like event in love, But prosper better than the Trojan did.
Suffolk, arise.
Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
We thank you all.
My lord protector, so it please your grace, Here are the articles of contracted peace Between our sovereign and the French king Charles, For eighteen months concluded by consent.
'Imprimis, it is agreed between the French king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing.
Uncle, how now!
Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
'Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father, and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.  '
They please us well.
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse, This peroration with such circumstance?
For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
Now, by the death of Him that died for all, These counties were the keys of Normandy.
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate, That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
France should have torn and rent my very heart, Before I would have yielded to this league.
A proper jest, and never heard before, That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her!
She should have stayed in France and starved in France, Before
So, there goes our protector in a rage.
Why should he, then, protect our sovereign, He being of age to govern of himself?
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me, And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk, We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
This weighty business will not brook delay: I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector, Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land, And common profit of his country!
And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
Unto the main!
Why droops my lord, like over ripen'd corn, Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, As frowning at the favours of the world?
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth, Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
What seest thou there?
King Henry's diadem, Enchased with all the honours of the world?
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face, Until thy head be circled with the same.
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
What, is't too short?
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord, Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
And may that thought, when I imagine ill Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry, Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
What dream'd my lord?
Tell me, and I'll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
Tut, this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove Shall lose his head for his presumption.
What, what, my lord!
Are you so choleric With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's, Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
I go.
Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
Follow I must; I cannot go before, While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
What say'st thou?
Majesty!
I am but grace.
But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice, Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
What say'st thou, man?
Hast thou as yet conferr'd With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch, With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
And will they undertake to do me good?
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold; Marry, and shall.
But how now, Sir John Hume!
Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!
Jesu bless him!
Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.
I'll be the first, sure.
How now, fellow!
Would'st anything with me?
I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord protector.
'To my Lord Protector!  '
Are your supplications to his lordship?
Let me see them: what is thine?
Thy wife, too!
That's some wrong, indeed.
What's yours?
What's here!
'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the commons of Melford.  '
How now, sir knave!
Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.
Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.
What sayst thou?
Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown?
That my master was?
No, forsooth: my master said that he was, and that the king was an usurper.
Who is there?
And as for you, that love to be protected Under the wings of our protector's grace, Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
Away, base cullions!
Suffolk, let them go.
Come, let's be gone.
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise, Is this the fashion in the court of England?
Is this the government of Britain's isle, And this the royalty of Albion's king?
What shall King Henry be a pupil still Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
Am I a queen in title and in style, And must be made a subject to a duke?
Not all these lords do vex me half so much As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.
Madam, myself have limed a bush for her, And placed a quire of such enticing birds, That she will light to listen to the lays, And never mount to trouble you again.
So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me; For I am bold to counsel you in this.
Although we fancy not the cardinal, Yet must we join with him and with the lords, Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint Will make but little for his benefit.
So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last, And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
When it comes to me, my lords, I don't really care which one  Somerset or York.
If York has behaved badly in France, then don't make him regent.
If Somerset isn't worthy of the position, then York should be regent.
Don't discuss whether you are worthy or not.
Let others better than you speak, ambitious Warwick.
The cardinal isn't better than me pn the battlefield.
Everyone around you is better than you, Warwick.
Calm down, son!
Madam, the king is old enough to give us his opinion.
If he's old enough, why does your grace need to be protector of his excellence?
You have ruined the common people; the moneybags of the church are shrunken and poor because of your taxes.
Your luxurious buildings and your wife's dresses have cost a lot of public money.
Give me my fan.
I beg your pardon, madam.
Was it?
Sweet aunt, be quiet.
Lord cardinal, I'll follow Eleanor and watch out for Humphrey and what he's going to do next.
Now, lords, I calmed down as I walked around the quadrangle once, so I have come to talk about the government.
I can bear witness to that.
Calm yourself, stubborn Warwick!
Because he is a man accused of treason.
Does anyone accuse York of being a traitor?
Ah, hang me if I have ever spoken those words, my lord.
I humbly thank you, your royal majesty.
And I willingly accept the fight.
Ah, but my lord, I can't fight!
Take them away to prison; the day of the fight will be the last day of the next month.
Master Hume, we are ready for that.
Mother Jourdain, lay down on the floor and crawl on the ground.
John Southwell, you read.
Be patient, good lady.
Ask whatever you want.
"At first, about the king: what will happen to him?"
"What will happen to the Duke of Suffolk?"
He will die by water.
He should avoid castles.
Go down to the darkness and the burning lake!
Be gone, treacherous demon!
Thunder and lightning.
That's true, madam.
No reason at all.
We'll make sure that all your silly trinkets here are kept safe and ready to be shown as evidence in court.
Go away, all of you!
"Although the duke that Henry shall depose still lives, Henry will outlive him and he will die a violent death.  "
Please, my Lord of York, let me be the messenger.
I'm hoping I'll get a reward from him.
Believe me, lords, in seven years I haven't seen better entertainment than hunting waterbirds by using dogs.
No wonder, if your majesty allows me to say, that my lord protector's hawks soar so high above us.
My lord, it's your lowly and dishonorable brain that cannot fly higher than a bird can.
I thought as much.
He wants to be above the clouds.
Yes, my lord cardinal?
No ill will, sir.
Which bad man do you mean, my lord?
You, my lord!
Suffolk, England knows how disrespectful you are!
Please, be calm, good queen and don't encourage these enraged men.
Ah, holy uncle, how could it come to this?
Yes, if you dare to show up.
That's true, uncle.
I understand.
What's going on, uncle Gloucester?
"Doctor, heal yourself.
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
What means this noise?
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
A miracle!
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine, Within this half hour, hath received his sight; A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
Now, God be praised, that to believing souls Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
Here comes the townsmen on procession, To present your highness with the man.
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale, Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance, That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
Born blind, an't please your grace.
Ay, indeed, was he.
What woman is this?
His wife, an't like your worship.
Where wert thou born?
At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.
Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance, Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
What, art thou lame?
Ay, God Almighty help me!
How camest thou so?
A fall off of a tree.
A plum tree, master.
How long hast thou been blind?
Born so, master.
What, and wouldst climb a tree?
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons, And made me climb, with danger of my life.
A subtle knave!
But yet it shall not serve.
Say'st thou me so?
What colour is this cloak of?
Red, master; red as blood.
Why, that's well said.
What colour is my gown of?
Black, forsooth: coal black as jet.
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.
Never, before this day, in all his life.
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
Alas, master, I know not.
What's his name?
I know not.
Nor his?
No, indeed, master.
What's thine own name?
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
O master, that you could!
My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in your town, and things called whips?
Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.
Then send for one presently.
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by.
Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and run away.
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.
Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
I will, my lord.
Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet quickly.
Alas, master, what shall I do?
I am not able to stand.
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
It made me laugh to see the villain run.
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.
Let them be whipped through every market town, till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to day.
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
And so, my lord protector, by this means Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones, Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick, Our simple supper ended, give me leave In this close walk to satisfy myself, In craving your opinion of my title, Which is infallible, to England's crown.
My lord, I long to hear it at full.
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, As I have read, laid claim unto the crown; And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king, Who kept him in captivity till he died.
But to the rest.
His eldest sister, Anne, My mother, being heir unto the crown Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
We thank you, lords.
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself: Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick The greatest man in England but the king.
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee: I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
I see no reason why a king of years Should be to be protected like a child.
God and King Henry govern England's realm.
Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.
My staff?
Lords, let him go.
I never saw a fellow worse bested, Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant, The servant of this armourer, my lords.
And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour: drink, and fear not your man.
Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight for credit of the 'prentices.
Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.
Sirrah, what's thy name?
Peter, forsooth.
Peter!
What more?
Thump.
Thump!
Then see thou thump thy master well.
Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
Hold, Peter, hold!
I confess, I confess treason.
Take away his weapon.
Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in thy master's way.
O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?
O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud; And after summer evermore succeeds Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold: So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
Sirs, what's o'clock?
Ten, my lord.
So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
Now thou dost penance too.
Look how they gaze!
See how the giddy multitude do point, And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince, protector of this land, Methinks I should not thus be led along, Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back, And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deep fet groans.
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet, And when I start, the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread.
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world, Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
Ah, Nell, forbear!
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
This is close dealing.
Well, I will be there.
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
Art thou gone too?
All comfort go with thee!
Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady; According to that state you shall be used.
It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
Come, Stanley, shall we go?
Can you not see?
Or will ye not observe The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
With what a majesty he bears himself, How insolent of late he is become, How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
Did he not, contrary to form of law, Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
And did he not, in his protectorship, Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
Seems he a dove?
His feathers are but borrowed, For he's disposed as the hateful raven: Is he a lamb?
All health unto my gracious sovereign!
Welcome, Lord Somerset.
What news from France?
That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!
Cold news for me; for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
All happiness unto my lord the king!
Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest: A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France, And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay; By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
Is it but thought so?
What are they that think it?
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay, Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
I say no more than truth, so help me God!
In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of, That England was defamed by tyranny.
Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was protector, Pity was all the fault that was in me; For I should melt at an offender's tears, And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd, As if she had suborned some to swear False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
But I can give the loser leave to chide.
He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day: Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.
Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
Ah!
Thus King Henry throws away his crutch Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
Ah, that my fear were false!
Ah, that it were!
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best, Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
What, will your highness leave the parliament?
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
So that, by this, you would not have him die.
Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
Thrice noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.
And so say I.
And I and now we three have spoke it, It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
If York, with all his far fet policy, Had been the regent there instead of me, He never would have stay'd in France so long.
What, worse than nought?
Nay, then, a shame take all!
And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!
My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
I will, my lord, so please his majesty.
A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.
O that it were to do!
What have we done?
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
Here comes my lord.
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
Why, that's well said.
Go, get you to my house; I will reward you for this venturous deed.
The king and all the peers are here at hand.
Have you laid fair the bed?
Is all things well, According as I gave directions?
'Tis, my good lord.
Away!
Be gone.
I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
God forbid any malice should prevail, That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
How now!
Why look'st thou pale?
Why tremblest thou?
Where is our uncle?
What's the matter, Suffolk?
Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
Marry, God forfend!
How fares my lord?
Help, lords!
The king is dead.
Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
Run, go, help, help!
O Henry, ope thine eyes!
He doth revive again: madam, be patient.
O heavenly God!
How fares my gracious lord?
Comfort, my sovereign!
Gracious Henry, comfort!
What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
It is reported, mighty sovereign, That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
The commons, like an angry hive of bees That want their leader, scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge.
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny, Until they hear the order of his death.
That shall I do, my liege.
Stay, Salisbury, With the rude multitude till I return.
O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts, My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
If my suspect be false, forgive me, God, For judgment only doth belong to thee.
Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
As surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon him To free us from his father's wrathful curse, I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thrice famed duke.
A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
See how the blood is settled in his face.
Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection; And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe, But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest, But may imagine how the bird was dead, Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
Are you the butcher, Suffolk?
Where's your knife?
Is Beaufort term'd a kite?
Where are his talons?
What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller, Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
Blunt witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much, Thy mother took into her blameful bed
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood, If from this presence thou darest go with me.
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
What noise is this?
Why, how now, lords!
Your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence!
Dare you be so bold?
Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.
Sirs, stand apart; the king shall know your mind.
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me, Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death, Or banished fair England's territories, They will by violence tear him from your palace And torture him with grievous lingering death.
An answer from the king, my Lord of Salisbury!
An answer from the king, or we will all break in!
Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.
O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
Heart's discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company!
There's two of you; the devil make a third!
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
Cease, gentle queen, these execrations, And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
A plague upon them!
Wherefore should I curse them?
You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
O, let me entreat thee cease.
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished; Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
Wither goes Vaux so fast?
What news, I prithee?
Go tell this heavy message to the king.
Ay me!
What is this world!
What news are these!
Away!
Though parting be a fretful corrosive, It is applied to a deathful wound.
I go.
And take my heart with thee.
A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask That ever did contain a thing of worth.
Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we This way fall I to death.
This way for me.
How fares my lord?
Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.
If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure, Enough to purchase such another island, So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
Ah, what a sign it is of evil life, Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed?
Where should he die?
Can I make men live, whether they will or no?
O, torture me no more!
I will confess.
Alive again?
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
And from his bosom purge this black despair!
See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!
Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.
Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss, Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
He dies, and makes no sign.
O God, forgive him!
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
What is my ransom, master?
Let me know.
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns, And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.
And so will I and write home for it straight.
Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
How now!
Why start'st thou?
What, doth death affright?
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood, The honourable blood of Lancaster, Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
Bare headed plodded by my foot cloth mule And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
How often hast thou waited at my cup, Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board, When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side Strike off his head.
Thou darest not, for thy own.
Yes, Pole.
Pole?
Pool!
Sir Pool!
Lord!
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
Walter,
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
What, are ye daunted now?
Now will ye stoop?
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough, Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can, That this my death may never be forgot!
There let his head and lifeless body lie, Until the queen his mistress bury it.
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath; they have been up these two days.
They have the more need to sleep now, then.
I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
So he had need, for 'tis threadbare.
O miserable age!
Virtue is not regarded in handicrafts men.
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.
I see them!
I see them!
He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make dog's leather of.
And Dick the Butcher,
Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's throat cut like a calf.
And Smith the weaver,
Argo, their thread of life is spun.
Come, come, let's fall in with them.
We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,
Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.
For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with the spirit of putting down kings and princes,   Command silence.
Silence!
My father was a Mortimer,
He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer.
My mother a Plantagenet,
I knew her well; she was a midwife.
My wife descended of the Lacies,
She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and sold many laces.
But now of late, not able to travel with her furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.
Therefore am I of an honourable house.
Valiant I am.
A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.
I am able to endure much.
No question of that; for I have seen him whipped three market days together.
I fear neither sword nor fire.
But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.
Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows reformation.
God save your majesty!
The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
Nay, that I mean to do.
Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment?
That parchment, being scribbled o'er, should undo a man?
Some say the bee stings: but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.
How now!
Who's there?
O monstrous!
We took him setting of boys' copies.
Here's a villain!
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
Nay, then, he is a conjurer.
Nay, he can make obligations, and write court hand.
Emmanuel.
They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill go hard with you.
Let me alone.
Dost thou use to write thy name?
Or hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest plain dealing man?
Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up that I can write my name.
He hath confessed: away with him!
He's a villain and a traitor.
Away with him, I say!
Hang him with his pen and ink horn about his neck.
Where's our general?
Here I am, thou particular fellow.
Fly, fly, fly!
Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by, with the king's forces.
Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down.
No.
To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
Now have at him!
But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood, If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.
And Adam was a gardener.
And what of that?
Ay, sir.
By her he had two children at one birth.
That's false.
Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.
Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not.
And will you credit this base drudge's words, That speaks he knows not what?
Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
He lies, for I invented it myself.
And furthermore, we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine.
O gross and miserable ignorance!
No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail, Assail them with the army of the king.
And you that love the commons, follow me.
Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.
They are all in order and march toward us.
But then are we in order when we are most out of order.
Come, march forward.
Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
Here, sir.
I desire no more.
And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less.
and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels till I do come to London, where we will have the mayor's sword borne before us.
If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the gaols and let out the prisoners.
Fear not that, I warrant thee.
Come, let's march towards London.
What answer makes your grace to the rebels' supplication?
Ah, barbarous villains!
Hath this lovely face Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me, And could it not enforce them to relent, That were unworthy to behold the same?
Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
How now, madam!
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead, Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.
How now!
What news?
The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
O graceless men!
They know not what they do.
My gracious lord, return to Killingworth, Until a power be raised to put them down.
Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive, These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
Lord Say, the traitors hate thee; Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
So might your grace's person be in danger.
Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.
Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.
Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.
The trust I have is in mine innocence, And therefore am I bold and resolute.
How now!
Is Jack Cade slain?
Now is Mortimer lord of this city.
And here, sitting upon London stone, I charge and command that, of the city's cost, the pissing conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our reign .
And now henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer.
Jack Cade!
Jack Cade!
Knock him down there.
My lord, there's an army gathered together in Smithfield.
I have a suit unto your lordship.
Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.
Mass, 'twill be sore law, then; for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole yet.
Nay, John, it will be stinking law for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.
I have thought upon it, it shall be so.
Then we are like to have biting statutes, unless his teeth be pulled out.
And henceforward all things shall be in common.
My lord, a prize, a prize!
Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.
Ah, thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord!
Now art thou within point blank of our jurisdiction regal.
What canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the dauphin of France?
Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art.
What of that?
Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets.
And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example, that am a butcher.
You men of Kent,
What say you of Kent?
Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.  '
Away with him, away with him!
He speaks Latin.
Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
O monstrous coward!
What, to come behind folks?
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.
Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.
Why dost thou quiver, man?
The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.
Tell me wherein have I offended most?
Have I affected wealth or honour?
Speak.
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding, This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.
O, let me live!
It shall be done.
Ah, countrymen!
If when you make your prayers, God should be so obdurate as yourselves, How would it fare with your departed souls?
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
Away with him!
And do as I command ye.
My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills?
Marry, presently.
O, brave!
But is not this braver?
Let them kiss one another, for they loved well when they were alive.
Now part them again, lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France.
Up Fish Street!
Down Saint Magnus' Corner!
Kill and knock down!
Throw them into Thames!
What noise is this I hear?
Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?
What say ye, countrymen?
Will ye relent, And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you; Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon, Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!  '
Who hateth him and honours not his father, Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake, Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.
God save the king!
God save the king!
What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave?
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him?
Will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates, that you should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark?
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
A Clifford!
A Clifford!
We'll follow the king and Clifford.
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude?
The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me desolate.
I see them lay their heads together to surprise me.
My sword make way for me, for here is no staying.
In despite of the devils and hell, have through the very middest of you?
What, is he fled?
Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne, And could command no more content than I?
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle But I was made a king, at nine months old.
Was never subject long'd to be a king As I do long and wish to be a subject.
Health and glad tidings to your majesty!
Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?
Or is he but retired to make him strong?
Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates, To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
God save the king!
God save the king!
Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.
I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal As all things shall redound unto your good.
Fie on ambition!
Fie on myself, that have a sword, and yet am ready to famish!
Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court, And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
This small inheritance my father left me Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee simple without leave.
Brave thee!
Ay, by the best blood that ever was broached, and beard thee too.
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands, That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent, Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard!
Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails.
O, I am slain!
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory.
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
Whom have we here?
Buckingham, to disturb me?
The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
A messenger from Henry, our dread liege, To know the reason of these arms in peace; Or why thou, being a subject as I am, Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn, Should raise so great a power without his leave, Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us, That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
In all submission and humility York doth present himself unto your highness.
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence, And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade, Who since I heard to be discomfited.
The head of Cade!
Great God, how just art Thou!
I was, an't like your majesty.
How art thou call'd?
So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss He were created knight for his good service.
Iden, kneel down.
Rise up a knight.
We give thee for reward a thousand marks, And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head, But boldly stand and front him to his face.
How now!
Is Somerset at liberty?
Then, York, unloose thy long imprison'd thoughts, And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
False king!
Why hast thou broken faith with me, Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
King did I call thee?
O monstrous traitor!
I arrest thee, York, Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown; Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.
Wouldst have me kneel?
First let me ask of these, If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
I know, ere they will have me go to ward, They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
Call hither Clifford!
Bid him come amain, To say if that the bastard boys of York Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
O blood besotted Neapolitan, Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
See where they come: I'll warrant they'll make it good.
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his king.
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower, And chop away that factious pate of his.
Will you not, sons?
Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
Are these thy bears?
We'll bait thy bears to death.
And manacle the bear ward in their chains, If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader of thy brain sick son!
What, wilt thou on thy death bed play the ruffian, And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
O, where is faith?
O, where is loyalty?
My lord, I have consider'd with myself The title of this most renowned duke; And in my conscience do repute his grace The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
I have.
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
You were best to go to bed and dream again, To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest, The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff, This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet, As on a mountain top the cedar shows That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm, Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear And tread it under foot with all contempt, Despite the bear ward that protects the bear.
Fie!
Charity, for shame!
Speak not in spite, For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to night.
Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
How now, my noble lord?
What, all afoot?
Of one or both of us the time is come.
Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
What seest thou in me, York?
Why dost thou pause?
With thy brave bearing should I be in love, But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem, But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
So let it help me now against thy sword As I in justice and true right express it.
My soul and body on the action both!
A dreadful lay!
Address thee instantly.
La fin couronne les oeuvres.
Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!
Shame and confusion!
O, let the vile world end, And the premised flames of the last day Knit earth and heaven together!
Away, my lord!
You are slow; for shame, away!
Can we outrun the heavens?
Good Margaret, stay.
What are you made of?
After them!
Nay, before them, if we can.
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood, Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
And so do I.   Victorious Prince of York, Before I see thee seated in that throne Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will; For hither we have broken in by force.
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
And when the king comes, offer no violence, Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best, The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares: Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
What, shall we suffer this?
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
Ah, know you not the city favours them, And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
I am thine.
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry.
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
It must and shall be so: content thyself.
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
And Warwick shall disprove it.
You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And slew your fathers, and with colours spread March'd through the city to the palace gates.
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
Poor Clifford!
how I scorn his worthless threats!
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms, Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
Sons, peace!
Peace, thou!
and give King Henry leave to speak.
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne, Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
I know not what to say; my title's weak.
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
What then?
He rose against him, being his sovereign, And made him to resign his crown perforce.
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
What good is this to England and himself!
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
Nor I.
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
Be thou a prey unto the house of York, And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
Ah, Exeter!
Why should you sigh, my lord?
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son, Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
This oath I willingly take and will perform.
Long live King Henry!
Plantagenet embrace him.
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
And I unto the sea from whence I came.
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger: I'll steal away.
Exeter, so will I.
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man!
would I had died a maid And never seen thee, never borne thee son, Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Enforced thee!
art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak.
Ah, timorous wretch!
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
When I return with victory from the field I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
Poor queen!
how love to me and to her son Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
No, I can better play the orator.
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
Why, how now, sons and brother!
At a strife?
What is your quarrel?
How began it first?
No quarrel, but a slight contention.
About what?
About that which concerns your grace and us; The crown of England, father, which is yours.
Mine boy?
not till King Henry be dead.
Your right depends not on his life or death.
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
I shall be, if I claim by open war.
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
But, stay: what news?
Why comest thou in such post?
Ay, with my sword.
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
What, with five thousand men?
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need: A woman's general; what should we fear?
Five men to twenty!
Though the odds be great, I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
Chaplain, away!
Thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke, Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
And I, my lord, will bear him company.
Soldiers, away with him!
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child, Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
How now!
is he dead already?
Or is it fear That makes him close his eyes?
I'll open them.
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
Thy father hath.
But 'twas ere I was born.
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
Plantagenet!
I come, Plantagenet!
Ah, hark!
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
Hold, valiant Clifford!
for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
Hold, Clifford!
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty; So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
What would your grace have done unto him now?
That is my office, for my father's sake.
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
She wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill beseeming is it in thy sex To triumph, like an Amazonian trull, Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, visor like, unchanging, Made impudent with use of evil deeds, I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, Unless the adage must be verified, That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
Had he been slaughter man to all my kin, I should not for my life but weep with him.
What, weeping ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon the wrong he did us all, And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
And here's to right our gentle hearted king.
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
Off with his head, and set it on York gates; So York may overlook the town of York.
I cannot joy, until I be resolved Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about; And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
Ah, one that was a woeful looker on Whenas the noble Duke of York was slain, Your princely father and my loving lord!
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Environed he was with many foes, And stood against them, as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon, Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford!
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun: For "chair and dukedom," "throne and kingdom" say; Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
How now, fair lords!
What fare?
What news abroad?
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
O Warwick, Warwick!
That Plantagenet, Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption, Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out; And therefore comes my brother MONTAGUE.
Attend me, lords.
The proud insulting queen, With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, And of their feather many more proud birds, Have wrought the easy melting king like wax.
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean; And when thou fail'st  as God forbid the hour!
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
How now!
What news?
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck: To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God!
'Tis not my fault, Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
My gracious liege, this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on, And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, Inferring arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind; And would my father had left me no more!
My gracious father, by your kingly leave, I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, And in that quarrel use it to the death.
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
Be it with resolution then to fight.
Now, perjured Henry!
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
And reason too: Who should succeed the father but the son?
Are you there, butcher?
O, I cannot speak!
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
Why, how now, long tongued Warwick!
Dare you speak?
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last, Your legs did better service than your hands.
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
You said so much before, and yet you fled.
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain The execution of my big swoln heart Upon that Clifford, that cruel child killer.
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to day, That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head; For York in justice puts his armour on.
If that be right which Warwick says is right, There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands; For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, To make this shameless callet know herself.
And, in this resolution, I defy thee; Not willing any longer conference, Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets!
Let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.
Stay, Edward.
Smile, gentle heaven!
Or strike, ungentle death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
How now, my lord!
What hap?
What hope of good?
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Away, away!
Once more, sweet lords farewell.
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
O piteous spectacle!
O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens, Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
Woe above woe!
Grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
How will my mother for a father's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
How will the country for these woeful chances Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
Sad hearted men, much overgone with care, Here sits a king more woeful than you are.
Fly, father, fly!
For all your friends are fled, And Warwick rages like a chafed bull: Away!
For death doth hold us in pursuit.
Away!
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
I think his understanding is bereft.
O, would he did!
And so perhaps he doth: 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit, Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father.
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
What, not an oath?
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester; For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
Tut, that's a foolish observation: Richard, be Duke of Gloucester.
Now to London, To see these honours in possession.
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee: This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, For wise men say it is the wisest course.
Why linger we?
Let us lay hands upon him.
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
But did you never swear, and break an oath?
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Here in this country, where we now remain.
No; For we were subjects but while you were king.
Why, am I dead?
Do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
So would you be again to Henry, If he were seated as King Edward is.
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's, To go with us unto the officers.
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit; It were dishonour to deny it her.
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
Yea, is it so?
I see the lady hath a thing to grant, Before the king will grant her humble suit.
He knows the game: how true he keeps the wind!
Silence!
Ay, widow?
Then I'll warrant you all your lands, An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.
God forbid that!
For he'll take vantages.
How many children hast thou, widow?
Tell me.
I think he means to beg a child of her.
Nay, whip me then: he'll rather give her two.
Three, my most gracious lord.
You shall have four, if you'll be ruled by him.
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
And would you not do much to do them good?
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
Therefore I came unto your majesty.
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
What you command, that rests in me to do.
But you will take exceptions to my boon.
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
As red as fire!
nay, then her wax must melt.
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
But now you partly may perceive my mind.
My mind will never grant what I perceive Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit: Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.  '
Then, no, my lord.
My suit is at an end.
The widow likes him not, she knits her brows.
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends; And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shift.
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
To whom, my lord?
Why, Clarence, to myself.
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
By so much is the wonder in extremes.
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken, And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, To cross me from the golden time I look for!
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak.
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm, While we bethink a means to break it off.
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
Welcome, brave Warwick!
What brings thee to France?
If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
Injurious Margaret!
And why not queen?
Because thy father Henry did usurp; And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse, You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years; a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right, Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame!
Leave Henry, and call Edward king.
And I the house of York.
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, Is Edward your true king?
For I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
But is he gracious in the people's eye?
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
Then further, all dissembling set aside, Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona.
Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
To Edward, but not to the English king.
Deceitful Warwick!
It was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit: Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace, Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears, Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love; For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
My lord ambassador, these letters are for you, Sent from your brother, Marquess MONTAGUE.
These from our king unto your majesty.
And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled: I hope all's for the best.
Warwick, what are thy news?
And yours, fair queen?
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
What!
Has your king married the Lady Grey!
And now, to soothe your forgery and his, Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers, I'll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen?
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live, Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid.
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
Then, England's messenger, return in post, And tell false Edward, thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride: Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside, And I am ready to put armour on.
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's thy reward: be gone.
This shall assure my constant loyalty, That if our queen and this young prince agree, I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Why stay we now?
These soldiers shall be levied, And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral, Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance, For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
And his well chosen bride.
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice, That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick, Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
And shall have your will, because our king: Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And you too, Somerset and MONTAGUE, Speak freely what you think.
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis Becomes your enemy, for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise?
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth 'Gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage.
Why, knows not MONTAGUE that of itself England is safe, if true within itself?
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
Ay, what of that?
It was my will and grant; And for this once my will shall stand for law.
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
Alas, poor Clarence!
Is it for a wife That thou art malcontent?
I will provide thee.
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king, And not be tied unto his brother's will.
I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
Now, messenger, what letters or what news From France?
At my depart, these were his very words: 'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride.  '
Is Lewis so brave?
Belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain: 'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.  '
I blame not her, she could say little less; She had the wrong.
But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she was there in place.
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, And I am ready to put armour on.  '
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?
He, more incensed against your majesty Than all the rest, discharged me with these words: 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.  '
Ha!
durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; And haste is needful in this desperate case.
But, ere I go, Hastings and MONTAGUE, Resolve my doubt.
So God help MONTAGUE as he proves true!
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
Why, so!
Then am I sure of victory.
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour, Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
Fear not that, my lord.
What, will he not to bed?
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
To morrow then belike shall be the day, If Warwick be so near as men report.
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that That with the king here resteth in his tent?
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
O, is it so?
But why commands the king That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field?
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent, But to defend his person from night foes?
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Courage, my masters!
Honour now or never!
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
Who goes there?
Stay, or thou diest!
What are they that fly there?
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
The duke!
Why, Warwick, when we parted, Thou call'dst me king.
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
What now remains, my lords, for us to do But march to London with our soldiers?
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; To free King Henry from imprisonment And see him seated in the regal throne.
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
What!
Loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
No, but the loss of his own royal person.
Then is my sovereign slain?
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither, Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Brother, the time and case requireth haste: Your horse stands ready at the park corner.
But whither shall we then?
To Lynn, my lord, And ship from thence to Flanders.
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
But wherefore stay we?
'Tis no time to talk.
Huntsman, what say'st thou?
Wilt thou go along?
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat, And turn'd my captive state to liberty, My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
For what, lieutenant?
For well using me?
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent; For on thy fortune I repose myself.
What else?
And that succession be determined.
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that, Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
Come hither, England's hope.
What news, my friend?
That Edward is escaped from your brother, And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
Unsavoury news!
But how made he escape?
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide A salve for any sore that may betide.
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, 'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
The gates made fast!
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming, And shut the gates for safety of ourselves; For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king, Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom, As being well content with that alone.
But when the fox hath once got in his nose, He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
Ay, say you so?
The gates shall then be open'd.
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut But in the night or in the time of war.
What!
Fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For Edward will defend the town and thee, And all those friends that deign to follow me.
Welcome, Sir John!
But why come you in arms?
To help King Edward in his time of storm, As every loyal subject ought to do.
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget Our title to the crown and only claim Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
What talk you of debating?
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim: Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
Away with scrupulous wit!
Now arms must rule.
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand: The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of England and France, and lord of Ireland, & c.
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right, By this I challenge him to single fight.
Long live Edward the Fourth!
What counsel, lords?
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
A little fire is quickly trodden out; Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
Well minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
Sweet Oxford, and my loving MONTAGUE, And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine.
Hark, hark, my lord!
What shouts are these?
Away betimes, before his forces join, And take the great grown traitor unawares: Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
How far off is our brother MONTAGUE?
Where is the post that came from MONTAGUE?
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
At Southam I did leave him with his forces, And do expect him here some two hours hence.
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
Who should that be?
Belike, unlook'd for friends.
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
O unbid spite!
Is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced, That we could hear no news of his repair?
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own, Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
I thought, at least, he would have said the king; Or did he make the jest against his will?
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight: And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again; And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
O cheerful colours!
See where Oxford comes!
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
The gates are open, let us enter too.
So other foes may set upon our backs.
O, welcome, Oxford!
For we want thy help.
MONTAGUE, MONTAGUE, for Lancaster!
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
The harder match'd, the greater victory: My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Barnet presently, And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
Ah, who is nigh?
Come to me, friend or foe, And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that?
Ah, Warwick, Warwick!
Wert thou as we are.
Why, then I would not fly.
Ah, MONTAGUE, If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst, Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly, MONTAGUE, or I am dead.
Ah, Warwick!
Sweet rest his soul!
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course, And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss, But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should, if a coward heard her speak these words, Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes, Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of like spirit to himself.
If any such be here as God forbid!
Let him depart before we need his help.
Women and children of so high a courage, And warriors faint!
Why, 'twere perpetual shame.
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day, If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
So part we sadly in this troublous world, To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
What!
Can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects, And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
That you might still have worn the petticoat, And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
Sprawl'st thou?
Take that, to end thy agony.
And there's for twitting me with perjury.
O, kill me too!
Marry, and shall.
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
What, doth she swoon?
Use means for her recovery.
What?
What?
The Tower, the Tower.
O Ned, sweet Ned!
Speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak?
O traitors!
Murderers!
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself: 'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
What, wilt thou not?
Where is that devil's butcher, Hard favour'd Richard?
Richard, where art thou?
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
Where's Richard gone?
He's sudden if a thing comes in his head.
Good day, my lord.
What, at your book so hard?
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete, That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
Think'st thou I am an executioner?
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume, Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand, Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's, And many an orphan's water standing eye   Men for their sons, wives for their husbands, And orphans for their parents timeless death   Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground?
I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining, Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen; And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
To say the truth, so Judas kissed his master And cried 'all hail!  '
when as he meant all harm.
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets!
Farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
Good morrow, and well met.
How have ye done Since last we saw in France?
An untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, Met in the vale of Andren.
All the whole time I was my chamber's prisoner.
O, you go far.
As I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty, the tract of every thing Would by a good discourser lose some life, Which action's self was tongue to.
One, certes, that promises no element In such a business.
I pray you, who, my lord?
All this was order'd by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
The devil speed him!
no man's pie is freed From his ambitious finger.
What had he To do in these fierce vanities?
I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun And keep it from the earth.
Why the devil, Upon this French going out, took he upon him, Without the privity o' the king, to appoint Who should attend on him?
I do know Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have By this so sickened their estates, that never They shall abound as formerly.
O, many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey.
What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issue?
Grievingly I think, The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it.
Is it therefore The ambassador is silenced?
Marry, is't.
A proper title of a peace; and purchased At a superfluous rate!
Why, all this business Our reverend cardinal carried.
Like it your grace, The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the cardinal.
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
Where's his examination?
Here, so please you.
Is he in person ready?
Ay, please your grace.
What, are you chafed?
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only Which your disease requires.
Say not 'treasonous.  '
Faith, and so it did.
Pray, give me favour, sir.
I am sorry To hear this of him; and could wish he were Something mistaken in't.
Your office, sergeant; execute it.
Sir, My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I Arrest thee of high treason, in the name Of our most sovereign king.
Lo, you, my lord, The net has fall'n upon me!
I shall perish Under device and practise.
Nay, he must bear you company.
The king is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know How he determines further.
As the duke said, The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure By me obey'd!
Here is a warrant from The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car, One Gilbert Perk, his chancellor
A monk o' the Chartreux.
O, Nicholas Hopkins?
He.
My life itself, and the best heart of it, Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level
Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.
Thank your majesty.
That you would love yourself, and in that love Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor The dignity of your office, is the point Of my petition.
Lady mine, proceed.
Taxation!
Wherein?
and what taxation?
Please you, sir, I know but of a single part, in aught Pertains to the state; and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me.
Still exaction!
The nature of it?
in what kind, let's know, Is this exaction?
I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd Under your promised pardon.
By my life, This is against our pleasure.
A word with you.
Let there be letters writ to every shire, Of the king's grace and pardon.
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasure.
Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you, Most like a careful subject, have collected Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
Speak freely.
Please your highness, note This dangerous conception in this point.
My learn'd lord cardinal, Deliver all with charity.
He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.
What was that Hopkins?
Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor, who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty.
How know'st thou this?
Let him on.
Go forward.
On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
Ha!
what, so rank?
Ah ha!
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?
I can, my liege.
Proceed.
Being at Greenwich, After your highness had reproved the duke About Sir William Blomer,
A giant traitor!
Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom, and this man out of prison?
God mend all!
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?
There's his period, To sheathe his knife in us.
Is't possible the spells of France should juggle Men into such strange mysteries?
New customs, Though they be never so ridiculous, Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.
Death!
How now!
What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?
Faith, my lord, I hear of none, but the new proclamation That's clapp'd upon the court gate.
What is't for?
The reformation of our travell'd gallants, That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.
'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases Are grown so catching.
What a loss our ladies Will have of these trim vanities!
The devil fiddle 'em!
No, my lord; Nor shall not, while I have a stump.
Sir Thomas, Whither were you a going?
To the cardinal's: Your lordship is a guest too.
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed, A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us; His dews fall every where.
I am your lordship's.
The very thought of this fair company Clapp'd wings to me.
You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these Should find a running banquet ere they rested, I think would better please 'em: by my life, They are a sweet society of fair ones.
O, that your lordship were but now confessor To one or two of these!
I would I were; They should find easy penance.
Faith, how easy?
As easy as a down bed would afford it.
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit?
By my faith, And thank your lordship.
Was he mad, sir?
Well said, my lord.
So, now you're fairly seated.
Gentlemen, The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies Pass away frowning.
For my little cure, Let me alone.
My Lord Sands, I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.
You are a merry gamester, My Lord Sands.
Yes, if I make my play.
You cannot show me.
I told your grace they would talk anon.
What's that?
Look out there, some of ye.
What warlike voice, And to what end is this?
How now!
what is't?
You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.
A noble company!
what are their pleasures?
The fairest hand I ever touch'd!
O beauty, Till now I never knew thee!
My lord!
Your grace?
I will, my lord.
What say they?
Let me see, then.
Ye have found him, cardinal:
I am glad Your grace is grown so pleasant.
My lord chamberlain, Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?
By heaven, she is a dainty one.
Sweetheart, I were unmannerly, to take you out, And not to kiss you.
A health, gentlemen!
Let it go round.
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready I' the privy chamber?
Yes, my lord.
Your grace, I fear, with dancing is a little heated.
I fear, too much.
There's fresher air, my lord, In the next chamber.
Whither away so fast?
O, God save ye!
Even to the hall, to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
I'll save you That labour, sir.
All's now done, but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisoner.
Were you there?
Yes, indeed, was I.
Pray, speak what has happen'd.
You may guess quickly what.
Is he found guilty?
Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
I am sorry for't.
So are a number more.
But, pray, how pass'd it?
I'll tell you in a little.
The great duke Came to the bar; where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
That was he That fed him with his prophecies?
The same.
After all this, how did he bear himself?
I do not think he fears death.
Certainly The cardinal is the end of this.
That trick of state Was a deep envious one.
At his return No doubt he will requite it.
This is noted, And generally, whoever the king favours, The cardinal instantly will find employment, And far enough from court too.
Stay there, sir, And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
Let's stand close, and behold him.
All good people, You that thus far have come to pity me, Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
I do beseech your grace, for charity, If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.
To the water side I must conduct your grace; Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux, Who undertakes you to your end.
O, this is full of pity!
Sir, it calls, I fear, too many curses on their heads That were the authors.
Good angels keep it from us!
What may it be?
You do not doubt my faith, sir?
This secret is so weighty, 'twill require A strong faith to conceal it.
Let me have it; I do not talk much.
'Tis woful.
We are too open here to argue this; Let's think in private more.
'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnished.
They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north.
Well met, my lord chamberlain.
Good day to both your graces.
How is the king employ'd?
I left him private, Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
What's the cause?
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife Has crept too near his conscience.
No, his conscience Has crept too near another lady.
Pray God he do!
he'll never know himself else.
How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal!
Heaven keep me from such counsel!
And free us from his slavery.
Let's in; And with some other business put the king From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him: My lord, you'll bear us company?
Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.
How sad he looks!
sure, he is much afflicted.
Who's there, ha?
Pray God he be not angry.
Who's there, I say?
How dare you thrust yourselves Into my private meditations?
Who am I?
Who's there?
my good lord cardinal?
Sir, you cannot.
I would your grace would give us but an hour Of private conference.
We are busy; go.
This priest has no pride in him?
If it do, I'll venture one have at him.
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves, You are so noble.
To your highness' hand I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
Two equal men.
The queen shall be acquainted Forthwith for what you come.
Where's Gardiner?
I know your majesty has always loved her So dear in heart, not to deny her that A woman of less place might ask by law: Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
But to be commanded For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.
Come hither, Gardiner.
My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace In this man's place before him?
Yes, he was.
Was he not held a learned man?
Yes, surely.
Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then Even of yourself, lord cardinal.
How!
of me?
They will not stick to say you envied him, And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous, Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him, That he ran mad and died.
Heaven's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers There's places of rebuke.
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
Hearts of most hard temper Melt and lament for her.
O, God's will!
Alas, poor lady!
She's a stranger now again.
So much the more Must pity drop upon her.
Verily, I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born, And range with humble livers in content, Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief, And wear a golden sorrow.
Our content Is our best having.
By my troth and maidenhead, I would not be a queen.
Nay, good troth.
Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?
No, not for all the riches under heaven.
No, in truth.
How you do talk!
I swear again, I would not be a queen For all the world.
Good morrow, ladies.
What were't worth to know The secret of your conference?
Now, I pray God, amen!
You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings Follow such creatures.
Lady, I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit The king hath of you.
My honour'd lord.
Why, this it is; see, see!
This is strange to me.
How tastes it?
is it bitter?
forty pence, no.
There was a lady once, 'tis an old story, That would not be a queen, that would she not, For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?
Come, you are pleasant.
What do you think me?
Whilst our commission from Rome is read, Let silence be commanded.
What's the need?
It hath already publicly been read, And on all sides the authority allow'd; You may, then, spare that time.
Be't so.
Proceed.
Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.
Henry King of England, & c.
Here.
Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.
Katharine Queen of England, & c.
Lord cardinal, To you I speak.
Your pleasure, madam?
Be patient yet.
My lord, my lord, I am a simple woman, much too weak To oppose your cunning.
Call her again.
Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.
Madam, you are call'd back.
What need you note it?
Very well, my liege.
How now!
An't please your grace, the two great cardinals Wait in the presence.
Would they speak with me?
They will'd me say so, madam.
Pray their graces To come near.
What can be their business With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?
I do not like their coming.
Peace to your highness!
May it please you noble madam, to withdraw Into your private chamber, we shall give you The full cause of our coming.
Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima,
Noble lady, I am sorry my integrity should breed, And service to his majesty and you, So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
To betray me.
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears: Your hopes and friends are infinite.
I would your grace Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.
How, sir?
He tells you rightly.
Ye tell me what ye wish for both,  my ruin: Is this your Christian counsel?
out upon ye!
Your rage mistakes us.
Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye And all such false professors!
Your fears are worse.
Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty, To give up willingly that noble title Your master wed me to: nothing but death Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
Pray, hear me.
Would I had never trod this English earth, Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
What will become of me now, wretched lady!
I am the most unhappy woman living.
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
Madam, you'll find it so.
I am joyful To meet the least occasion that may give me Remembrance of my father in law, the duke, To be revenged on him.
Which of the peers Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least Strangely neglected?
when did he regard The stamp of nobleness in any person Out of himself?
Sir, I should be glad to hear such news as this
How came His practises to light?
Most strangely.
O, how, how?
Has the king this?
Believe it.
Will this work?
The king in this perceives him, how he coasts And hedges his own way.
Would he had!
May you be happy in your wish, my lord For, I profess, you have it.
Now, all my joy Trace the conjunction!
My amen to't!
All men's!
But, will the king Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
Marry, amen!
Now, God incense him, And let him cry Ha!
louder!
But, my lord, When returns Cranmer?
He is return'd in his opinions; which Have satisfied the king for his divorce, Together with all famous colleges Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe, His second marriage shall be publish'd, and Her coronation.
Katharine no more Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager And widow to Prince Arthur.
This same Cranmer's A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain In the king's business.
He has; and we shall see him For it an archbishop.
So I hear.
'Tis so.
The cardinal!
Observe, observe, he's moody.
The packet, Cromwell.
Gave't you the king?
To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?
Is he ready To come abroad?
I think, by this he is.
Leave me awhile.
He's discontented.
May be, he hears the king Does whet his anger to him.
Sharp enough, Lord, for thy justice!
The late queen's gentlewoman, a knight's daughter, To be her mistress' mistress!
the queen's queen!
This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it; Then out it goes.
What though I know her virtuous And well deserving?
He is vex'd at something.
I would 'twere something that would fret the string, The master cord on's heart!
The king, the king!
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated To his own portion!
and what expense by the hour Seems to flow from him!
How, i' the name of thrift, Does he rake this together!
Now, my lords, Saw you the cardinal?
It may well be; There is a mutiny in's mind.
Heaven forgive me!
Ever God bless your highness!
You have said well.
And ever may your highness yoke together, As I will lend you cause, my doing well With my well saying!
What should this mean?
The Lord increase this business!
Have I not made you, The prime man of the state?
What should this mean?
What sudden anger's this?
how have I reap'd it?
Stay: Where's your commission, lords?
Who dare cross 'em, Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
Till I find more than will or words to do it, I mean your malice, know, officious lords, I dare and must deny it.
The king, that gave it.
It must be himself, then.
Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
This, and all else This talking lord can lay upon my credit, I answer is most false.
All goodness Is poison to thy stomach.
How much, methinks, I could despise this man, But that I am bound in charity against it!
So much fairer And spotless shall mine innocence arise, When the king knows my truth.
I had rather want those than my head.
Have at you!
Then that, without the knowledge Either of king or council, when you went Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal.
Item, you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude, Without the king's will or the state's allowance, A league between his highness and Ferrara.
That, out of mere ambition, you have caused Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
O my lord, Press not a falling man too far!
I forgive him.
Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is, Because all those things you have done of late, By your power legatine, within this kingdom, Fall into the compass of a praemunire, That therefore such a writ be sued against you; To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements, Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be Out of the king's protection.
This is my charge.
And so we'll leave you to your meditations How to live better.
For your stubborn answer About the giving back the great seal to us, The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.
So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell!
a long farewell, to all my greatness!
Why, how now, Cromwell!
I have no power to speak, sir.
What, amazed At my misfortunes?
can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline?
Nay, an you weep, I am fall'n indeed.
How does your grace?
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the king.
God bless him!
The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord chancellor in your place.
That's somewhat sudden: But he's a learned man.
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.
That's news indeed.
There was the weight that pull'd me down.
O my lord, Must I, then, leave you?
must I needs forego So good, so noble and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron, With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
The king shall have my service: but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours.
Good sir, have patience.
So I have.
Farewell The hopes of court!
my hopes in heaven do dwell.
You're well met once again.
So are you.
You come to take your stand here, and behold The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
'Tis all my business.
At our last encounter, The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
Never greater, Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
May I be bold to ask at what that contains, That paper in your hand?
That I can tell you too.
Alas, good lady!
The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.
A royal train, believe me.
These I know: Who's that that bears the sceptre?
A bold brave gentleman.
That should be The Duke of Suffolk?
'Tis the same: high steward.
And that my Lord of Norfolk?
Yes.
Heaven bless thee!
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
They that bear The cloth of honour over her, are four barons Of the Cinque ports.
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
I take it, she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
It is; and all the rest are countesses.
Their coronets say so.
These are stars indeed; And sometimes falling ones.
No more of that.
God save you, sir!
where have you been broiling?
You saw The ceremony?
That I did.
How was it?
Well worth the seeing.
Good sir, speak it to us.
As well as I am able.
But, what follow'd?
What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the queen?
He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's, The virtuous Cranmer.
Who may that be, I pray you?
Thomas Cromwell; A man in much esteem with the king, and truly A worthy friend.
The king has made him master O' the jewel house, And one, already, of the privy council.
He will deserve more.
Yes, without all doubt.
You may command us, sir.
How does your grace?
O Griffith, sick to death!
Alas, poor man!
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him, And yet with charity.
Yes, good Griffith; I were malicious else.
After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living actions, To keep mine honour from corruption, But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me, With thy religious truth and modesty, Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!
Spirits of peace, where are ye?
are ye all gone, And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
Madam, we are here.
None, madam.
No?
Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams Possess your fancy.
Do you note How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?
How long her face is drawn?
how pale she looks, And of an earthy cold?
Mark her eyes!
She is going, wench: pray, pray.
Heaven comfort her!
An't like your grace,
You are a saucy fellow: Deserve we no more reverence?
You are to blame, Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness, To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.
I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon; My haste made me unmannerly.
There is staying A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.
Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow Let me ne'er see again.
If my sight fail not, You should be lord ambassador from the emperor, My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.
Madam, the same; your servant.
O, my lord, The times and titles now are alter'd strangely With me since first you knew me.
But, I pray you, What is your pleasure with me?
Madam, in good health.
So may he ever do!
No, madam.
Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the king.
Most willing, madam.
By heaven, I will, Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
I thank you, honest lord.
It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
It hath struck.
Came you from the king, my lord?
I must to him too, Before he go to bed.
I'll take my leave.
Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell.
What's the matter?
My lord, I love you; And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work.
The queen's in labour, They say, in great extremity; and fear'd She'll with the labour end.
Now, sir, you speak of two The most remark'd i' the kingdom.
Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.
Sir, I did never win of you before.
But little, Charles; Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.
Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
What say'st thou, ha?
To pray for her?
what, is she crying out?
Alas, good lady!
God safely quit her of her burthen, and With gentle travail, to the gladding of Your highness with an heir!
I wish your highness A quiet night; and my good mistress will Remember in my prayers.
Charles, good night.
Well, sir, what follows?
Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop, As you commanded me.
Ha!
Ay, my good lord.
'Tis true: where is he, Denny?
He attends your highness' pleasure.
This is about that which the bishop spake: I am happily come hither.
Avoid the gallery.
Ha!
I have said.
Be gone.
I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror.
All's not well.
How now, my lord!
you desire to know Wherefore I sent for you.
It is my duty To attend your highness' pleasure.
Pray you, arise, My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
Know you not How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
God and your majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into The trap is laid for me!
He has strangled His language in his tears.
Come back: what mean you?
Now, by thy looks I guess thy message.
Is the queen deliver'd?
Say, ay; and of a boy.
Lovell!
Sir?
Give her an hundred marks.
I'll to the queen.
An hundred marks!
By this light, I'll ha' more.
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
I will have more, or scold it out of him.
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
Yes, my lord; But yet I cannot help you.
Why?
Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.
So.
This is a piece of malice.
I'll show your grace the strangest sight
What's that, Butts?
I think your highness saw this many a day.
Body o' me, where is it?
Ha!
Speak to the business, master secretary: Why are we met in council?
Please your honours, The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.
Has he had knowledge of it?
Yes.
Who waits there?
Without, my noble lords?
Yes.
Let him come in.
Your grace may enter now.
My lord, because we have business of more moment, We will be short with you.
Why, my lord?
Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect?
ye are not sound.
Not sound?
Not sound, I say.
Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.
I shall remember this bold language.
Do.
Remember your bold life too.
This is too much; Forbear, for shame, my lords.
I have done.
And I.
We are.
What other Would you expect?
you are strangely troublesome.
For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?
Receive him, And see him safe i' the Tower.
Stay, good my lords, I have a little yet to say.
This is the king's ring.
'Tis no counterfeit.
Do you think, my lords, The king will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex'd?
My mind gave me, In seeking tales and informations Against this man, whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at, Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!
You were ever good at sudden commendations, Bishop of Winchester.
May it please your grace,
No, sir, it does not please me.
I had thought I had had men of some understanding And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man, This good man,  few of you deserve that title,   This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy At chamber  door?
and one as great as you are?
Why, what a shame was this!
Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves?
Thus far, My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace To let my tongue excuse all.
What was purposed Concerning his imprisonment, was rather, If there be faith in men, meant for his trial, And fair purgation to the world, than malice, I'm sure, in me.
With a true heart And brother love I do it.
And let heaven Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.
Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue!
is this a place to roar in?
How got they in, and be hang'd?
Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
You did nothing, sir.
I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.
Keep the door close, sirrah.
What would you have me do?
What should you do, but knock 'em down by the dozens?
Is this Moorfields to muster in?
or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us?
Bless me, what a fry of fornication is at door!
On my Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a
The spoons will be the bigger, sir.
Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
Make way there for the princess.
You great fellow, Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.
You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail; I'll peck you o'er the pales else.
Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty princess of England, Elizabeth!
And to your royal grace, and the good queen, My noble partners, and myself, thus pray: All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady, Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy, May hourly fall upon ye!
Thank you, good lord archbishop: What is her name?
Elizabeth.
Stand up, lord.
With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
Into whose hand I give thy life.
Amen.
Thou speakest wonders.
O lord archbishop, Thou hast made me now a man!
Hence!
Home, you idle creatures get you home!
Is this a holiday?
Why, sir, a carpenter.
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
But what trade art thou?
Answer me directly.
What trade, thou knave?
Thou naughty knave, what trade?
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.
Yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
What mean’st thou by that?
“Mend” me, thou saucy fellow?
Why, sir, cobble you.
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl.
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work.
But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
Wherefore rejoice?
What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
See whether their basest metal be not moved.
They vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.
This way will I.   Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies.
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
It is no matter.
Let no images Be hung with Caesar’s trophies.
Calphurnia!
Peace, ho!
Caesar speaks.
Calphurnia!
Here, my lord.
Stand you directly in Antonius' way When he doth run his course.
Antonius!
Caesar, my lord.
I shall remember.
When Caesar says, “do this,” it is performed.
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
Caesar!
Ha!
Who calls?
Bid every noise be still.
Peace yet again.
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, Cry “Caesar!
”  Speak.
Caesar is turned to hear.
Beware the ides of March.
What man is that?
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Set him before me.
Let me see his face.
Fellow, come from the throng.
Look upon Caesar.
What sayst thou to me now?
Speak once again.
Beware the ides of March.
He is a dreamer.
Let us leave him.
Pass!
Will you go see the order of the course?
Not I.
I pray you, do.
I am not gamesome.
I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
I’ll leave you.
Cassius, Be not deceived.
If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself.
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things.
'Tis just.
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.
And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.
What means this shouting?
I do fear, the people Choose Caesar for their king.
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
I would not, Cassius.
Yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter.
For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved.
What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
I will do so.
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Antonio.
Caesar.
Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek headed men and such as sleep a nights.
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much.
Such men are dangerous.
Fear him not, Caesar.
He’s not dangerous.
He is a noble Roman and well given.
Would he were fatter!
But I fear him not.
Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius.
He reads much.
He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men.
He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony .
He hears no music.
You pulled me by the cloak.
Would you speak with me?
Ay, Casca.
Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad.
Why, you were with him, were you not?
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a shouting.
What was the second noise for?
Why, for that too.
They shouted thrice.
What was the last cry for?
Why, for that too.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
Who offered him the crown?
Why, Antony.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
It was mere foolery.
I did not mark it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown    and, as I told you, he put it by once but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it .
But soft, I pray you.
What, did Caesar swoon?
He fell down in the marketplace, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.
'Tis very like.
He hath the falling sickness.
No, Caesar hath it not.
But you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
What said he when he came unto himself?
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut.
And after that he came thus sad away?
Ay.
Did Cicero say anything?
Ay, he spoke Greek.
To what effect?
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
No, I am promised forth.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating.
Good.
I will expect you.
Do so.
Farewell both.
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form.
And so it is.
For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you.
Or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
I will do so.
Till then, think of the world.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble.
Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed.
Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes, For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me.
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at.
Good even, Casca.
Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless?
And why stare you so?
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm?
Indeed, it is a strange disposèd time.
But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
Good night then, Casca.
This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in.
Farewell, Cicero.
Who’s there?
A Roman.
Casca, by your voice.
Your ear is good.
Cassius, what night is this!
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And, thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder stone.
And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send
'Tis Caesar that you mean.
Is it not, Cassius?
Let it be who it is.
For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors, But woe the while!
I know where I will wear this dagger then.
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong.
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws.
You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale.
Hold, my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
There’s a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable dangerous consequence.
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
'Tis Cinna.
I do know him by his gait.
He is a friend.
Cinna, where haste you so?
To find out you.
Who’s that?
Metellus Cimber?
No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts.
Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
I am glad on ’t.
What a fearful night is this!
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Am I not stayed for?
Tell me.
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party
Be you content.
Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it.
And throw this In at his window.
Set this up with wax Upon old Brutus' statue.
All this done, Repair to Pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house.
Well, I will hie, And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to day .
Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when?
Awake, I say!
What, Lucius!
Called you, my lord?
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
I will, my lord.
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Get you to bed again.
It is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
I know not, sir.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
I will, sir.
The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them.
“Brutus, thou sleep’st.
Awake, and see thyself.
Shall Rome, etc.
Speak, strike, redress!
” “Brutus, thou sleep’st.
Awake.
” Such instigations have been often dropped Where I have took them up.
“Shall Rome, etc.
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
'Tis good.
Go to the gate.
Somebody knocks.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.
Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you.
Is he alone?
No, sir, there are more with him.
Do you know them?
No, sir.
Their hats are plucked about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor.
Let 'em enter.
They are the faction.
O conspiracy, Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free?
O, then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?
Seek none, conspiracy.
Hide it in smiles and affability.
For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus.
Do we trouble you?
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?
He is welcome hither.
This, Decius Brutus.
He is welcome too.
This, Casca.
This, Cinna.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?
Shall I entreat a word?
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?
No.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the south, Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
And let us swear our resolution.
No, not an oath.
But what of Cicero?
Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
Let us not leave him out.
No, by no means.
O, name him not.
Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin.
Then leave him out.
Indeed he is not fit.
Shall no man else be touched but only Caesar?
Decius, well urged.
I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar.
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver.
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards, For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness and much company.
There is no fear in him.
Peace!
Count the clock.
The clock hath stricken three.
'Tis time to part.
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no.
For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies.
It may be, these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
By the eighth hour.
Is that the uttermost?
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.
Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him.
The morning comes upon ’s.
We’ll leave you, Brutus.
And, friends, disperse yourselves.
But all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.
Boy!
Lucius!
Fast asleep?
It is no matter.
Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber.
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, Which busy care draws in the brains of men.
Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.
Brutus, my lord.
Portia, what mean you?
Wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.
Nor for yours neither.
Y' have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed.
I am not well in health, and that is all.
Why, so I do.
Good Portia, go to bed.
Is Brutus sick?
And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning?
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
I should not need if you were gentle, Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you?
Am I yourself But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes?
Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure?
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Hark, hark!
One knocks.
Lucius, who’s that knocking?
He is a sick man that would speak with you.
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside.
Caius Ligarius, how?
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, To wear a kerchief!
Would you were not sick!
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
By all the gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my sickness!
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
That must we also.
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done.
Set on your foot, And with a heart new fired I follow you, To do I know not what.
Follow me, then.
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out, “Help, ho!
They murder Caesar!
”  Who’s within?
My lord.
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success.
I will, my lord.
What mean you, Caesar?
Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.
Caesar shall forth.
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back.
When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.
There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
When beggars die there are no comets seen.
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
The valiant never taste of death but once.
What say the augurers?
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast.
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not.
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today.
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, And he shall say you are not well today.
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
He shall tell them so.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.
I come to fetch you to the senate house.
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.
Say he is sick.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
The cause is in my will.
I will not come.
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know.
Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood.
And many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
This dream is all amiss interpreted.
It was a vision fair and fortunate.
And this way have you well expounded it.
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
I am ashamèd I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
And look, where Publius is come to fetch me.
Good morrow, Caesar.
Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?
Good morrow, Casca.
Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
See, Antony, that revels long a nights, Is notwithstanding up.
Good morrow, Antony.
So to most noble Caesar.
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna.
Now, Metellus.
What, Trebonius, I have an hour’s talk in store for you.
Remember that you call on me today.
Be near me, that I may remember you.
Caesar, I will.
And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me.
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
That every “like” is not the same, O Caesar, The heart of Brutus earns to think upon.
“Caesar, beware of Brutus.
Take heed of Cassius.
Come not near Casca.
Have an eye to Cinna.
Trust not Trebonius.
Mark well Metellus Cimber.
Decius Brutus loves thee not.
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.
If thou beest not immortal, look about you.
Security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend thee!
I prithee, boy, run to the senate house.
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?
To know my errand, madam.
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side, Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man’s mind but a woman’s might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, For he went sickly forth.
And take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy!
What noise is that?
I hear none, madam.
Prithee, listen well.
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
Come hither, fellow.
Which way hast thou been?
At mine own house, good lady.
What is ’t o'clock?
About the ninth hour, lady.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Madam, not yet.
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?
None that I know will be; much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you.
Here the street is narrow.
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
I must go in.
Ay me, how weak a thing The heart of woman is!
O Brutus, The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure, the boy heard me.
Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant.
Oh, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord.
Say I am merry.
Come to me again, And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
The ides of March are come.
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
Hail, Caesar!
Read this schedule.
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read, At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer.
Read it, great Caesar.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
Delay not, Caesar.
Read it instantly.
What, is the fellow mad?
Sirrah, give place.
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
What enterprise, Popillius?
Fare you well.
What said Popillius Lena?
He wished today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discoverèd.
Look how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention  Brutus, what shall be done?
Cassius, be constant.
Popillius Lena speaks not of our purposes.
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
Trebonius knows his time.
For, look you, Brutus.
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
He is addressed.
Press near and second him.
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
Are we all ready?
What is now amiss That Caesar and his senate must redress?
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children.
Be not fond, To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools  I mean, sweet words, Low crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banishèd.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother?
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
What, Brutus?
Pardon, Caesar.
Caesar, pardon.
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
I could be well moved if I were as you.
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me.
But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks.
O Caesar
Hence!
Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
Great Caesar
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Speak, hands, for me!
Et tu, Bruté?
Then fall, Caesar.
Liberty!
Freedom!
Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
People and senators, be not affrighted.
Fly not.
Stand still.
Ambition’s debt is paid.
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
And Cassius too.
Where’s Publius?
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance
Talk not of standing.
Publius, good cheer.
There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.
So tell them, Publius.
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
Do so.
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers.
Where is Antony?
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday.
Fates, we will know your pleasures.
That we shall die, we know.
'Tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
Grant that, and then is death a benefit.
So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death.
Stoop, then, and wash.
How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust!
So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called “The men that gave their country liberty.
What, shall we forth?
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Soft!
Who comes here?
A friend of Antony’s.
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched.
I’ll fetch him presently.
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
I wish we may.
But yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
But here comes Antony.
Welcome, Mark Antony.
O mighty Caesar!
Dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure?
Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.
O Antony, beg not your death of us.
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel  As by our hands and this our present act You see we do  yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done.
Our hearts you see not.
They are pitiful.
Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities.
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.
Now, Decius Brutus, yours.
Now yours, Metellus.
Yours, Cinna.
And, my valiant Casca, yours.
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all, alas, what shall I say?
Mark Antony
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
I blame you not for praising Caesar so.
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all
Or else were this a savage spectacle!
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.
You shall, Mark Antony.
Brutus, a word with you .
You know not what you do.
Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral.
Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter?
I know not what may fall.
I like it not.
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do ’t by our permission.
Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral.
Be it so.
I do desire no more.
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy  Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue  A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy.
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
I do, Mark Antony.
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
He did receive his letters and is coming.
And bid me say to you by word of mouth   O Caesar!
Thy heart is big.
Get thee apart and weep.
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.
Hie hence, and tell him so.
Yet, stay awhile.
We will be satisfied!
Let us be satisfied!
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here.
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him, And public reasons shall be renderèd
I will hear Brutus speak.
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd.
The noble Brutus is ascended.
Silence!
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!
Hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear.
Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe.
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men?
None, Brutus, none.
Then none have I offended.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol.
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.
Live, Brutus!
Live, live!
Bring him with triumph home unto his house!
Give him a statue with his ancestors!
Let him be Caesar!
Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus!
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
My countrymen
Peace, silence!
Brutus speaks.
Peace, ho!
Good countrymen, let me depart alone.
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony By our permission is allowed to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Stay, ho!
And let us hear Mark Antony.
Let him go up into the public chair.
We’ll hear him.
Noble Antony, go up.
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
What does he say of Brutus?
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all.
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Nay, that’s certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Peace!
Let us hear what Antony can say.
You gentle Romans
Peace, ho!
Let us hear him.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Marked ye his words?
He would not take the crown.
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Poor soul!
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Now mark him.
He begins again to speak.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.
Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong  Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong.
I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
We’ll hear the will.
Read it, Mark Antony!
The will, the will!
We will hear Caesar’s will.
Have patience, gentle friends.
I must not read it.
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.
Read the will.
We’ll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Will you be patient?
Will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
I do fear it.
They were traitors!
“Honorable men”!
The will!
The testament!
They were villains, murderers.
The will!
Read the will!
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend?
And will you give me leave?
Come down.
Descend.
You shall have leave.
A ring!
Stand round.
Stand from the hearse.
Stand from the body.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony!
Nay, press not so upon me.
Stand far off.
Stand back.
Room!
Bear back.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle.
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on.
'Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.
Through this the well belovèd Brutus stabbed.
And as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors, to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all.
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquished him.
O piteous spectacle!
O noble Caesar!
O woeful day!
O traitors, villains!
O most bloody sight!
We will be revenged.
Revenge!
About!
Seek!
Burn!
Fire!
Kill!
Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
Stay, countrymen.
Peace there!
Hear the noble Antony.
We’ll hear him.
We’ll follow him.
We’ll die with him.
We’ll mutiny.
We’ll burn the house of Brutus.
Away, then!
Come, seek the conspirators.
Yet hear me, countrymen.
Peace, ho!
Hear Antony.
Most noble Antony!
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not.
I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.
Most true.
The will!
Let’s stay and hear the will.
Most noble Caesar!
We’ll revenge his death.
O royal Caesar!
Hear me with patience.
Peace, ho!
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors and new planted orchards, On this side Tiber.
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever common pleasures, To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar!
When comes such another?
Never, never.
Come, away, away!
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
Go fetch fire.
Pluck down benches.
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
Now let it work.
Mischief, thou art afoot.
Take thou what course thou wilt!
How now, fellow?
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
And thither will I straight to visit him.
He comes upon a wish.
Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything.
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them.
Bring me to Octavius.
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unlucky charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth.
What is your name?
Whither are you going?
Where do you dwell?
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Answer every man directly.
Ay, and briefly.
Ay, and wisely.
Ay, and truly, you were best.
What is my name?
Whither am I going?
Where do I dwell?
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.
You’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear.
Proceed, directly.
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.
As a friend or an enemy?
As a friend.
That matter is answered directly.
For your dwelling briefly.
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
Your name, sir, truly.
Truly, my name is Cinna.
Tear him to pieces.
He’s a conspirator.
I am Cinna the poet.
I am Cinna the poet.
Tear him for his bad verses!
Tear him for his bad verses!
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
It is no matter.
His name’s Cinna.
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going.
Tear him, tear him!
These many, then, shall die.
Their names are pricked.
Your brother too must die.
Consent you, Lepidus?
I do consent
Prick him down, Antony.
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.
He shall not live.
Look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house.
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies.
What, shall I find you here?
Or here, or at the Capitol.
This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands.
So you thought him.
And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription.
Octavius, I have seen more days than you.
You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender.
Stand, ho!
Give the word, ho, and stand.
What now, Lucillius?
Is Cassius near?
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master.
He greets me well.
I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
He is not doubted.
A word, Lucillius.
How he received you, let me be resolved.
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.
Ever note, Lucillius, When love begins to sicken and decay, It useth an enforcèd ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.
But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.
Comes his army on?
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.
The greater part, the horse in general, Are come with Cassius.
Hark!
He is arrived.
March gently on to meet him.
Stand, ho!
Stand, ho!
Speak the word along.
Stand!
Stand!
Stand!
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Judge me, you gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs.
And when you do them
Cassius, be content.
Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground.
Lucillius, do you the like.
And let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.
I “an itching palm!
” You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Chastisement!
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
Brutus, bait not me.
I’ll not endure it.
You forget yourself To hedge me in.
I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions.
Go to.
You are not, Cassius.
I am.
I say you are not.
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
Away, slight man!
Is ’t possible?
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?
“All this?” Ay, more.
Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble.
Must I budge?
Must I observe you?
Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor?
Is it come to this?
You say you are a better soldier.
Let it appear so.
Make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well.
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
You wrong me every way.
You wrong me, Brutus.
I said an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say “better?”
If you did, I care not.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.
I durst not!
No.
What, durst not tempt him?
For your life you durst not!
Do not presume too much upon my love.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.
I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means.
I denied you not.
You did.
I did not.
He was but a fool that brought My answer back.
Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
I do not, till you practice them on me.
You love me not.
I do not like your faults.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus.
Sheathe your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, When grief and blood ill tempered vexeth him?
When I spoke that, I was ill tempered too.
Do you confess so much?
Give me your hand.
And my heart too.
O Brutus!
What’s the matter?
Yes, Cassius.
And from henceforth When you are over earnest with your Brutus, He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.
Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em.
'Tis not meet They be alone.
You shall not come to them.
Nothing but death shall stay me.
How now?
What’s the matter?
For shame, you generals!
What do you mean?
Love, and be friends as two such men should be.
For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.
Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
Get you hence, sirrah.
Saucy fellow, hence!
Bear with him, Brutus.
'Tis his fashion.
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!
Away, away, be gone.
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you, Immediately to us.
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
I did not think you could have been so angry.
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils.
No man bears sorrow better.
Portia is dead.
Ha, Portia?
She is dead.
How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
And died so?
Even so.
O ye immortal gods!
Speak no more of her.
Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
Come in, Titinius.
Welcome, good Messala!
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.
Portia, art thou gone?
No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
With what addition?
Therein our letters do not well agree.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
Cicero one?
Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
No, Messala.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
Nothing, Messala.
That methinks is strange.
Why ask you?
Hear you aught of her in yours?
No, my lord.
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell.
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
Why, farewell, Portia.
We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.
Even so great men great losses should endure.
I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.
Well, to our work alive.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
I do not think it good.
Your reason?
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution.
Hear me, good brother
Under your pardon.
You must note beside, That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe.
The enemy increaseth every day.
Then, with your will, go on.
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
No more.
Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
Lucius!
My gown.
Farewell, good Messala.
Good night, Titinius.
Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose.
Everything is well.
Good night, my lord.
Good night, good brother.
Farewell, everyone.
Give me the gown.
Where is thy instrument?
Here in the tent.
What, thou speak’st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not.
Thou art o'erwatched.
Call Claudio and some other of my men.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Varrus and Claudio!
Calls my lord?
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
I will not have it so.
Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so.
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.
It does, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
It is my duty, sir.
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
I have slept, my lord, already.
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.
I will not hold thee long.
If I do live, I will be good to thee.
This is a sleepy tune.
O murderous slumber, Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music?
Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
How ill this taper burns!
Ha, who comes here?
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
Why comest thou?
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well, then I shall see thee again?
Ay, at Philippi.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy, Lucius!
Varrus!
Claudio!
Sirs, awake!
Claudio!
The strings, my lord, are false.
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake.
My lord?
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see any thing?
Nothing, my lord.
Sleep again, Lucius.
Sirrah Claudio!
Fellow thou, awake!
My lord?
My lord?
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
Ay.
Saw you anything?
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
Nor I, my lord.
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.
Bid him set on his powers betimes before, And we will follow.
Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so.
Their battles are at hand.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it.
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show.
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.
Upon the right hand I.
Keep thou the left.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
I do not cross you.
But I will do so.
They stand and would have parley.
Stand fast, Titinius.
We must out and talk.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth.
The generals would have some words.
Stir not until the signal.
Words before blows.
Is it so, countrymen?
Not that we love words better, as you do.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart, Crying “Long live, hail, Caesar!
”
Antony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown.
Not stingless too?
Oh, yes, and soundless too.
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting.
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.
Flatterers?
Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled.
Come, come, the cause.
If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look, I draw a sword against conspirators.
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
So I hope.
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler!
Old Cassius still.
Come, Antony, away.
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field.
If not, when you have stomachs.
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up and all is on the hazard.
Ho, Lucillius, hark, a word with you.
My lord?
Messala!
What says my general?
Believe not so.
I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.
Even so, Lucillius.
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you then determinèd to do?
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?
No, Cassius, no.
Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.
He bears too great a mind.
But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun.
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.
If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.
If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.
Why then, lead on.
Oh, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.
Come, ho!
Away!
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.
This ensign here of mine was turning back.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
This hill is far enough.
Look, look, Titinius.
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
They are, my lord.
I will be here again, even with a thought.
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.
My sight was ever thick.
Regard Titinius, And tell me what thou notest about the field.
This day I breathed first.
Time is come round, And where I did begin, there shall I end.
My life is run his compass.
Sirrah, what news?
O my lord!
What news?
Titinius is enclosèd round about With horsemen, that make to him on the spur.
Yet he spurs on.
Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius.
Now some light.
Oh, he lights too.
He’s ta'en.
And, hark!
They shout for joy.
Come down, behold no more.
Come hither, sirrah.
Caesar, thou art revenged, Even with the sword that killed thee.
So I am free.
Yet would not so have been, Durst I have done my will.
O Cassius, Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
Where did you leave him?
All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman on this hill.
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
He lies not like the living.
O my heart!
Is not that he?
No, this was he, Messala, But Cassius is no more.
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy’s child, Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not?
O error, soon conceived, Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill’st the mother that engendered thee!
What, Pindarus!
Where art thou, Pindarus?
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears.
I may say “thrusting” it, For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.
Hie you, Messala, And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends?
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee?
Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding.
Brutus, come apace, And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
By your leave, gods, this is a Roman’s part.
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
Titinius' face is upward.
He is slain.
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.
Brave Titinius!
Look whe 'er he have not crowned dead Cassius.
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow.
Friends, I owe more tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.
His funerals shall not be in our camp, Lest it discomfort us.
Lucillius, come.
And come, young Cato.
Let us to the field.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
What bastard doth not?
Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!
Brutus, my country’s friend.
Know me for Brutus!
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius, And mayst be honored, being Cato’s son.
Yield, or thou diest.
Only I yield to die.
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
We must not.
A noble prisoner!
Room, ho!
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.
I’ll tell the news.
Here comes the general.
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
Where is he?
Safe, Antony.
Brutus is safe enough.
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.
He is or ta'en or slain.
Sit thee down, Clitus.
Slaying is the word.
It is a deed in fashion.
Hark thee, Clitus.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
Peace then!
No words.
I’ll rather kill myself.
Hark thee, Dardanius.
Shall I do such a deed?
O Dardanius!
O Clitus!
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
To kill him, Clitus.
Look, he meditates.
Now is that noble vessel full of grief, That it runs over even at his eyes.
Come hither, good Volumnius.
List a word.
What says my lord?
Not so, my lord.
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us.
Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together.
Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts, whilst I run on it.
That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.
Fly, fly, my lord.
There is no tarrying here.
Farewell to you.
And you .
And you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.
Farewell to thee too, Strato.
Countrymen, My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history.
Night hangs upon mine eyes.
My bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour.
Fly, my lord, fly.
Hence.
I will follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it.
Wilt thou, Strato?
Give me your hand first.
Fare you well, my lord.
Farewell, good Strato.
Caesar, now be still.
I killed not thee with half so good a will.
What man is that?
My master’s man.
Strato, where is thy master?
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
So Brutus should be found.
I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast proved Lucillius' saying true.
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
Do so, good Messala.
How died my master, Strato?
I held the sword and he did run on it.
Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, “This was a man.
”
According to his virtue let us use him, With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France In my behavior to the majesty, The borrow'd majesty, of England here.
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!  '
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
What follows if we disallow of this?
The proud control of fierce and bloody war, To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
Here have we war for war and blood for blood, Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth, The farthest limit of my embassy.
What now, my son!
have I not ever said How that ambitious Constance would not cease Till she had kindled France and all the world,
Our strong possession and our right for us.
My liege, here is the strangest controversy Come from country to be judged by you, That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
Let them approach.
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay This expedition's charge.
What men are you?
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son, As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge, A soldier, by the honour giving hand Of Coeur de lion knighted in the field.
What art thou?
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.
Out on thee, rude man!
thou dost shame thy mother And wound her honour with this diffidence.
I, madam?
A good blunt fellow.
Why, being younger born, Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
I know not why, except to get the land.
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
Mine eye hath well examined his parts And finds them perfect Richard.
Sirrah, speak, What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
Because he hath a half face, like my father.
My gracious liege, when that my father lived, Your brother did employ my father much,
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy To Germany, there with the emperor To treat of high affairs touching that time.
Shall then my father's will be of no force To dispossess that child which is not his?
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir, Than was his will to get me, as I think.
Madam, an if my brother had my shape, And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him; And if my legs were two such riding rods, My arms such eel skins stuff'd, my face so thin That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose Lest men should say 'Look, where three farthings goes!  '
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year, Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
Our country manners give our betters way.
What is thy name?
Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand: My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day, When I was got, sir Robert was away!
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
A foot of honour better than I was; But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
'Good den, sir Richard!  '
'God a mercy, fellow!  '
O me!
it is my mother.
How now, good lady!
What brings you here to court so hastily?
Where is that slave, thy brother?
My brother Robert?
old sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
Sir Robert's son!
Ay, thou unreverend boy, Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
Good leave, good Philip.
Philip!
sparrow: James, There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too, That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco like.
What!
I am dubb'd!
I have it on my shoulder.
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
Now, by this light, were I to get again, Madam, I would not wish a better father.
A noble boy!
Who would not do thee right?
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks, Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength To make a more requital to your love!
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords In such a just and charitable war.
A wonder, lady!
lo, upon thy wish, Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord; We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege And stir them up against a mightier task.
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
Peace be to England, if that war return From France to England, there to live in peace.
From whom hast thou this great commission, France, To draw my answer from thy articles?
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
Let me make answer; thy usurping son.
Out, insolent!
thy bastard shall be king, That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
Peace!
Hear the crier.
What the devil art thou?
O, well did he become that lion's robe That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
What craker is this same that deafs our ears With this abundance of superfluous breath?
Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
Women and fools, break off your conference.
My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.
Come to thy grandam, child.
Good my mother, peace!
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
Bedlam, have done.
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce A will that bars the title of thy son.
Ay, who doubts that?
a will!
a wicked will: A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!
Peace, lady!
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
England, for itself.
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects, Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
When I have said, make answer to us both.
Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses, Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,
Bastards, and else.
To verify our title with their lives.
As many and as well born bloods as those,
Some bastards too.
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
Till you compound whose right is worthiest, We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls That to their everlasting residence, Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet, In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
Amen, amen!
Mount, chevaliers!
to arms!
Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door, Teach us some fence!
Sirrah, were I at home, At your den, sirrah, with your lioness I would set an ox head to your lion's hide, And make a monster of you.
Peace!
no more.
O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Say, shall the current of our right run on?
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment, Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell With course disturb'd even thy confining shores, Unless thou let his silver water keep A peaceful progress to the ocean.
England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood, In this hot trial, more than we of France; Rather, lost more.
Ha, majesty!
how high thy glory towers, When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
The king of England; when we know the king.
Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
In us, that are our own great deputy And bear possession of our person here, Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads, I like it well.
France, shall we knit our powers And lay this Angiers even to the ground; Then after fight who shall be king of it?
Let it be so.
Say, where will you assault?
We from the west will send destruction Into this city's bosom.
I from the north.
Our thunder from the south Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
O prudent discipline!
From north to south: Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth: I'll stir them to it.
Come, away, away!
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
Here's a stay That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death Out of his rags!
Here's a large mouth, indeed, That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas, Talks as familiarly of roaring lions As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs!
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
Why answer not the double majesties This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
Speak England first, that hath been forward first To speak unto this city: what say you?
What say'st thou, boy?
look in the lady's face.
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
And quarter'd in her heart!
What say these young ones?
What say you my niece?
That she is bound in honour still to do What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love; For I do love her most unfeignedly.
It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
And your lips too; for I am well assured That I did so when I was first assured.
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
Mad world!
mad kings!
mad composition!
Gone to be married!
gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood join'd!
gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
As true as I believe you think them false That give you cause to prove my saying true.
O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow, Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die, And let belief and life encounter so As doth the fury of two desperate men Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Lewis marry Blanch!
O boy, then where art thou?
France friend with England, what becomes of me?
What other harm have I, good lady, done, But spoke the harm that is by others done?
Which harm within itself so heinous is As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
I do beseech you, madam, be content.
Pardon me, madam, I may not go without you to the kings.
A wicked day, and not a holy day!
What hath this day deserved?
what hath it done, That it in golden letters should be set Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week, This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
Lady Constance, peace!
War!
war!
no peace!
peace is to me a war O Lymoges!
O Austria!
O, that a man should speak those words to me!
And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs.
Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.
And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs.
We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
What earthy name to interrogatories Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name So slight, unworthy and ridiculous, To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
Though you and all the kings of Christendom Are led so grossly by this meddling priest, Dreading the curse that money may buy out; And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust, Purchase corrupted pardon of a man, Who in that sale sells pardon from himself, Though you and all the rest so grossly led This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish, Yet I alone, alone do me oppose Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
Then, by the lawful power that I have, Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
O, lawful let it be That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
Philip of France, on peril of a curse, Let go the hand of that arch heretic; And raise the power of France upon his head, Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
Look'st thou pale, France?
do not let go thy hand.
King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
And hang a calf's skin on his recreant limbs.
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because
Your breeches best may carry them.
Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
What should he say, but as the cardinal?
That's the curse of Rome.
O Lewis, stand fast!
the devil tempts thee here In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith, But from her need.
O, if thou grant my need, Which only lives but by the death of faith, That need must needs infer this principle, That faith would live again by death of need.
The king is moved, and answers not to this.
O, be removed from him, and answer well!
Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
Hang nothing but a calf's skin, most sweet lout.
I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more, If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
Good reverend father, make my person yours, And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
All form is formless, order orderless, Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore to arms!
be champion of our church, Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse, A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue, A chafed lion by the mortal paw, A fasting tiger safer by the tooth, Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith; And like a civil war set'st oath to oath, Thy tongue against thy tongue.
O, let thy vow First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd, That is, to be the champion of our church!
Rebellion, flat rebellion!
Will't not be?
Will not a calfs skin stop that mouth of thine?
Father, to arms!
Upon thy wedding day?
Against the blood that thou hast married?
What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums, Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
O husband, hear me!
ay, alack, how new Is husband in my mouth!
even for that name, Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce, Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms Against mine uncle.
O, upon my knee, Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee, Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom Forethought by heaven!
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds, His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold, When such profound respects do pull you on.
I will denounce a curse upon his head.
Thou shalt not need.
England, I will fall from thee.
O fair return of banish'd majesty!
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
Old Time the clock setter, that bald sexton Time, Is it as he will?
well then, France shall rue.
The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
Which is the side that I must go withal?
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
No more than he that threats.
To arms let's hie!
Hubert, keep this boy.
O, this will make my mother die with grief!
Cousin, away for England!
Farewell, gentle cousin.
Coz, farewell.
Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
Come hither, Hubert.
O my gentle Hubert, We owe thee much!
I am much bounden to your majesty.
So well, that what you bid me undertake, Though that my death were adjunct to my act, By heaven, I would do it.
Do not I know thou wouldst?
And I'll keep him so, That he shall not offend your majesty.
Death.
My lord?
A grave.
He shall not live.
Enough.
I could be merry now.
My blessing go with thee!
So, by a roaring tempest on the flood, A whole armado of convicted sail Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.
Courage and comfort!
all shall yet go well.
What can go well, when we have run so ill?
Are we not beaten?
Is not Angiers lost?
Arthur ta'en prisoner?
divers dear friends slain?
And bloody England into England gone, O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
Well could I bear that England had this praise, So we could find some pattern of our shame.
Look, who comes here!
a grave unto a soul; Holding the eternal spirit against her will, In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
I prithee, lady, go away with me.
Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.
Patience, good lady!
comfort, gentle Constance!
No, I defy all counsel, all redress, But that which ends all counsel, true redress, Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
Thou odouriferous stench!
sound rottenness!
O fair affliction, peace!
Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
Bind up those tresses.
O, what love I note In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen, Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends Do glue themselves in sociable grief, Like true, inseparable, faithful loves, Sticking together in calamity.
To England, if you will.
Bind up your hairs.
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
He talks to me that never had a son.
You are as fond of grief as of your child.
I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
All days of glory, joy and happiness.
If you had won it, certainly you had.
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit; For even the breath of what I mean to speak Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub, Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins, The misplaced John should entertain an hour, One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life, But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
Uncleanly scruples!
fear not you: look to't.
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
Good morrow, Hubert.
Good morrow, little prince.
Indeed, I have been merrier.
Mercy on me!
If I talk to him, with his innocent prate He will awake my mercy which lies dead: Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
Are you sick, Hubert?
His words do take possession of my bosom.
Read here, young Arthur.
How now, foolish rheum!
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
Young boy, I must.
And will you?
And I will.
Have you the heart?
I have sworn to do it; And with hot irons must I burn them out.
Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
Come forth.
Do as I bid you do.
O, save me, Hubert, save me!
my eyes are out Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
Alas, what need you be so boisterous rough?
I will not struggle, I will stand stone still.
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
Come, boy, prepare yourself.
Is there no remedy?
None, but to lose your eyes.
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours, A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair, Any annoyance in that precious sense!
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there, Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
Is this your promise?
go to, hold your tongue.
I can heat it, boy.
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
O, now you look like Hubert!
all this while You were disguised.
Peace; no more.
Adieu.
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
O heaven!
I thank you, Hubert.
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd, And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp, To guard a title that was rich before, To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, To throw a perfume on the violet, To smooth the ice, or add another hue Unto the rainbow, or with taper light To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
To this effect, before you were new crown'd, We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
Let it be so: I do commit his youth To your direction.
Hubert, what news with you?
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame That greatness should so grossly offer it: So thrive it in your game!
and so, farewell.
They burn in indignation.
From France to England.
Never such a power For any foreign preparation Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them; For when you should be told they do prepare, The tidings come that they are all arrived.
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept?
Where is my mother's care, That such an army could be drawn in France, And she not hear of it?
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased My discontented peers!
What!
mother dead!
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
Under the Dauphin.
Thou hast made me giddy With these ill tidings.
Now, what says the world To your proceedings?
do not seek to stuff My head with more ill news, for it is full.
But if you be afeard to hear the worst, Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
How I have sped among the clergymen, The sums I have collected shall express.
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
O my gentle cousin, Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
I will seek them out.
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies, When adverse foreigners affright my towns With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels, And fly like thought from them to me again.
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need Some messenger betwixt me and the peers; And be thou he.
With all my heart, my liege.
My mother dead!
Five moons!
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
No had, my lord!
why, did you not provoke me?
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
My lord
Arm you against your other enemies, I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Doth Arthur live?
O, haste thee to the peers, Throw this report on their incensed rage, And make them tame to their obedience!
O me!
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France, Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love Is much more general than these lines import.
To morrow morning let us meet him then.
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
Once more to day well met, distemper'd lords!
The king by me requests your presence straight.
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
But there is little reason in your grief; Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
This is the prison.
What is he lies here?
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
Murder, as hating what himself hath done, Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave, Found it too precious princely for a grave.
Sir Richard, what think you?
It is a damned and a bloody work; The graceless action of a heavy hand, If that it be the work of any hand.
If that it be the work of any hand!
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
O, he is old and blushes not at death.
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
I am no villain.
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
Out, dunghill!
darest thou brave a nobleman?
Thou art a murderer.
Cut him to pieces.
Keep the peace, I say.
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
Second a villain and a murderer?
Lord Bigot, I am none.
Who kill'd this prince?
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
There tell the king he may inquire us out.
Here's a good world!
Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death, Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
Do but hear me, sir.
Ha!
Upon my soul
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought, Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath Which was embounded in this beauteous clay, Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well.
Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
Thus have I yielded up into your hand The circle of my glory.
Take again From this my hand, as holding of the pope Your sovereign greatness and authority.
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French, And from his holiness use all your power To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
Our discontented counties do revolt; Our people quarrel with obedience, Swearing allegiance and the love of soul To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
Is this Ascension day?
Did not the prophet Say that before Ascension day at noon My crown I should give off?
Would not my lords return to me again, After they heard young Arthur was alive?
They found him dead and cast into the streets, An empty casket, where the jewel of life By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop?
why look you sad?
O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land, Send fair play orders and make compromise, Insinuation, parley and base truce To arms invasive?
shall a beardless boy, A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields, And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil, Mocking the air with colours idly spread, And find no cheque?
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
Away, then, with good courage!
yet, I know, Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince, I am not glad that such a sore of time Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt, And heal the inveterate canker of one wound By making many.
O, it grieves my soul, That I must draw this metal from my side To be a widow maker!
O, and there Where honourable rescue and defence Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
A noble temper dost thou show in this; And great affections wrestling in thy bosom Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought Between compulsion and a brave respect!
Look, where the holy legate comes apace, To give us warrant from the hand of heaven And on our actions set the name of right With holy breath.
Hail, noble prince of France!
You look but on the outside of this work.
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
By all the blood that ever fury breathed, The youth says well.
Now hear our English king; For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
Give me leave to speak.
No, I will speak.
We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war Plead for our interest and our being here.
Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.
And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
How goes the day with us?
O, tell me, Hubert.
Badly, I fear.
How fares your majesty?
This fever, that hath troubled me so long, Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge, Desires your majesty to leave the field And send him word by me which way you go.
Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
Be of good comfort; for the great supply That was expected by the Dauphin here, Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
Ay me!
this tyrant fever burns me up, And will not let me welcome this good news.
I did not think the king so stored with friends.
That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge, In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
Lead me to the revolts of England here.
When we were happy we had other names.
It is the Count Melun.
Wounded to death.
May this be possible?
may this be true?
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set, But stay'd and made the western welkin blush, When English measure backward their own ground In faint retire.
O, bravely came we off, When with a volley of our needless shot, After such bloody toil, we bid good night; And wound our tattering colours clearly up, Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
Here: what news?
Ah, foul shrewd news!
beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad to night As this hath made me.
Who was he that said King John did fly an hour or two before The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
Who's there?
speak, ho!
speak quickly, or I shoot.
A friend.
What art thou?
Of the part of England.
Whither dost thou go?
What's that to thee?
why may not I demand Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
Hubert, I think?
Who thou wilt: and if thou please, Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think I come one way of the Plantagenets.
Unkind remembrance!
Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night, To find you out.
Brief, then; and what's the news?
O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night, Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.
How did he take it?
who did taste to him?
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
Why, know you not?
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven, And tempt us not to bear above our power!
His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief That, being brought into the open air, It would allay the burning quality Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
Doth he still rage?
He is more patient Than when you left him; even now he sung.
O vanity of sickness!
fierce extremes In their continuance will not feel themselves.
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts, Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds With many legions of strange fantasies, Which, in their throng and press to that last hold, Confound themselves.
'Tis strange that death should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan, Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death, And from the organ pipe of frailty sings His soul and body to their lasting rest.
How fares your majesty?
O that there were some virtue in my tears, That might relieve you!
The salt in them is hot.
O, I am scalded with my violent motion, And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
My liege!
my lord!
but now a king, now thus.
Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, When this was now a king, and now is clay?
Art thou gone so?
He will the rather do it when he sees Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
At Worcester must his body be interr'd; For so he will'd it.
And the like tender of our love we make, To rest without a spot for evermore.
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks And knows not how to do it but with tears.
O, let us pay the time but needful woe, Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall, Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror, But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again, Come the three corners of the world in arms, And we shall shock them.
Nought shall make us rue, If England to itself do rest but true.
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
It did always seem so to us.
Is not this your son, my lord?
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.
I cannot conceive you.
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year older than this, who yet is no dearer in my account.
No, my lord.
My lord of Kent.
Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend.
My services to your lordship.
I must love you and sue to know you better.
Sir, I shall study deserving.
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
I shall, my lord.
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there.
What shall Cordelia speak?
Love, and be silent.
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, With shadowy forests and with champains riched, With plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads, We make thee lady.
To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual.
What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?
Speak.
Sir, I am made of that self mettle as my sister, And prize me at her worth.
Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s More ponderous than my tongue.
To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, No less in space, validity, and pleasure Than that conferred on Goneril.
But now, our joy, Although our last and least, to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interessed.
What can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters?
Nothing, my lord.
Nothing?
Nothing.
How?
Nothing will come of nothing.
Speak again.
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth.
I love your majesty According to my bond, no more nor less.
How, how, Cordelia?
Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.
Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, loved me.
I Return those duties back as are right fit  Obey you, love you, and most honor you.
Why have my sisters husbands if they say They love you all?
But goes thy heart with this?
Ay, good my lord.
So young and so untender?
So young, my lord, and true.
Good my liege
Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery.
Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father’s heart from her.
Call France.
Who stirs?
Call Burgundy.
Royal Lear, Whom I have ever honored as my king, Loved as my father, as my master followed, As my great patron thought on in my prayers
The bow is bent and drawn.
Make from the shaft.
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart.
Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad.
What wouldst thou do, old man?
Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows?
Kent, on thy life, no more.
Out of my sight!
Now, by Apollo
Now, by Apollo, King, Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.
O vassal!
Miscreant!
Do, kill thy physician, and the fee bestow Upon thy foul disease.
Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance hear me.
Why, fare thee well, King.
Sith thus thou wilt appear, Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, That justly think’st and hast most rightly said!
And your large speeches may your deeds approve, That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.
He’ll shape his old course in a country new.
Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
My lord of Burgundy.
We first address towards you, who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter.
What in the least Will you require in present dower with her Or cease your quest of love?
Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us we did hold her so, But now her price is fallen.
Sir, there she stands.
I know no answer.
Sir, will you, with those infirmities she owes  Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath  Take her or leave her?
Pardon me, royal sir.
Election makes not up in such conditions.
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth.
For you, great King, I would not from your love make such a stray To match you where I hate.
Therefore beseech you T' avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed Almost t' acknowledge hers.
Go to, go to.
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.
Nothing.
I have sworn.
I am firm.
I am sorry then.
You have so lost a father That you must lose a husband.
Peace be with Burgundy.
Since that respects and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.
Thou hast her, France.
Let her be thine, for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again.
Therefore be gone Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
Bid farewell to your sisters.
The jewels of our father, with washed eyes Cordelia leaves you.
I know you what you are, And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named.
Love well our father.
To your professèd bosoms I commit him.
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place.
So farewell to you both.
Prescribe not us our duty.
Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath received you At fortune’s alms.
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides, Who covers faults at last with shame derides.
Come, my fair Cordelia.
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both.
I think our father will hence tonight.
That’s most certain, and with you.
Next month with us.
'Tis the infirmity of his age.
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash.
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment.
There is further compliment of leave taking between France and him.
Pray you, let’s sit together.
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.
We shall further think on ’t.
We must do something, and i' th' heat.
Kent banished thus?
And France in choler parted?
So please your lordship, none.
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
I know no news, my lord.
What paper were you reading?
Nothing, my lord.
No?
What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?
The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.
Let’s see.
Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er read.
And for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.
Give me the letter, sir.
I shall offend, either to detain or give it.
The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
Let’s see, let’s see.
I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
It was not brought me, my lord.
There’s the cunning of it.
You know the character to be your brother’s?
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his.
But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
It is his.
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
Never, my lord.
But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
O villain, villain!
His very opinion in the letter!
Abhorred villain!
Unnatural, detested, brutish villain worse than brutish!
Go, sirrah, seek him.
I’ll apprehend him.
Abominable villain!
Where is he?
I do not well know, my lord.
Think you so?
If your honor judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening.
He cannot be such a monster
Nor is not, sure.
To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
Heaven and earth!
Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you.
Frame the business after your own wisdom.
I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects.
Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father.
This villain of mine comes under the prediction there’s son against father.
The king falls from bias of nature there’s father against child.
We have seen the best of our time.
Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.
Find out this villain, Edmund.
It shall lose thee nothing.
Do it carefully.
And the noble and true hearted Kent banished, his offense honesty!
'Tis strange, strange.
How now, brother Edmund?
What serious contemplation are you in?
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
Do you busy yourself about that?
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
Come, come.
When saw you my father last?
Why, the night gone by.
Spake you with him?
Ay, two hours together.
Parted you in good terms?
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?
None at all.
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him.
Some villain hath done me wrong.
That’s my fear.
I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower.
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.
Pray ye, go.
There’s my key.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.
Armed, brother?
Brother, I advise you to the best.
Go armed.
I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you.
Shall I hear from you anon?
I do serve you in this business.
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool?
Ay, madam.
By day and night he wrongs me.
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds.
I’ll not endure it.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle.
When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him.
Say I am sick.
He’s coming, madam.
I hear him.
Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellow servants.
I’ll have it come to question.
Very well, madam.
And let his knights have colder looks among you.
What grows of it, no matter.
Advise your fellows so.
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak.
I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course.
Go, prepare for dinner.
If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech diffuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness.
Let me not stay a jot for dinner.
Go get it ready.
A man, sir.
What dost thou profess?
What wouldst thou with us?
What art thou?
A very honest hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.
What wouldst thou?
Service.
Who wouldst thou serve?
You.
Dost thou know me, fellow?
No, sir.
But you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.
What’s that?
Authority.
What services canst thou do?
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
And the best of me is diligence.
How old art thou?
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.
I have years on my back forty  eight.
Follow me.
Thou shalt serve me.
If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
Dinner, ho, dinner!
Where’s my knave, my fool?
Go you, and call my fool hither.
So please you
What says the fellow there?
Call the clotpoll back.
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.
He would not?
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.
Ha!
Sayest thou so?
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception.
Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away.
No more of that.
I have noted it well.
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.
My lady’s father.
“My lady’s father?” My lord’s knave, your whoreson dog!
You slave, you cur!
I am none of these, my lord.
I beseech your pardon.
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
I’ll not be strucken, my lord.
Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
I thank thee, fellow.
Thou servest me, and I’ll love thee.
Come, sir, arise, away!
I’ll teach you differences.
Away, away.
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee.
Let me hire him too.
Here’s my coxcomb.
How now, my pretty knave?
How dost thou?
Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
Why, Fool?
Why?
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.
There, take my coxcomb.
Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will.
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
How now, nuncle?
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters.
Why, my boy?
Take heed, sirrah the whip.
Truth’s a dog that must to kennel.
He must be whipped out, when Lady Brach may stand by th' fire and stink.
A pestilent gall to me!
Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.
Do.
Mark it, nuncle.
This is nothing, Fool.
Why no, boy.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Prithee, tell him so much the rent of his land comes to.
He will not believe a fool.
A bitter fool.
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?
No, lad.
Teach me.
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me.
Do thou for him stand.
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear  The one in motley here, The other found out there.
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
This is not altogether fool, my lord.
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.
If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on ’t.
And ladies too  they will not let me have all fool to myself; they’ll be snatching.
Give me an egg, nuncle, and I’ll give thee two crowns.
What two crowns shall they be?
Why after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg.
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.
They’ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace.
I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool.
And yet I would not be thee, nuncle.
How now, daughter?
What makes that frontlet on?
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning.
Not only, sir, this your all licensed fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not to be endurèd riots.
Are you our daughter?
Does any here know me?
Why, this is not Lear.
Doth Lear walk thus?
Speak thus?
Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, or his discernings Are lethargied.
Ha, sleeping or waking?
Sure, ’tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?
Lear’s shadow.
I would learn that.
For by the marks Of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
Which they will make an obedient father.
Your name, fair gentlewoman?
This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savor Of other your new pranks.
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright.
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn.
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace.
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy.
Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses.
Call my train together.
Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.
Yet have I left a daughter.
You strike my people, and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters.
Woe that too late repents!
O sir, are you come?
Is it your will?
Speak, sir.
Prepare my horses.
Pray, sir, be patient.
Detested kite, thou liest!
My train are men of choice and rarest parts That all particulars of duty know And in the most exact regard support The worships of their name.
My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant, Of what hath moved you.
It may be so, my lord.
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful.
Now gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
Within a fortnight?
What’s the matter, sir?
I’ll tell thee.
Life and death!
Do you mark that, my lord?
I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you
Pray you, content.
Come, sire, no more.
What, Oswald, ho!
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool with thee.
This man hath had good counsel a hundred knights!
Well, you may fear too far.
Safer than trust too far.
Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken.
Here, madam.
How now, Oswald?
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
Ay, madam.
Take you some company, and away to horse.
Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more.
Get you gone And hasten your return.
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.
Nay, then
Well, well, th' event.
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.
If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes?
Ay, boy.
Then, I prithee, be merry.
Thy wit shall ne'er go slipshod.
Ha, ha, ha!
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly.
For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab.
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face?
No.
Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
I did her wrong
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
No.
Nor I neither.
But I can tell why a snail has a house.
Why?
I will forget my nature.
So kind a father!
Be my horses ready?
Thy asses are gone about 'em.
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
Because they are not eight?
Yes indeed.
Thou wouldst make a good fool.
To take ’t again perforce Monster ingratitude!
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time.
How’s that?
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
I would not be mad.
Keep me in temper.
I would not be mad.
Ready, my lord.
Come, boy.
She that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure, Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter.
Save thee, Curan.
And you, sir.
I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.
How comes that?
Nay, I know not.
You have heard of the news abroad?
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear kissing arguments.
Not I.   Pray you, what are they?
Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Not a word.
You may do then in time.
Fare you well, sir.
The duke be here tonight?
I am sure on ’t, not a word.
I hear my father coming.
Pardon me.
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
Draw.
Seem to defend yourself.
Now quit you well.
Yield!
Come before my father.
Light, ho!
Here!
Fly, brother, fly.
Torches, torches!
So, farewell.
Now Edmund, where’s the villain?
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon To stand ’s auspicious mistress
But where is he?
Look, sir, I bleed.
Where is the villain, Edmund?
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could
Pursue him, ho!
Go after.
Let him fly far.
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught.
And found dispatch.
The noble duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.
By his authority I will proclaim it That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks, Bringing the murderous coward to the stake.
He that conceals him, death.
When I dissuaded him from his intent, And found him pight to do it, with cursed speech I threatened to discover him.
He replied, “Thou unpossessing bastard!
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faithed?
O strange and fastened villain!
Would he deny his letter, said he?
I never got him.
Hark, the duke’s trumpets.
I know not why he comes.
How now, my noble friend?
Since I came hither, Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
If it be true, all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue th' offender.
How dost, my lord?
O madam, my old heart is cracked, it’s cracked.
What, did my father’s godson seek your life?
He whom my father named, your Edgar?
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid.
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father?
I know not, madam.
'Tis too bad, too bad.
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
No marvel then, though he were ill affected.
'Tis they have put him on the old man’s death, To have th' expense and spoil of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there.
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.
It was my duty, sir.
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.
Is he pursued?
Ay, my good lord.
If he be taken, he shall never more Be feared of doing harm.
Make your own purpose How in my strength you please.
For you, Edmund, Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.
You we first seize on.
I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else.
For him I thank your grace.
You know not why we came to visit you
I serve you, madam.
Your graces are right welcome.
Good dawning to thee, friend.
Art of this house?
Ay.
Where may we set our horses?
I' th' mire.
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
I love thee not.
Why, then, I care not for thee.
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.
Why dost thou use me thus?
I know thee not.
Fellow, I know thee.
What dost thou know me for?
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
What a brazen faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me!
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king?
Away!
I have nothing to do with thee.
Draw, you rascal.
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father.
Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks.
Draw, you rascal!
Come your ways.
Help, ho!
Murder!
Help!
Strike, you slave.
Stand, rogue.
Stand, you neat slave, strike!
Help, ho!
Murder, murder!
How now?
What’s the matter?
Part.
With you, goodman boy, if you please.
Come, I’ll flesh ye.
Come on, young master.
Weapons, arms?
What’s the matter here?
Keep peace, upon your lives.
He dies that strikes again.
What is the matter?
The messengers from our sister and the king.
What is your difference?
Speak.
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor.
You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee.
A tailor made thee.
Thou art a strange fellow.
A tailor make a man?
Ay, a tailor, sir.
A stone cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o' th' trade.
Speak yet.
This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his gray beard
Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!
My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him.
Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
Peace, sirrah!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
Why art thou angry?
That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty.
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
How fell you out?
Say that.
No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave.
Why dost thou call him “knave?” What’s his offense?
His countenance likes me not.
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
This is some fellow, Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature.
He cannot flatter, he.
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth.
An they will take it, so.
Sir, in good faith, or in sincere verity, Under th' allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus' front
What mean’st by this?
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much.
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.
What was th' offense you gave him?
I never gave him any.
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool.
Fetch forth the stocks, ho!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart, We’ll teach you.
Sir, I am too old to learn.
Call not your stocks for me.
I serve the king, On whose employment I was sent to you.
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger.
Fetch forth the stocks!
As I have life and honor, there shall he sit till noon.
Till noon?
Till night, my lord, and all night too.
Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog, You should not use me so.
Sir, being his knave, I will.
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of.
Come, bring away the stocks!
Let me beseech your grace not to do so.
His fault is much, and the good king his master Will check him for ’t.
Your purposed low correction Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches For pilferings and most common trespasses Are punished with.
The king his master needs must take it ill, That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrained.
I’ll answer that.
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused, assaulted For following her affairs.
Put in his legs.
Come, my good lord, away.
I am sorry for thee, friend.
'Tis the duke’s pleasure, Whose disposition, all the world well knows, Will not be rubbed nor stopped.
I’ll entreat for thee.
Pray you do not, sir.
I have watched and traveled hard.
The duke’s to blame in this.
'Twill be ill taken.
Good King, that must approve the common saw, Thou out of heaven’s benediction comest To the warm sun.
Approach, thou beacon to this underglobe, That by thy comfortable beams I may Peruse this letter.
Nothing almost sees miracles But misery.
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home, And not send back my messenger.
As I learned, The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove.
Hail to thee, noble master!
Ha!
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
No, my lord.
Ha, ha!
Look, he wears cruel garters.
Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs.
When a man’s overlusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether stocks.
What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here?
It is both he and she: Your son and daughter.
No.
Yes.
No, I say.
I say “Yea.
No, no, they would not.
Yes, they have.
By Jupiter, I swear “No.
By Juno, I swear “Ay.
They durst not do ’t.
They could not, would not do ’t.
My lord, when at their home I did commend your highness' letters to them.
Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind.
But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind.
Fortune, that arrant whore, Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio , down, thou climbing sorrow.
Thy element’s below.
Where is this daughter?
With the earl, sir, here within.
Follow me not.
Stay here.
Made you no more offense but what you speak of?
None.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question, thou’dst well deserved it.
Why, Fool?
Where learned you this, Fool?
Not i' th' stocks, fool.
Deny to speak with me?
They are sick?
They are weary?
They have traveled all the night?
mere fetches, ay!
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.
My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the duke, How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course.
Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!
Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.
“Informed them?” Dost thou understand me, man?
Ay, my good lord.
The king would speak with Cornwall.
The dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends service.
Are they “informed” of this?
My breath and blood!
“Fiery?” The “fiery” duke?
I would have all well betwixt you.
O me, my heart, my rising heart!
But down.
Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i' th' paste alive.
She knapped 'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried, “Down, wantons, down!
” 'Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
Good morrow to you both.
Hail to your grace.
I am glad to see your highness.
Regan, I think you are.
I pray you, sir, take patience.
Say, how is that?
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation.
If, sir, perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers, 'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame.
My curses on her!
O sir, you are old.
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine.
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself.
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return.
Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house?
“Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.
Age is unnecessary.
On my knees I beg That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.
Good sir, no more.
These are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister.
Never, Regan.
She hath abated me of half my train, Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue, Most serpentlike, upon the very heart.
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top!
Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness!
Fie, sir, fie!
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes!
Infect her beauty, You fen sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun, To fall and blister!
O the blessed gods!
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
Thy tender hafted nature shall not give Thee o'er to harshness.
Her eyes are fierce, but thine Do comfort and not burn.
Good sir, to the purpose.
Who put my man i' th' stocks?
What trumpet’s that?
I know ’t my sister’s.
This approves her letter That she would soon be here.
Is your lady come?
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out, varlet, from my sight!
What means your grace?
Who stocked my servant?
Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t.
Who comes here?
O heavens, If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience, if yourselves are old, Make it your cause.
Send down, and take my part!
Why not by th' hand, sir?
How have I offended?
All’s not offense that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so.
O sides, you are too tough.
Will you yet hold?
How came my man i' th' stocks?
You!
Did you?
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?
At your choice, sir.
Now, I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
I will not trouble thee, my child.
Farewell.
We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter  Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine.
Thou art a boil, A plague sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood.
But I’ll not chide thee.
Let shame come when it will.
I do not call it.
I do not bid the thunder bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high judging Jove.
Mend when thou canst.
Be better at thy leisure.
I can be patient.
I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.
Not altogether so, sir.
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome.
Give ear, sir, to my sister.
For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so  But she knows what she does.
Is this well spoken now?
I dare avouch it, sir.
What, fifty followers?
Is it not well?
What should you need of more  Yea, or so many  sith that both charge and danger Speak 'gainst so great a number?
How, in one house, Should many people under two commands Hold amity?
'Tis hard; almost impossible.
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
Why not, my lord?
If then they chanced to slack you, We could control them.
I gave you all
And in good time you gave it.
Made you my guardians, my depositaries, But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number.
What, must I come to you With five and twenty, Regan?
Said you so?
And speak ’t again, my lord.
No more with me.
Those wicked creatures yet do look well favored When others are more wicked.
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise.
I’ll go with thee.
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty, And thou art twice her love.
Hear me, my lord.
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?
What need one?
O, reason not the need!
Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
Let us withdraw.
'Twill be a storm.
This house is little.
The old man and his people Cannot be well bestowed.
'Tis his own blame.
Hath put himself from rest, And must needs taste his folly.
So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?
Followed the old man forth.
He is returned.
The king is in high rage.
Whither is he going?
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
'Tis best to give him way.
He leads himself.
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds Do sorely ruffle.
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush.
O sir, to wilful men, The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters.
Shut up your doors.
Shut up your doors, my lord.
'Tis a wild night.
My Regan counsels well.
Come out o' th' storm.
Who’s there, besides foul weather?
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
I know you.
Where’s the king?
Contending with the fretful elements.
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curlèd water 'bove the main, That things might change or cease.
Tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of.
But who is with him?
None but the fool, who labors to outjest His heart struck injuries.
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.
No, do not.
For confirmation that I am much more Than my outwall, open this purse and take What it contains.
If you shall see Cordelia  As fear not but you shall show her this ring.
And she will tell you who that fellow is That yet you do not know.
Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the king.
Give me your hand.
Have you no more to say?
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!
Rage, blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!
You sulfurous and thought executing fires, Vaunt couriers of oak cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head!
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door.
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing.
Here’s a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
Rumble thy bellyful!
Spit, fire!
Spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good headpiece.
The codpiece that will house Before the head has any  The head and he shall louse.
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe What he his heart should make Shall of a corn cry woe, And turn his sleep to wake.
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.
No, I will be the pattern of all patience.
I will say nothing.
Who’s there?
Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece that’s a wise man and a fool.
Alas, sir, are you here?
Things that love night Love not such nights as these.
The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves.
Since I was man, Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never Remember to have heard.
Man’s nature cannot carry Th' affliction nor the fear.
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now.
Tremble, thou wretch That hast within thee undivulgèd crimes Unwhipped of justice.
Hide thee, thou bloody hand, Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue That art incestuous.
Caitiff, to pieces shake, That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practiced on man’s life.
My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy.
How dost, my boy?
Art cold?I am cold myself.
Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange That can make vile things precious.
True, my good boy.
Come, bring us to this hovel.
This is a brave night to cool a courtesan.
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.
Most savage and unnatural!
Go to, say you nothing.
There’s a division betwixt the dukes.
And a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this night.
'Tis dangerous to be spoken.
I have locked the letter in my closet.
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home.
There’s part of a power already footed.
We must incline to the king.
I will look him and privily relieve him.
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke Instantly know, and of that letter too.
Here is the place, my lord.
Good my lord, enter.
The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure.
Let me alone.
Good my lord, enter here.
Wilt break my heart?
I had rather break mine own.
Good my lord, enter.
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin.
So ’tis to thee.
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.
Good my lord, enter here.
Prithee, go in thyself.
Seek thine own ease.
Fathom and half, fathom and half!
Poor Tom!
Come not in here, nuncle.
Here’s a spirit.
Give me thy hand.
Who’s there?
A spirit, a spirit.
He says his name’s Poor Tom.
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
Come forth.
Away!
The foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum!
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing?
Wouldst thou give 'em all?
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men’s faults light on thy daughters!
He hath no daughters, sir.
Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill.
Alow, alow, loo, loo!
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
Take heed o' th' foul fiend.
Obey thy parents, keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array.
Tom’s a  cold.
What hast thou been?
Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
Is man no more than this?
Consider him well.
Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.
Ha!
Here’s three on ’s are sophisticated.
Thou art the thing itself.
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.
Off, off, you lendings!
Come.
Unbutton here.
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.
Look, here comes a walking fire.
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock.
He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye and makes the harelip, mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth.
St.   Withold footed thrice the 'old.
He met the nightmare and her ninefold, Bid her alight, And her troth plight.
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
How fares your grace?
What’s he?
Who’s there?
What is ’t you seek?
What are you there?
Your names?
What, hath your grace no better company?
The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.
Modo he’s called, and Mahu.
Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile That it doth hate what gets it.
Poor Tom’s a cold.
Go in with me.
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?
I’ll talk a word with this same learnèd Theban.
What is your study?
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
Let me ask you one word in private.
Importune him once more to go, my lord.
His wits begin t' unsettle.
Canst thou blame him?
O, cry your mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.
Tom’s a cold.
In, fellow.
There, into th' hovel.
Keep thee warm.
Come let’s in all.
This way, my lord.
With him!
I will keep still with my philosopher.
Good my lord, soothe him.
Let him take the fellow.
Take him you on.
Sirrah, come on.
Go along with us.
Come, good Athenian.
No words, no words.
Hush.
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just!
This is the letter which he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France.
Go with me to the duchess.
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.
True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.
Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.
If I find him comforting the king, it will stuff his suspicion more fully.
I will persevere in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.
Here is better than the open air.
Take it thankfully.
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.
I will not be long from you.
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.
The gods reward your kindness!
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman?
A king, a king!
To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon 'em!
The foul fiend bites my back.
He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s health, a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath.
It shall be done.
I will arraign them straight.
Come, sit thou here, most learnèd justicer.
Thou, sapient sir, sit here.
Now, you she foxes
Look, where he stands and glares!
Want’st thou eyes at trial, madam?
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring.
Croak not, black angel.
I have no food for thee.
How do you, sir?
Stand you not so amazed.
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
I’ll see their trial first.
Bring in the evidence.
Thou robèd man of justice, take thy place.
And thou, his yoke fellow of equity, Bench by his side.
You are o' th' commission.
Sit you too.
Let us deal justly.
Arraign her first.
'Tis Goneril.
I here take my oath before this honorable assembly, she kicked the poor king her father.
Come hither, mistress.
Is your name Goneril?
She cannot deny it.
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint stool.
And here’s another, whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on.
Stop her there!
Arms, arms, sword, fire, corruption in the place!
False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?
Bless thy five wits.
O pity!
Sir, where is the patience now, That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
My tears begin to take his part so much, They’ll mar my counterfeiting.
The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart see, they bark at me.
Tom will throw his head at them.
Avaunt, you curs!
Be thy mouth or black or white, Tooth that poisons if it bite, Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim, Hound or spaniel, brach or him, Bobtail tyke or trundle tail  Tom will make them weep and wail.
For with throwing thus my head, Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
Do de, de de.
Cessez!
Come, march to wakes and fairs
Then let them anatomize Regan.
See what breeds about her heart.
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts?
You, sir, I entertain you for one of my hundred.
Only I do not like the fashion of your garments.
You will say they are Persian attire, but let them be changed.
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
Make no noise, make no noise.
Draw the curtains so, so, so.
We’ll go to supper i' th' morning.
So, so, so.
And I’ll go to bed at noon.
Come hither, friend.
Where is the king my master?
Here, sir, but trouble him not.
His wits are gone.
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms.
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.
There is a litter ready.
Oppressèd nature sleeps.
Come, come, away.
When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers, suffers most i' th' mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now When that which makes me bend makes the king bow.
Post speedily to my lord your husband.
Show him this letter.
The army of France is landed.
Seek out the traitor Gloucester.
Hang him instantly.
Pluck out his eyes.
Leave him to my displeasure.
Edmund, keep you our sister company.
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.
Advise the duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation.
We are bound to the like.
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.
Farewell, dear sister.
Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.
Get horses for your mistress.
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
Edmund, farewell.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.
Bind fast his corky arms.
What mean your graces?
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.
Do me no foul play, friends.
Bind him, I say.
Hard, hard.
O filthy traitor!
Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.
To this chair bind him.
By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard.
So white, and such a traitor?
Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee.
I am your host.
With robbers' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus.
What will you do?
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
Be simple answered, for we know the truth.
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom?
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king.
Speak.
Cunning.
And false.
Where hast thou sent the king?
To Dover.
Wherefore to Dover?
Wast thou not charged at peril
Wherefore to Dover?
Let him first answer that.
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell black night endured, would have buoyed up, And quenched the stellèd fires.
Yet poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, “Good porter, turn the key,” All cruèls else subscribed.
“See” ’t shalt thou never.
Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.
He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help!
One side will mock another th' other too.
If you see vengeance
Hold your hand, my lord!
I have served you ever since I was a child.
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold.
How now, you dog?
If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I’d shake it on this quarrel.
What do you mean?
My villain!
Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
Give me thy sword.
A peasant stand up thus?

Oh, I am slain!
My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him.
Oh!
Lest it see more, prevent it.
Out, vile jelly!
Where is thy luster now?
All dark and comfortless.
Where’s my son Edmund?
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature To quit this horrid act.
Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call’st on him that hates thee.
O my follies!
Then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell His way to Dover.
I have received a hurt.
Follow me, lady.
Turn out that eyeless villain.
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.
Regan, I bleed apace.
Untimely comes this hurt.
Give me your arm.
I’ll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.
If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters.
Let’s follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would.
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing.
Go thou.
I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face.
Now heaven help him!
O my good lord, I have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years.
Away, get thee away.
Good friend, be gone.
Thy comforts can do me no good at all.
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.
I stumbled when I saw.
Full oft ’tis seen, Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities.
How now?
Who’s there?
O gods!
'Tis poor mad Tom.
And worse I may be yet.
The worst is not So long as we can say “This is the worst.
Fellow, where goest?
Is it a beggarman?
Madman and beggar too.
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
I' th' last night’s storm I such a fellow saw, Which made me think a man a worm.
My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him.
I have heard more since.
As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.
How should this be?
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow, Angering itself and others.
Bless thee, master!
Is that the naked fellow?
Ay, my lord.
Then prithee, get thee gone.
Alack, sir, he is mad.
'Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee.
Or rather, do thy pleasure.
Above the rest, be gone.
I’ll bring him the best 'parel that I have, Come on ’t what will.
Sirrah, naked fellow
Poor Tom’s a cold.
I cannot daub it further.
Come hither, fellow.
And yet I must.
Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
Know’st thou the way to Dover?
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues Have humbled to all strokes.
That I am wretched Makes thee the happier.
Heavens, deal so still.
Ay, master.
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep.
Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me.
From that place I shall no leading need.
Give me thy arm.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
Welcome, my lord.
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way.
Madam, within but never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed.
Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit That dares not undertake.
He’ll not feel wrongs Which tie him to an answer.
Yours in the ranks of death.
My most dear Gloucester!
Madam, here comes my lord.
I have been worth the whistle.
O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face.
I fear your disposition.
That nature, which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
No more.
The text is foolish.
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.
Filths savor but themselves.
What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?
See thyself, devil!
O vain fool!
Thou changèd and self covered thing, for shame!
Marry, your manhood, mew!
What news?
Gloucester’s eyes?
Both, both, my lord.
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.
'Tis from your sister.
One way I like this well.
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life.
Another way The news is not so tart.
I’ll read and answer.
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Come with my lady hither.
He is not here.
No, my good lord.
I met him back again.
Knows he the wickedness?
Ay, my good lord.
'Twas he informed against him, And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course.
Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou showed’st the king, And to revenge thine eyes.
Come hither, friend.
Tell me what more thou know’st.
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
Who hath he left behind him general?
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
Ay, sir.
She took them, read them in my presence, And now and then an ample tear trilled down Her delicate cheek.
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel like, Sought to be king o'er her.
O, then it moved her?
Not to a rage.
Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest.
You have seen Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears Were like a better way.
Made she no verbal question?
Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father” Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart, Cried, “Sisters, sisters!
Shame of ladies, sisters!
Kent, father, sisters!
What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?
Let pity not be believed.
” There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamor moistened.
It is the stars, The stars above us, govern our conditions.
Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues.
You spoke not with her since?
No.
Was this before the king returned?
No, since.
Why, good sir?
A sovereign shame so elbows him.
Alack, poor gentleman!
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?
'Tis so.
They are afoot.
Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him.
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance.
I pray you, go Along with me.
Alack, ’tis he.
Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn.
A century send forth.
Search every acre in the high grown field, And bring him to our eye.
There is means, madam.
News, madam.
The British powers are marching hitherward.
'Tis known before.
Our preparation stands In expectation of them.
O dear father, It is thy business that I go about.
But are my brother’s powers set forth?
Ay, madam.
Himself in person there?
Madam, with much ado.
Your sister is the better soldier.
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
No, madam.
What might import my sister’s letter to him?
I know not, lady.
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live.
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us.
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life; moreover to descry The strength o' th' enemy.
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
Our troops set forth tomorrow.
Stay with us.
The ways are dangerous.
I may not, madam.
My lady charged my duty in this business.
Why should she write to Edmund?
Might not you Transport her purposes by word?
Belike Some things I know not what.
I’ll love thee much.
Let me unseal the letter.
Madam, I had rather
I know your lady does not love her husband.
I am sure of that.
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund.
I know you are of her bosom.
I, madam?
I speak in understanding.
Y' are.
Fare thee well.
When shall we come to th' top of that same hill?
You do climb up it now.
Look how we labor.
Methinks the ground is even.
Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?
No, truly.
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish.
So may it be indeed.
Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
You’re much deceived.
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.
Methinks you’re better spoken.
Come on, sir.
Here’s the place.
Stand still.
How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles.
Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice.
Set me where you stand.
Give me your hand.
You are now within a foot Of th' extreme verge.
For all beneath the moon Would I not leap upright.
Let go my hand.
Here, friend, ’s another purse, in it a jewel Well worth a poor man’s taking.
Fairies and gods Prosper it with thee!
Go thou farther off.
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
Now fare you well, good sir.
With all my heart.
Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it.
Gone, sir.
Farewell.
And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life when life itself Yields to the theft.
Had he been where he thought, By this had thought been past.
Alive or dead?
Ho you, sir, friend!
Hear you, sir?
Speak.
Thus might he pass indeed.
Yet he revives.
What are you, sir?
Away, and let me die.
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, So many fathom down precipitating, Thou’dst shivered like an egg.
But thou dost breathe, Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art sound.
But have I fall'n, or no?
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a height.
The shrill gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard.
Do but look up.
Alack, I have no eyes.
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit, To end itself by death?
'Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will.
Give me your arm.
Up so.
How is ’t?
Feel you your legs?
You stand.
Too well, too well.
This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you?
A poor unfortunate beggar.
As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons.
He had a thousand noses, Horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea.
It was some fiend.
Therefore, thou happy father, Think that the clearest gods, who make them honors Of men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.
I do remember now.
Henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself, “Enough, enough,” and die.
Bear free and patient thoughts.
No, they cannot touch me for coining.
I am the king himself.
O thou side piercing sight!
Nature’s above art in that respect.
There’s your press  money.
That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper.
Sweet marjoram.
Pass.
I know that voice.
Ha!
Goneril with a white beard?
Ha, Regan?
They flattered me like a dog and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there.
To say “Ay” and “No” to everything that I said “Ay” and “No” to was no good divinity.
When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out.
Go to, they are not men o' their words.
They told me I was everything.
'Tis a lie, I am not ague proof.
The trick of that voice I do well remember.
Is ’t not the king?
Ay, every inch a king!
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man’s life.
What was thy cause?
Adultery?
Thou shalt not die.
Die for adultery?
No.
The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight.
O, let me kiss that hand!
Let me wipe it first.
It smells of mortality.
O ruined piece of nature!
This great world Shall so wear out to naught.
Dost thou know me?
I remember thine eyes well enough.
Dost thou squiny at me?
No, do thy worst, blind Cupid.
I’ll not love.
Read thou this challenge.
Mark but the penning of it.
Were all thy letters suns, I could not see one.
I would not take this from report.
It is, And my heart breaks at it.
Read.
What, with the case of eyes?
Oh ho, are you there with me?
No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?
I see it feelingly.
What, art mad?
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.
Look with thine ears.
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief.
Hark in thine ear: change places and, handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?
Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
Ay, sir.
And the creature run from the cur?
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand.
Why dost thou lash that whore?
Strip thine own back.
Thou hotly lust’st to use her in that kind For which thou whipp’st her.
The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tattered clothes great vices do appear; Robes and furred gowns hide all.
Plate sin with gold, And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.
Arm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.
None does offend none, I say, none.
I’ll able 'em.
O matter and impertinency mixed!
Reason in madness!
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough.
Thy name is Gloucester.
Thou must be patient.
We came crying hither.
Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry.
I will preach to thee.
Mark me.
Alack, alack the day!
When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools.
This a good block.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt.
I’ll put ’t in proof.
And when I have stol'n upon these sons in law, Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
Oh, here he is.
Lay hand upon him.
Sir, Your most dear daughter
No rescue?
What, a prisoner?
I am even The natural fool of fortune.
Use me well.
You shall have ransom.
Let me have surgeons.
You shall have anything.
No seconds?
All myself?
Good sir
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.
What, I will be jovial.
Come, come.
I am a king, my masters, know you that?
You are a royal one, and we obey you.
Then there’s life in ’t.
Come, an if you get it, you shall get it by running.
Sa, sa, sa, sa.
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king.
Thou hast a daughter Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to.
Hail, gentle sir.
Sir, speed you.
What’s your will?
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
Most sure and vulgar.
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound.
But, by your favor, How near’s the other army?
Near and on speedy foot.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
I thank you, sir.
That’s all.
Though that the queen on special cause is here, Her army is moved on.
I thank you, sir.
You ever gentle gods, take my breath from me.
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please.
Well pray you, father.
Now, good sir, what are you?
Hearty thanks.
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot.
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t.
Wherefore, bold peasant, Darest thou support a published traitor?
Hence, Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee.
Let go his arm.
'Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk pass.
An 'chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life, ’twould not ha' bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight.
Nay, come not near th' old man.
Keep out, che vor' ye, or I’se try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder.
Out, dunghill!
'Chill pick your teeth, zir.
Come, no matter vor your foins.
Slave, thou hast slain me.
Villain, take my purse.
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.
And give the letters which thou find’st about me To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester.
Seek him out Upon the British party.
O untimely death!
I know thee well a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.
What, is he dead?
Sit you down, father.
Rest you.
Let’s see these pockets.
The letters that he speaks of May be my friends.
He’s dead.
I am only sorry He had no other death’s man.
Let us see.
Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not.
To know our enemies' minds, we rip their hearts.
Give me your hand.
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness?
My life will be too short, And every measure fail me.
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
All my reports go with the modest truth, Nor more, nor clipped, but so.
Be better suited.
These weeds are memories of those worser hours.
I prithee, put them off.
Then be ’t so, my good lord.
How does the king?
Madam, sleeps still.
So please your majesty That we may wake the king?
He hath slept long.
Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed I' th' sway of your own will.
Is he arrayed?
Ay, madam.
In the heaviness of his sleep We put fresh garments on him.
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
I doubt not of his temperance.
Very well.
Please you, draw near.
Louder the music there!
O my dear father, restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made!
Kind and dear princess!
Had you not been their father, these white flakes Did challenge pity of them.
Madam, do you.
'Tis fittest.
How does my royal lord?
How fares your majesty?
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.
Sir, do you know me?
You are a spirit, I know.
Where did you die?
Still, still far wide!
He’s scarce awake.
Let him alone awhile.
Where have I been?
Where am I?
Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused.
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus.
I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands.
Let’s see.
I feel this pinprick.
Would I were assured Of my condition.
Pray, do not mock me.
I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less.
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man.
Yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant What place this is, and all the skill I have Remembers not these garments.
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night.
Do not laugh at me, For as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child Cordelia.
And so I am, I am.
Be your tears wet?
Yes, faith.
I pray, weep not.
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me, for your sisters Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
No cause, no cause.
Am I in France?
In your own kingdom, sir.
Do not abuse me.
Be comforted, good madam.
The great rage, You see, is killed in him.
And yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in.
Trouble him no more Till further settling.
Will ’t please your highness walk?
You must bear with me.
Pray you now, forget and forgive.
I am old and foolish.
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
Most certain, sir.
Who is conductor of his people?
As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
Report is changeable.
Tis time to look about.
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.
The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
Fare you well, sir.
My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.
Know of the duke if his last purpose hold, Or whether since he is advised by aught To change the course.
He’s full of alteration And self reproving.
Bring his constant pleasure.
Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.
'Tis to be doubted, madam.
Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you.
Tell me but truly  but then speak the truth  Do you not love my sister?
In honored love.
But have you never found my brother’s way To the forfended place?
That thought abuses you.
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.
No, by mine honor, madam.
Fear me not.
She and the duke her husband!
I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen him and me.
Our very loving sister, well be met.
Sir, this I hear: the king is come to his daughter, With others whom the rigor of our state Forced to cry out.
Where I could not be honest I never yet was valiant.
Sir, you speak nobly.
Why is this reasoned?
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings.
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
Sister, you’ll go with us?
No.
'Tis most convenient.
Pray you, go with us.
Oh ho, I know the riddle.
I’ll overtake you.
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound For him that brought it.
Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove What is avouchèd there.
Stay till I have read the letter.
I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.
Why, fare thee well.
I will o'erlook thy paper.
The enemy’s in view.
Draw up your powers.
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery, but your haste Is now urged on you.
We will greet the time.
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree For your good host.
Pray that the right may thrive.
If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.
Grace go with you, sir.
Away, old man.
Give me thy hand.
Away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
Give me thy hand.
Come on.
No further, sir.
A man may rot even here.
What, in ill thoughts again?
Men must endure Their going hence even as their coming hither.
Ripeness is all.
Come on.
And that’s true too.
Some officers take them away.
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.
We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressèd King, I am cast down.
No, no, no, no!
Come, let’s away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness.
Take them away.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense.
Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes.
Wipe thine eyes.
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep.
We’ll see 'em starve first.
Come.
Come hither, captain.
Hark.
Take thou this note.
Go follow them to prison.
One step I have advanced thee.
If thou dost As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes.
Know thou this: that men Are as the time is.
To be tender minded Does not become a sword.
Thy great employment Will not bear question.
Either say thou'lt do ’t, Or thrive by other means.
I’ll do ’t, my lord.
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.
If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t.
Sir, you have shown today your valiant strain, And fortune led you well.
You have the captives That were the opposites of this day’s strife.
I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.
Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.
That’s as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far.
Not so hot.
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition.
In my rights, By me invested, he compeers the best.
That were the most if he should husband you.
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.
Lady, I am not well, else I should answer From a full flowing stomach.
General, Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.
Dispose of them, of me.
The walls is thine.
Witness the world that I create thee here My lord and master.
Mean you to enjoy him then?
The let alone lies not in your good will.
Nor in thine, lord.
Half blooded fellow, yes.
Let the drum strike and prove my title thine.
Stay yet.
An interlude!
Thou art armed, Gloucester.
Let the trumpet sound.
If none appear to prove upon thy person Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, There is my pledge.
I’ll make it on thy heart, Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaimed thee.
Sick, oh, sick!
If not, I’ll ne'er trust medicine.
There’s my exchange.
What in the world he is That names me traitor, villainlike he lies.
Call by thy trumpet.
A herald, ho!
A herald, ho, a herald!
Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers, All levied in my name, have in my name Took their discharge.
My sickness grows upon me.
She is not well.
Convey her to my tent.
Sound, trumpet!
Again!
Again!
Ask him his purposes, why he appears Upon this call o' th' trumpet.
What are you?
Your name, your quality, and why you answer This present summons?
O, know, my name is lost.
By treason’s tooth bare gnawn and canker bit.
Which is that adversary?
What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
Himself.
What sayst thou to him?
In wisdom I should ask thy name.
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike, And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes, What safe and nicely I might well delay By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
Save him, save him!
This is practice, Gloucester.
By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite.
Thou art not vanquished, But cozened and beguiled.
Shut your mouth, dame, Or with this paper shall I stop it.
Say, if I do?
The laws are mine, not thine.
Who can arraign me for ’t?
Most monstrous, oh!
Know’st thou this paper?
Ask me not what I know.
Go after her.
She’s desperate.
Govern her.
What you have charged me with, that have I done  And more, much more.
The time will bring it out.
'Tis past, and so am I.
But what art thou That hast this fortune on me?
If thou'rt noble, I do forgive thee.
Let’s exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
If more, the more thou’st wronged me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
Thou’st spoken right.
'Tis true.
The wheel is come full circle.
I am here.
Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness.
I must embrace thee.
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father.
Worthy prince, I know ’t.
Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?
By nursing them, my lord.
List a brief tale, And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape, That followed me so near  O our lives' sweetness, That we the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once!
taught me to shift Into a madman’s rags, t' assume a semblance That very dogs disdained.
This speech of yours hath moved me, And shall perchance do good.
But speak you on.
You look as you had something more to say.
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in.
For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this.
But who was this?
Help, help, O, help!
What kind of help?
Speak, man.
What means that bloody knife?
'Tis hot, it smokes.
It came even from the heart of oh, she’s dead!
Who dead?
Speak, man.
Your lady, sir, your lady.
And her sister By her is poisoned.
She confesses it.
I was contracted to them both.
All three Now marry in an instant.
Here comes Kent.
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
This judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble Touches us not with pity.
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night.
Is he not here?
Great thing of us forgot!
Speak, Edmund, where’s the king?
And where’s Cordelia?
Alack, why thus?
Yet Edmund was beloved.
The one the other poisoned for my sake, And after slew herself.
Even so.
Cover their faces.
I pant for life.
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.
Run, run, O, run!
To who, my lord?
Who hath the office?
Send Thy token of reprieve.
Haste thee for thy life.
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.
The gods defend her!
bear him hence awhile.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Oh, you are men of stones.
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.
She’s gone forever.
I know when one is dead and when one lives.
She’s dead as earth.
Lend me a looking glass.
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why then, she lives.
Is this the promised end?
Or image of that horror?
Fall and cease.
This feather stirs.
She lives.
If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt.
O my good master!
Prithee, away.
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her.
Now she’s gone for ever.
Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.
Ha?
What is ’t thou say’st?
Her voice was ever soft, Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I killed the slave that was a hanging thee.
'Tis true, my lords, he did.
Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip.
I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me.
Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' th' best, I’ll tell you straight.
If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated, One of them we behold.
This a dull sight.
Are you not Kent?
The same.
Your servant Kent.
Where is your servant Caius?
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.
He’ll strike, and quickly too.
He’s dead and rotten.
No, my good lord.
I am the very man
I’ll see that straight.
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps.
You’re welcome hither.
Nor no man else.
All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead.
Ay, so I think.
Very bootless.
Edmund is dead, my lord.
That’s but a trifle here.
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
And my poor fool is hanged.
No, no, no life?
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life, And thou no breath at all?
Oh, thou'lt come no more, Never, never, never, never, never.
Pray you, undo this button.
Thank you, sir.
Do you see this?
Look on her.
Look, her lips.
Look there, look there.
O, O, O, O.
He faints!
My lord, my lord!
Break, heart.
I prithee, break!
Look up, my lord.
Vex not his ghost.
O, let him pass.
He hates him That would upon the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer.
Oh, he is gone indeed.
The wonder is he hath endured so long.
He but usurped his life.
Bear them from hence.
Our present business Is to general woe.
Friends of my soul, you twain Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please: I only swore to study with your grace And stay here in your court for three years' space.
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study?
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
These be the stops that hinder study quite And train our intellects to vain delight.
How well he's read, to reason against reading!
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
The spring is near when green geese are a breeding.
How follows that?
Fit in his place and time.
In reason nothing.
Something then in rhyme.
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost, That bites the first born infants of the spring.
Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
'Item, That no woman shall come within a mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
Four days ago.
Let's see the penalty.
'On pain of losing her tongue.  '
Who devised this penalty?
Marry, that did I.
Sweet lord, and why?
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
A dangerous law against gentility!
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.  '
What say you, lords?
Why, this was quite forgot.
Ay, that there is.
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport; And so to study, three years is but short.
Which is the duke's own person?
This, fellow: what wouldst?
This is he.
Signior Arme  Arme  commends you.
There's villany abroad: this letter will tell you more.
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
A letter from the magnificent Armado.
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
To hear?
or forbear laughing?
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to forbear both.
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness.
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
In what manner?
For the following, sir?
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend the right!
Will you hear this letter with attention?
As we would hear an oracle.
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god, and body's fostering patron.  '
Not a word of Costard yet.
'So it is,'
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.
Peace!
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
No words!
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
Me?
'that unlettered small knowing soul,'
Me?
'that shallow vassal,'
Still me?
'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'
O, me!
'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, which with,  O, with  but with this I passion to say wherewith,
With a wench.
'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman.
Him I, as my ever esteemed duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.  '
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
'For Jaquenetta,  so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain,   I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial.
Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heart burning heat of duty.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO.  '
Ay, the best for the worst.
But, sirrah, what say you to this?
Sir, I confess the wench.
Did you hear the proclamation?
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it.
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken with a wench.
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.  '
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.  '
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat, These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity!
Affliction may one day smile again; and
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
Why, sadness is one and the self same thing, dear imp.
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senor.
Why tough senor?
why tough senor?
Why tender juvenal?
why tender juvenal?
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.
Pretty and apt.
How mean you, sir?
Thou pretty, because little.
Little pretty, because little.
Wherefore apt?
And therefore apt, because quick.
Speak you this in my praise, master?
In thy condign praise.
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
What, that an eel is ingenious?
That an eel is quick.
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
I am answered, sir.
I love not to be crossed.
He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
You may do it in an hour, sir.
Impossible.
How many is one thrice told?
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a complete man.
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of deuce ace amounts to.
It doth amount to one more than two.
Which the base vulgar do call three.
True.
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study?
A most fine figure!
To prove you a cipher.
Hercules, master.
Most sweet Hercules!
O well knit Samson!
strong jointed Samson!
I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates.
I am in love too.
Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?
A woman, master.
Of what complexion?
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
Of the sea water green, sir.
Is that one of the four complexions?
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it.
He surely affected her for her wit.
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
My love is most immaculate white and red.
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours.
Define, define, well educated infant.
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and pathetical!
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
To be whipped; and yet a better love than my master.
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
I say, sing.
Forbear till this company be past.
I do betray myself with blushing.
Maid!
Man.
I will visit thee at the lodge.
That's hereby.
I know where it is situate.
Lord, how wise you are!
I will tell thee wonders.
With that face?
I love thee.
So I heard you say.
And so, farewell.
Fair weather after you!
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned.
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a full stomach.
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.
Take away this villain; shut him up.
Come, you transgressing slave; away!
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.
What shall some see?
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
Proud of employment, willingly I go.
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Who are the votaries, my loving lords, That are vow fellows with this virtuous Duke?
Lord Longaville is one.
Know you the man?
They say so most that most his humours know.
Such short lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?
Another of these students at that time Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
God bless my ladies!
are they all in love, That every one her own hath garnished With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
Here comes Boyet.
Now, what admittance, lord?
Navarre had notice of your fair approach; And he and his competitors in oath Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady, Before I came.
Marry, thus much I have learnt: He rather means to lodge you in the field, Like one that comes here to besiege his court, Than seek a dispensation for his oath, To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
Our Lady help my lord!
he'll be forsworn.
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise, Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
I know you did.
How needless was it then to ask the question!
You must not be so quick.
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
What time o' day?
The hour that fools should ask.
Now fair befall your mask!
Fair fall the face it covers!
And send you many lovers!
Amen, so you be none.
Nay, then will I be gone.
Madam, your father here doth intimate The payment of a hundred thousand crowns; Being but the one half of an entire sum Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have, Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which, One part of Aquitaine is bound to us, Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore But that one half which is unsatisfied, We will give up our right in Aquitaine, And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
You do the king my father too much wrong And wrong the reputation of your name, In so unseeming to confess receipt Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances For such a sum from special officers Of Charles his father.
Satisfy me so.
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
I would you heard it groan.
Is the fool sick?
Sick at the heart.
Alack, let it blood.
Would that do it good?
My physic says 'ay.  '
Will you prick't with your eye?
No point, with my knife.
Now, God save thy life!
And yours from long living!
I cannot stay thanksgiving.
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
A gallant lady.
Monsieur, fare you well.
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
Perchance light in the light.
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
Her mother's, I have heard.
God's blessing on your beard!
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.
Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.
Not unlike, sir, that may be.
What's her name in the cap?
Rosaline, by good hap.
Is she wedded or no?
To her will, sir, or so.
You are welcome, sir: adieu.
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord: Not a word with him but a jest.
And every jest but a word.
It was well done of you to take him at his word.
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
Two hot sheeps, marry.
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
Belonging to whom?
To my fortunes and me.
If my observation, which very seldom lies, By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes, Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
With what?
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
Your reason?
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
Thou art an old love monger and speakest skilfully.
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
No.
What then, do you see?
Ay, our way to be gone.
You are too hard for me.
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
Concolinel.
Sweet air!
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
How meanest thou?
brawling in French?
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse like o'er the shop of your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away .
These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of note  do you note me?
How hast thou purchased this experience?
By my penny of observation.
But O,  but O,
Callest thou my love 'hobby horse'?
Almost I had.
Negligent student!
learn her by heart.
By heart and in heart, boy.
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
What wilt thou prove?
I am all these three.
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador for an ass.
Ha, ha!
what sayest thou?
The way is but short: away!
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
I say lead is slow.
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
Thump then and I flee.
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
A wonder, master!
here's a costard broken in a shin.
No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain!
no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
Do the wise think them other?
is not l'envoy a salve?
I will add the l'envoy.
Say the moral again.
The fox, the ape, and the humble bee, Were still at odds, being but three.
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you desire more?
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
Come hither, come hither.
How did this argument begin?
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
I will tell you sensibly.
We will talk no more of this matter.
Till there be more matter in the shin.
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy, some goose, in this.
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.
True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
Like the sequel, I.   Signior Costard, adieu.
My sweet ounce of man's flesh!
my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration.
Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three farthings  remuneration.
'What's the price of this inkle?'
'One penny.  '
'No, I'll give you a remuneration:' why, it carries it.
Remuneration!
O, my good knave Costard!
exceedingly well met.
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?
What is a remuneration?
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
Why, then, three farthing worth of silk.
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
When would you have it done, sir?
This afternoon.
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
Thou knowest not what it is.
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
Why, villain, thou must know first.
I will come to your worship to morrow morning.
It must be done this afternoon.
Gardon, O sweet gardon!
better than remuneration, a'leven pence farthing better: most sweet gardon!
I will do it sir, in print.
And I, forsooth, in love!
Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard Against the steep uprising of the hill?
I know not; but I think it was not he.
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to day we shall have our dispatch: On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush That we must stand and play the murderer in?
I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot, And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
What, what?
first praise me and again say no?
O short lived pride!
Not fair?
alack for woe!
Yes, madam, fair.
Nay, never paint me now: Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true: Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
Do not curst wives hold that self sovereignty Only for praise sake, when they strive to be Lords o'er their lords?
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
God dig you den all!
Pray you, which is the head lady?
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
The thickest and the tallest.
The thickest and the tallest!
it is so; truth is truth.
What's your will, sir?
what's your will?
I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
O, thy letter, thy letter!
he's a good friend of mine: Stand aside, good bearer.
Boyet, you can carve; Break up this capon.
I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here; It is writ to Jaquenetta.
We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible; true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that thou art lovely.
What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
I am much deceived but I remember the style.
Thou fellow, a word: Who gave thee this letter?
I told you; my lord.
To whom shouldst thou give it?
From my lord to my lady.
From which lord to which lady?
Thou hast mistaken his letter.
Come, lords, away.
Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
Who is the suitor?
who is the suitor?
Shall I teach you to know?
Ay, my continent of beauty.
Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!
My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry, Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!
Well, then, I am the shooter.
And who is your deer?
You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow.
But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as touching the hit it?
If I cannot, if I cannot, Then I'm sure another can.
A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
A mark!
O, mark but that mark!
A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
Wide o' the bow hand!
i' faith, your hand is out.
Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
I fear too much rubbing.
Good night, my good owl.
By my soul, a swain!
a most simple clown!
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O' my troth, most sweet jests!
most incony vulgar wit!
Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony of a good conscience.
Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
'Twas not an 'auld grey doe', 'twas a pricket.
Most barbarous intimation!
I said the deer was not an 'auld grey doe', twas a pricket.
Twice sod simplicity, his coctus!
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
You two are book men: can you tell me by your wit What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five weeks old as yet?
Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
What is Dictynna?
A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more, And raught not to five weeks when he came to five score.
The allusion holds in the exchange.
'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
God comfort thy capacity!
I say, the allusion holds in the exchange.
Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer?
And, to humour the ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a
Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility.
I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
A rare talent!
If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.
Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall want no instruction; if their daughters be capable, I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
God give you good morrow, master Person.
Master Parson, quasi pers on.
An if one should be pierced, which is the one?
Piercing a hogshead!
a good lustre of conceit in a tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
Ay, sir, and very learned.
Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange queen's lords.
I will overglance the superscript: 'To the snow white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.  '
I will look again on the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all desired employment, BIRON.  '
Good Costard, go with me.
Sir, God save your life!
Have with thee, my girl.
Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a certain father saith,
Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable colours.
But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?
Marvellous well for the pen.
And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not say me nay: pauca verba.
Away!
Ay me!
Shot, by heaven!
Proceed, sweet Cupid: thou hast thumped him with thy bird bolt under the left pap.
In faith, secrets!
What, Longaville!
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
Ay me, I am forsworn!
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
One drunkard loves another of the name.
Am I the first that have been perjured so?
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move: O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
This same shall go.
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye, 'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument, Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee: My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love; Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
This is the liver vein, which makes flesh a deity, A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend!
we are much out o' the way.
By whom shall I send this?
Company!
stay.
Dumain transform'd!
four woodcocks in a dish!
O most divine Kate!
O most profane coxcomb!
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
An amber colour'd raven was well noted.
As upright as the cedar.
Stoop, I say; Her shoulder is with child.
As fair as day.
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
O that I had my wish!
And I had mine!
And I mine too, good Lord!
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
I would forget her; but a fever she Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
On a day  alack the day!
You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn!
how will he spend his wit!
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over view?
Soft!
whither away so fast?
I post from love: good lover, let me go.
God bless the King!
What present hast thou there?
Some certain treason.
What makes treason here?
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
If it mar nothing neither, The treason and you go in peace away together.
Biron, read it over.
Where hadst thou it?
Of Costard.
Where hadst thou it?
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
How now!
what is in you?
why dost thou tear it?
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
Ah, you whoreson loggerhead!
you were born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty!
I confess, I confess.
What?
Now the number is even.
True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?
Hence, sirs; away!
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
Did they, quoth you?
Who sees the heavenly Rosaline, That, like a rude and savage man of Inde, At the first opening of the gorgeous east, Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle sighted eye Dares look upon the heaven of her brow, That is not blinded by her majesty?
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron: O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
Is ebony like her?
O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath?
where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, If that she learn not of her eye to look: No face is fair that is not full so black.
O paradox!
Black is the badge of hell, The hue of dungeons and the school of night; And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd, It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect; And therefore is she born to make black fair.
To look like her are chimney sweepers black.
And since her time are colliers counted bright.
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain, I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to day.
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes, Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
O, vile!
then, as she goes, what upward lies The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
But what of this?
are we not all in love?
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
Some salve for perjury.
'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto, To fast, to study, and to see no woman; Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast?
your stomachs are too young; And abstinence engenders maladies.
Saint Cupid, then!
and, soldiers, to the field!
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords; Pell mell, down with them!
Away, away!
no time shall be omitted That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
Allons!
allons!
Satis quod sufficit.
A most singular and choice epithet.
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument.
Laus Deo, bone intelligo.
Bon, bon, for bene!
Priscian a little scratch'd, 'twill serve.
Videsne quis venit?
Video, et gaudeo.
Chirrah!
Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
Men of peace, well encountered.
Most military sir, salutation.
Peace!
Monsieur, are you not lettered?
Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook.
What is a, b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
Ba, most silly sheep with a horn.
You hear his learning.
Quis, quis, thou consonant?
The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or the fifth, if I.
I will repeat them,  a, e, i,
The sheep: the other two concludes it,  o, u.
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch, a quick venue of wit!
snip, snap, quick and home!
it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit old.
What is the figure?
what is the figure?
Horns.
Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
Arts man, preambulate, we will be singled from the barbarous.
Or mons, the hill.
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
I do, sans question.
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the rude multitude call the afternoon.
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is inward between us, let it pass.
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
Joshua, yourself; this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules,
Shall I have audience?
An excellent device!
so, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules!
now thou crushest the snake!  '
For the rest of the Worthies?
I will play three myself.
Thrice worthy gentleman!
Shall I tell you a thing?
We attend.
We will have, if this fadge not, an antic.
I beseech you, follow.
Via, goodman Dull!
thou hast spoken no word all this while.
Nor understood none neither, sir.
Allons!
we will employ thee.
I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
Most dull, honest Dull!
To our sport, away!
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart, If fairings come thus plentifully in: A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.
Madame, came nothing else along with that?
Nothing but this!
That was the way to make his godhead wax, For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
A light condition in a beauty dark.
We need more light to find your meaning out.
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff; Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
So do not you, for you are a light wench.
You weigh me not?
O, that's you care not for me.
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.  '
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But Rosaline, you have a favour too: Who sent it?
and what is it?
Any thing like?
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
Fair as a text B in a copy book.
'Ware pencils, ho!
A pox of that jest!
and I beshrew all shrows.
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
Madam, this glove.
Did he not send you twain?
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville: The letter is too long by half a mile.
I think no less.
Dost thou not wish in heart The chain were longer and the letter short?
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go: O that I knew he were but in by the week!
The blood of youth burns not with such excess As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
O, I am stabb'd with laughter!
Where's her grace?
Thy news Boyet?
Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm!
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid!
What are they That charge their breath against us?
say, scout, say.
Under the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour; When, lo!
to interrupt my purposed rest, Toward that shade I might behold addrest The king and his companions: warily I stole into a neighbour thicket by, And overheard what you shall overhear, That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
But what, but what, come they to visit us?
They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
And will they so?
Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
But in this changing what is your intent?
But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart, And quite divorce his memory from his part.
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
That ever turn'd their  backs  to mortal views!
Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
Out
True; out indeed.
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe Not to behold
Once to behold, rogue.
Once to behold with your sun beamed eyes,   with your sun beamed eyes
They will not answer to that epithet; You were best call it 'daughter beamed eyes.  '
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
Is this your perfectness?
be gone, you rogue!
What would these strangers?
What would you with the Princess?
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
What would they, say they?
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
Say to her, we have measured many miles To tread a measure with her on this grass.
They say, that they have measured many a mile To tread a measure with you on this grass.
It is not so.
If to come hither you have measured miles, And many miles, the princess bids you tell How many inches doth fill up one mile.
Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
She hears herself.
How many weary steps, Of many weary miles you have o'ergone, Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine, Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
O vain petitioner!
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
Play, music, then!
Nay, you must do it soon.
Not yet!
no dance!
Thus change I like the moon.
Will you not dance?
How come you thus estranged?
You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
Our ears vouchsafe it.
But your legs should do it.
Since you are strangers and come here by chance, We'll not be nice: take hands.
We will not dance.
Why take we hands, then?
Only to part friends: Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
More measure of this measure; be not nice.
We can afford no more at such a price.
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
Your absence only.
That can never be.
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
In private, then.
I am best pleased with that.
White handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice, Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half a dozen sweets.
One word in secret.
Let it not be sweet.
Thou grievest my gall.
Gall!
bitter.
Therefore meet.
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
Name it.
Fair lady,
Say you so?
Fair lord,   Take that for your fair lady.
Please it you, As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
O for your reason!
quickly, sir; I long.
You have a double tongue within your mask, And would afford my speechless vizard half.
Veal, quoth the Dutchman.
Is not "veal" a calf?
A calf, fair lady!
No, a fair lord calf.
Let's part the word.
Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady?
do not so.
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
One word in private with you, ere I die.
Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
By heaven, all dry beaten with pure scoff!
Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
Well liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
O poverty in wit, kingly poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping ripe for a good word.
Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart; And trow you what he called me?
Qualm, perhaps.
Yes, in good faith.
Go, sickness as thou art!
Well, better wits have worn plain statute caps.
But will you hear?
the king is my love sworn.
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
And Longaville was for my service born.
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
Will they return?
How blow?
how blow?
speak to be understood.
Avaunt, perplexity!
What shall we do, If they return in their own shapes to woo?
Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
Fair sir, God save you!
Where's the princess?
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart, That put Armado's page out of his part!
See where it comes!
Behavior, what wert thou Till this madman show'd thee?
and what art thou now?
The PRINCESS re enters, led on by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA and KATHARINE.
Hail, my sweet madam, and a good day to you!
To call a hailstorm fair is an offense, I think.
Interpret my speeches better, if you can.
If you want me to be better than I am, then I'll just leave.
We came to visit you and now would like to take you to our court.
I will stay in this field, so that you can stay true to your vow.
Don't judge me for something which you have made me do.
Yes, truthfully my lord.
Madam, tell the truth, that was not the case, my lord.
This joke is not amusing to me.
Then you must be wise and rich, for in my mind
But that you take what doth to you belong, It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
All the fool mine?
I cannot give you less.
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
Where?
when?
what vizard?
why demand you this?
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
Amazed, my lord?
why looks your highness sad?
Help, hold his brows!
he'll swoon!
Why look you pale?
Sea sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Sans sans, I pray you.
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
Peace!
for I will not have to do with you.
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression Some fair excuse.
The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?
Madam, I was.
And were you well advised?
I was, fair madam.
When you then were here, What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
That more than all the world I did respect her.
When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
Upon mine honour, no.
Peace, peace!
Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
I will: and therefore keep it.
Rosaline, What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear As precious eyesight, and did value me Above this world; adding thereto moreover That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
God give thee joy of him!
the noble lord Most honourably doth unhold his word.
What mean you, madam?
by my life, my troth, I never swore this lady such an oath.
By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain, You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
Neither of either; I remit both twain.
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
Full merrily Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
Lo, he is tilting straight!
Peace!
I have done.
Welcome, pure wit!
thou partest a fair fray.
O Lord, sir, they would know Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
What, are there but three?
No, sir; but it is vara fine, For every one pursents three.
And three times thrice is nine.
Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know what we know: I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,
Is not nine.
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir.
How much is it?
Art thou one of the Worthies?
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
Go, bid them prepare.
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.
Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
We are shame proof, my lord: and tis some policy To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
I say they shall not come.
A right description of our sport, my lord.
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
Doth this man serve God?
Why ask you?
He speaks not like a man of God's making.
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies.
He presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
There is five in the first show.
You are deceived; 'tis not so.
The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
I Pompey am,
You lie, you are not he.
I Pompey am,
With leopard's head on knee.
Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends with thee.
I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big
The Great.
Great thanks, great Pompey.
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I made a little fault in 'Great.  '
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender smelling knight.
The conqueror is dismay'd.
Proceed, good Alexander.
When in the world I lived, I was the world's commander,
Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
Pompey the Great,
Your servant, and Costard.
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
O, sir, you have overthrown Alisander the conqueror!
Judas I am,
A Judas!
Not Iscariot, sir.
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
A kissing traitor.
How art thou proved Judas?
Judas I am,
The more shame for you, Judas.
What mean you, sir?
To make Judas hang himself.
Begin, sir; you are my elder.
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
I will not be put out of countenance.
Because thou hast no face.
What is this?
A cittern head.
The head of a bodkin.
A Death's face in a ring.
The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
The carved bone face on a flask.
Saint George's half cheek in a brooch.
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
You have put me out of countenance.
False; we have given thee faces.
But you have out faced them all.
An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude!
nay, why dost thou stay?
For the latter end of his name.
For the ass to the Jude; give it him:  Jud as, away!
This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
A light for Monsieur Judas!
it grows dark, he may stumble.
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
But is this Hector?
I think Hector was not so clean timbered.
His leg is too big for Hector's.
More calf, certain.
No; he is best endued in the small.
This cannot be Hector.
He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, Gave Hector a gift,
A lemon.
Stuck with cloves.
No, cloven.
Peace!
That mint.
That columbine.
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
The sweet war man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed, he was a man.
But I will forward with my device.
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
Loves her by the foot,
He may not by the yard.
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,
What meanest thou?
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in her belly already: tis yours.
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates?
thou shalt die.
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by him.
Most rare Pompey!
Renowned Pompey!
Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
Pompey the Huge!
Hector trembles.
Pompey is moved.
More Ates, more Ates!
stir them on!
Hector will challenge him.
Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will sup a flea.
By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man: I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword.
I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again.
Room for the incensed Worthies!
I'll do it in my shirt.
Most resolute Pompey!
Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower.
Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat?
What mean you?
You will lose your reputation.
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
What reason have you for't?
The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go woolward for penance.
God save you, madam!
Welcome, Mercade; But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring Is heavy in my tongue.
The king your father
Dead, for my life!
Even so; my tale is told.
Worthies, away!
the scene begins to cloud.
For mine own part, I breathe free breath.
I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
How fares your majesty?
Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
Prepare, I say.
I understand you not: my griefs are double.
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
So did our looks.
We did not quote them so.
Now, at the latest minute of the hour, Grant us your loves.
A time, methinks, too short To make a world without end bargain in.
But what to me, my love?
but what to me?
A wife?
O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
What says Maria?
At the twelvemonth's end I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
The liker you; few taller are so young.
Studies my lady?
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible: Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
A twelvemonth!
well; befall what will befall, I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day, And then 'twill end.
That's too long for a play.
Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,
Was not that Hector?
The worthy knight of Troy.
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave.
Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
Holla!
approach.
SPRING.
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo.
You that way: we this way.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When the hurly burly’s done, When the battle’s lost and won.
That will be ere the set of sun.
Where the place?
Upon the heath.
There to meet with Macbeth.
I come, Graymalkin!
Paddock calls.
Anon.
Fair is foul, and foul is fair Hover through the fog and filthy air.
What bloody man is that?
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought ‘Gainst my captivity.
Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it.
O valiant cousin!
Worthy gentleman!
As whence the sun ‘gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come Discomfort swells.
Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.
Go get him surgeons.
Who comes here?
The worthy thane of Ross.
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look That seems to speak things strange.
God save the king.
Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?
From Fife, great king, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold.
Great happiness!
That now Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition.
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
I’ll see it done.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
Where hast thou been, sister?
Killing swine.
Sister, where thou?
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munched, and munched, and munched.
“Give me,” quoth I.
“Aroint thee, witch!
” the rump fed runnion cries.
Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger; But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,
I’ll give thee a wind.
Thou ‘rt kind.
And I another.
I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow, All the quarters that they know I’ th’ shipman’s card.
Show me, show me.
Here I have a pilot’s thumb, Wrecked as homeward he did come.
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
How far is ’t called to Forres?
Speak, if you can: what are you?
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Lesser than Macbeth and greater.
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor?
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them.
Whither are they vanished?
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
To the selfsame tune and words.
Who’s here?
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks, Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee.
And, for an earnest of a greater honor, He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: In which addition, hail, most worthy thane, For it is thine.
What, can the devil speak true?
The thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes?
Who was the thane lives yet, But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose.
Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them?
That, trusted home, Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the thane of Cawdor.
But ’tis strange.
Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme.
I thank you, gentlemen.
Look how our partner’s rapt.
New honors come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold But with the aid of use.
Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Give me your favor.
My dull brain was wrought With things forgotten.
Kind gentlemen, your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them.
Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time, The interim having weighed it, let us speak Our free hearts each to other.
Very gladly.
Till then, enough.
Come, friends.
Is execution done on Cawdor?
Are not Those in commission yet returned?
My liege, They are not yet come back.
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.
He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust.
The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself.
Welcome hither.
There, if I grow, The harvest is your own.
My plenteous joys, Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow.
My worthy Cawdor!
The prince of Cumberland!
That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o’erleap, For in my way it lies.
Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.
True, worthy Banquo.
“They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, who all hailed me ‘Thane of Cawdor,’ by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!
’ This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.
” Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promised.
What is your tidings?
The king comes here tonight.
Thou ‘rt mad to say it.
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.
Give him tending.
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top full Of direst cruelty.
Make thick my blood.
Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it!
Come to my woman’s breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief.
Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry “Hold, hold!
”
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.
And when goes hence?
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
O, never Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters.
To beguile the time, Look like the time.
Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue.
Look like th’ innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t.
We will speak further.
Only look up clear.
To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.
This castle hath a pleasant seat.
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
This guest of summer, The temple haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here.
No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.
See, see, our honored hostess!
All our service, In every point twice done and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house.
Where’s the thane of Cawdor?
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him.
How now!
He has almost supped.
Why have you left the chamber?
Hath he asked for me?
Know you not he has?
We will proceed no further in this business.
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself?
What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me?
If we should fail?
We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking place, And we’ll not fail.
Bring forth men children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males.
Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done ’t?
I am settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
How goes the night, boy?
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.
And she goes down at twelve.
I take ’t ’tis later, sir.
Hold, take my sword.
There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose.
Give me my sword.
Who’s there?
A friend.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king’s a bed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content.
Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.
All’s well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.
I think not of them.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.
At your kind’st leisure.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.
So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counselled.
Good repose the while!
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat oppressèd brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses, Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before.
There’s no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes.
Now o’er the one half world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep.
I go, and it is done.
The bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
Hark!
Peace!
Who’s there?
What, ho!
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked, And ’tis not done.
Th’ attempt and not the deed Confounds us.
Hark!
I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss ‘em.
Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done ’t.
My husband!
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
When?
Now.
As I descended?
Ay.
Hark!
Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?
Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried.
There are two lodged together.
One cried, “God bless us!
” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
List’ning their fear I could not say “Amen,” When they did say “God bless us!
”
Consider it not so deeply.
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen?” I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat.
These deeds must not be thought After these ways.
So, it will make us mad.
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
What do you mean?
Still it cried, “Sleep no more!
” to all the house.
“Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more.
”
Who was it that thus cried?
Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things.
Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
Whence is that knocking?
How is ’t with me when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
Ha!
They pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red.
My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white.
I hear a knocking At the south entry.
Retire we to our chamber.
A little water clears us of this deed.
How easy is it, then!
Your constancy Hath left you unattended.
Hark!
More knocking.
To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
I would thou couldst.
Here’s a knocking indeed!
Knock, knock, knock!
Who’s there, i’ th’ name of Beelzebub?
Knock, knock!
Who’s there, in th’ other devil’s name?
Knock, knock, knock!
Who’s there?
Knock, knock!
Never at quiet.
What are you?
But this place is too cold for hell.
I’ll devil porter it no further.
I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.
Anon, anon!
I pray you, remember the porter.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?
‘Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock.
And drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Marry, sir, nose painting, sleep, and urine.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.
It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.
Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
Is thy master stirring?
Our knocking has awaked him.
Here he comes.
Good morrow, noble sir.
Good morrow, both.
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
Not yet.
He did command me to call timely on him.
I have almost slipped the hour.
I’ll bring you to him.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you, But yet ’tis one.
The labor we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
I’ll make so bold to call, For ’tis my limited service.
Goes the king hence today?
He does.
He did appoint so.
The night has been unruly.
‘Twas a rough night.
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence The life o’ th’ building!
What is ’t you say?
“The life?”
Mean you his majesty?
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum bell.
Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain!
Malcolm!
Awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit, And look on death itself!
Up, up, and see The great doom’s image!
Malcolm!
Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!
Ring the bell.
What’s the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house?
Speak, speak!
O gentle lady, ‘Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman’s ear,
O Banquo, Banquo, Our royal master’s murdered!
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.
What is amiss?
You are, and do not know ’t.
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.
Your royal father’s murdered.
Oh, by whom?
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows.
They stared, and were distracted.
No man’s life was to be trusted with them.
Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.
Wherefore did you so?
Who can be wise, amazed, temp’rate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment?
No man.
Help me hence, ho!
Look to the lady.
What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?
Let’s away.
Our tears are not yet brewed.
Look to the lady.
And when we have our naked frailties hid, That suffer in exposure, let us meet And question this most bloody piece of work, To know it further.
Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice.
And so do I.
So all.
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i’ th’ hall together.
Well contented.
What will you do?
Let’s not consort with them.
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy.
I’ll to England.
To Ireland, I.
Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer.
Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles.
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore, to horse, And let us not be dainty of leave taking, But shift away.
‘Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that’s done.
‘Tis said they eat each other.
How goes the world, sir, now?
Why, see you not?
Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed?
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?
They were suborned.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, Are stol’n away and fled, which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.
‘Gainst nature still!
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested.
Where is Duncan’s body?
Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.
Will you to Scone?
No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.
Well, I will thither.
Well, may you see things well done there.
Farewell, father.
God’s benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the weird women promised, and I fear Thou played’st most foully for ’t.
Here’s our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all thing unbecoming.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I’ll request your presence.
Let your highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit.
Ride you this afternoon?
Ay, my good lord.
We should have else desired your good advice  Which still hath been both grave and prosperous  In this day’s council, but we’ll take tomorrow.
Is ’t far you ride?
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time ‘Twixt this and supper.
Go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain.
Fail not our feast.
My lord, I will not.
Ay, my good lord.
Our time does call upon ’s.
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night.
To make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone.
While then, God be with you!
Sirrah, a word with you.
Attend those men Our pleasure?
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared.
‘Tis much he dares, And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety.
Now go to the door and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
It was, so please your highness.
Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches?
You made it known to us.
We are men, my liege.
I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
And I another So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on ’t.
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.
True, my lord.
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life.
We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.
Though our lives
Your spirits shine through you.
We are resolved, my lord.
I’ll call upon you straight.
Abide within.
It is concluded.
Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.
Is Banquo gone from court?
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words.
Madam, I will.
How now, my lord!
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy.
Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek o’er your rugged looks.
Be bright and jovial Among your guests tonight.
So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you.
Let your remembrance
You must leave this.
But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.
There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
What’s to be done?
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.
But who did bid thee join with us?
Macbeth.
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just.
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn, and near approaches The subject of our watch.
Hark, I hear horses.
Give us a light there, ho!
His horses go about.
A light, a light!
‘Tis he.
Stand to ’t.
It will be rain tonight.
Let it come down.
O treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou may ’st revenge  O slave!
Who did strike out the light?
Was ’t not the way?
There’s but one down.
The son is fled.
We have lost best half of our affair.
Well, let’s away and say how much is done.
Thanks to your majesty.
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host.
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart speaks they are welcome.
See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.
Both sides are even.
Here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.
Be large in mirth.
Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round.
There’s blood upon thy face.
‘Tis Banquo’s then.
My lord, his throat is cut.
That I did for him.
Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air.
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears.
But Banquo’s safe?
Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head, The least a death to nature.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies.
My royal lord, You do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold That is not often vouched, while ’tis a making, ‘Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!
May ’t please your highness sit.
His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise.
Please ’t your highness To grace us with your royal company?
The table’s full.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
Where?
Here, my good lord.
What is ’t that moves your highness?
Which of you have done this?
What, my good lord?
Thou canst not say I did it.
Never shake Thy gory locks at me.
Gentlemen, rise.
His highness is not well.
Sit, worthy friends.
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth.
Pray you, keep seat.
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appall the devil.
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear.
This is the air drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.
Prithee, see there!
Behold!
Look!
Lo!
How say you?
Why, what care I?
If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.
What, quite unmanned in folly?
If I stand here, I saw him.
Fie, for shame!
My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.
I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me.
Come, love and health to all.
Then I’ll sit down.
Give me some wine.
Fill full.
I drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; Would he were here!
To all and him we thirst, And all to all.
Our duties, and the pledge.
Avaunt, and quit my sight!
Let the earth hide thee.
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with!
Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom.
What man dare, I dare.
Why so, being gone, I am a man again.
Pray you sit still.
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.
Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer’s cloud, Without our special wonder?
You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine is blanched with fear.
What sights, my lord?
I pray you, speak not.
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once.
Good night, and better health Attend his majesty!
A kind good night to all!
It will have blood, they say.
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
Did you send to him, sir?
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d.
I will tomorrow  And betimes I will to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good, All causes shall give way.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
Come, we’ll to sleep.
My strange and self abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.
Why, how now, Hecate!
You look angerly.
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Hark!
I am called.
My little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.
Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.
Sent he to Macduff?
And that well might Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance His wisdom can provide.
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed!
I’ll send my prayers with him.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
Thrice, and once the hedge pig whined.
Harpier cries, “‘Tis time, ’tis time.
”
Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty one Sweltered venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i’ th’ charmèd pot.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witches’ mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravined salt sea shark, Root of hemlock digged i’ th’ dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat and slips of yew Slivered in the moon’s eclipse, Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips, Finger of birth strangled babe Ditch delivered by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Cool it with a baboon’s blood, Then the charm is firm and good.
Oh well done!
I commend your pains, And every one shall share i’ th’ gains .
And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in.
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks, Whoever knocks.
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is ’t you do?
A deed without a name.
I conjure you by that which you profess  Howe’er you come to know it answer me.
Speak.
Demand.
We’ll answer.
Say, if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters’.
Call ‘em.
Let me see ‘em.
Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show!
Tell me, thou unknown power
He knows thy thought.
Hear his speech but say thou nought.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Dismiss me.
Enough.
Whate’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
But one word more
He will not be commanded.
Here’s another More potent than the first.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Had I three ears, I’d hear thee.
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.
Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth.
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?
But yet I’ll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate.
Thou shalt not live, That I may tell pale hearted fear it lies, And sleep in spite of thunder.
What is this That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty?
Listen but speak not to ’t.
That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root?
Sweet bodements!
Good!
Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.
Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing.
Tell me, if your art Can tell so much: shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom?
Seek to know no more.
I will be satisfied.
Deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you!
Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron?
And what noise is this?
Show.
Show.
Show.
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
Come like shadows; so depart!
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
And thy hair, Thou other gold bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.
Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this?
A fourth?
Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?
Another yet?
A seventh?
I’ll see no more.
What, is this so?
Ay, sir, all this is so.
But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, And show the best of our delights.
I’ll charm th’ air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round.
That this great king may kindly say, Our duties did his welcome pay.
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar!
Come in, without there.
What’s your grace’s will?
Saw you the weird sisters?
No, my lord.
Came they not by you?
No, indeed, my lord.
‘Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.
Fled to England?
Ay, my good lord.
Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o’ertook Unless the deed go with it.
From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand.
What had he done to make him fly the land?
You must have patience, madam.
He had none.
His flight was madness.
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Wisdom!
To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly?
He loves us not; He wants the natural touch.
My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself.
But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o’ th’ season.
I dare not speak much further; But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and none.
Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.
Sirrah, your father’s dead.
And what will you do now?
How will you live?
As birds do, Mother.
What, with worms and flies?
With what I get, I mean, and so do they.
Poor bird!
Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime, The pitfall nor the gin.
Why should I, mother?
Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
Yes, he is dead.
How wilt thou do for a father?
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Then you’ll buy ‘em to sell again.
Thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet, i’ faith, With wit enough for thee.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
Ay, that he was.
What is a traitor?
Why, one that swears and lies.
And be all traitors that do so?
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Every one.
Who must hang them?
Why, the honest men.
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them.
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt thou do for a father?
If he were dead, you’d weep for him.
If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!
Bless you, fair dame!
I am not to you known, Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here.
Hence with your little ones.
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm.
But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly.
Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defense, To say I have done no harm?
What are these faces?
Where is your husband?
I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him.
He’s a traitor.
Thou liest, thou shag ear’d villain!
What, you egg?
Young fry of treachery!
He has killed me, mother.
Run away, I pray you!
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men, Bestride our downfall’n birthdom.
I am not treacherous.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge.
But I shall crave your pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so.
I have lost my hopes.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee.
Wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeered.
Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp, And the rich East to boot.
Be not offended.
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds.
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands.
What should he be?
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth.
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny.
It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings.
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours.
You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold; the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough.
This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings.
But I have none.
O Scotland, Scotland!
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.
O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody sceptered, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed, And does blaspheme his breed?
Thy royal father Was a most sainted king.
The queen that bore thee, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived.
Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Have banished me from Scotland.
O my breast,
Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ‘Tis hard to reconcile.
Well, more anon.
Comes the king forth, I pray you?
I thank you, doctor.
What’s the disease he means?
‘Tis called the evil.
A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often since my here remain in England I have seen him do.
See, who comes here?
My countryman, but yet I know him not.
My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.
I know him now.
Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers!
Sir, amen.
Stands Scotland where it did?
Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself.
Oh, relation Too nice and yet too true!
What’s the newest grief?
That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker.
Each minute teems a new one.
How does my wife?
Why, well.
And all my children?
Well too.
The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
No, they were well at peace when I did leave ‘em.
Be not a niggard of your speech.
How goes ’t?
Be ’t their comfort We are coming thither.
Would I could answer This comfort with the like.
But I have words That would be howled out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them.
What concern they?
The general cause, or is it a fee grief Due to some single breast?
No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.
If it be mine, Keep it not from me.
Quickly let me have it.
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.
Hum!
I guess at it.
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered.
Merciful heaven!
What, man!
Ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
And I must be from thence!
My wife killed too?
I have said.
Be comforted.
Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did you say all?
O hell kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop?
Dispute it like a man.
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief Convert to anger.
Blunt not the heart, enrage it.
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue!
But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission.
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king.
Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments.
Receive what cheer you may.
The night is long that never finds the day.
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should.
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.
Lo you, here she comes.
This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep.
Observe her, stand close.
How came she by that light?
Why, it stood by her.
She has light by her continually.
‘Tis her command.
You see her eyes are open.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
What is it she does now?
Look, how she rubs her hands.
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands.
I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
Yet here’s a spot.
Hark!
She speaks.
I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
Out, damned spot!
Out, I say!
One, two.
Why, then, ’tis time to do ’t.
Hell is murky!
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier, and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.
Do you mark that?
The thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is she now?
What, will these hands ne’er be clean?
No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that.
You mar all with this starting.
Go to, go to.
You have known what you should not.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
Here’s the smell of the blood still.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, Oh, Oh!
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
Well, well, well.
Pray God it be, sir.
This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
Wash your hands.
Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale.
Even so?
To bed, to bed.
There’s knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, come.
Give me your hand.
What’s done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed!
Will she go now to bed?
Directly.
Foul whisp’rings are abroad.
Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles.
Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all!
Good night, good doctor.
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
For certain, sir, he is not.
I have a file Of all the gentry.
What does the tyrant?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach.
Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love.
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?
Well, march we on, To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, And with him pour we in our country’s purge Each drop of us.
Or so much as it needs, To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly all.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear.
What’s the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth.
No man that’s born of woman Shall e’er have power upon thee.
” Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures.
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
The devil damn thee black, thou cream faced loon!
Where got’st thou that goose look?
There is ten thousand
Geese, villain?
Soldiers, sir.
Go, prick thy face and over red thy fear, Thou lily livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul!
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear.
What soldiers, whey face?
The English force, so please you.
Take thy face hence.
Seyton!
I am sick at heart, When I behold Seyton, I say!
This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
What’s your gracious pleasure?
What news more?
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armor.
‘Tis not needed yet.
I’ll put it on.
Send out more horses.
Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear.
Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick coming fancies
Cure her of that.
Therein the patient Must minister to himself.
Throw physic to the dogs; I’ll none of it.
Come, put mine armor on.
Give me my staff.
Seyton, send out.
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch.
Ay, my good lord.
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.
We doubt it nothing.
What wood is this before us?
The wood of Birnam.
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him.
It shall be done.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t.
Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership.
The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still “They come!
” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.
What is that noise?
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
Wherefore was that cry?
The queen, my lord, is dead.
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Thou comest to use Thy tongue; thy story quickly.
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t.
Well, say, sir.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought The wood began to move.
Liar and slave!
Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.
If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee.
If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution and begin To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth.
Now near enough.
Your leafy screens throw down, And show like those you are.
You, worthy uncle, Shall, with my cousin, your right noble son, Lead our first battle.
Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do, According to our order.
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
They have tied me to a stake.
What is thy name?
Thou ‘lt be afraid to hear it.
No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell.
My name’s Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.
No, nor more fearful.
Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant.
With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.
That way the noise is.
Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine, My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
This way, my lord.
The castle’s gently rendered.
We have met with foes That strike beside us.
Enter, sir, the castle.
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword?
Whiles I see lives, the gashes Do better upon them.
Turn, hellhound, turn!
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back.
My soul is too much charged With blood of thine already.
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword.
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!
Thou losest labor.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cowed my better part of man!
Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.
”
I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last.
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.
Lay on, Macduff, And damned be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!
”
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
Some must go off.
And yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.
He only lived but till he was a man, The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died.
Then he is dead?
Ay, and brought off the field.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.
Had he his hurts before?
Ay, on the front.
Why then, God’s soldier be he!
He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him.
He’s worth no more.
They say he parted well and paid his score.
And so, God be with him!
Here comes newer comfort.
Hail, king!
For so thou art.
Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head.
The time is free.
I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds, Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
Hail, King of Scotland!
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you.
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.
Escalus.
My lord.
If any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour, It is Lord Angelo.
Look where he comes.
Always obedient to your grace's will, I come to know your pleasure.
Angelo, There is a kind of character in thy life, That to the observer doth thy history Fully unfold.
Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Now, good my lord, Let there be some more test made of my metal, Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamp'd upon it.
Yet give leave, my lord, That we may bring you something on the way.
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
I thank you.
Fare you well.
'Tis so with me.
Let us withdraw together, And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that point.
I'll wait upon your honour.
If the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the king.
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary's!
Amen.
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped one out of the table.
"Thou shalt not steal?"
Ay, that he razed.
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.
No?
a dozen times at least.
What, in metre?
In any proportion or in any language.
I think, or in any religion.
Ay, why not?
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
Thou art the list.
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
Behold, behold.
To what, I pray?
Judge.
To three thousand dolours a year.
Ay, and more.
A French crown more.
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou art full of error; I am sound.
How now!
which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
Who's that, I pray thee?
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
Claudio to prison?
'tis not so.
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
Away!
let's go learn the truth of it.
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows and what with poverty, I am custom shrunk.
Yonder man is carried to prison.
Well; what has he done?
A woman.
But what's his offence?
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
What, is there a maid with child by him?
No, but there's a woman with maid by him.
You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?
What proclamation, man?
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
And what shall become of those in the city?
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?
To the ground, mistress.
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?
What's to do here, Thomas tapster?
let's withdraw.
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison; and there's Madam JULIET.
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
I do it not in evil disposition, But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
Why, how now, Claudio!
whence comes this restraint?
What but to speak of would offend again.
What, is't murder?
No.
Lechery?
Call it so.
Away, sir!
you must go.
One word, good friend.
Lucio, a word with you.
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?
With child, perhaps?
Unhappily, even so.
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
Within two hours.
Come, officer, away!
May your grace speak of it?
My holy sir, none better knows than you How I have ever loved the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
Gladly, my lord.
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, Which for this nineteen years we have let slip; Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, That goes not out to prey.
It rested in your grace To unloose this tied up justice when you pleased: And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd Than in Lord Angelo.
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
Are not these large enough?
Ho!
Peace be in this place!
Who's that which calls?
It is a man's voice.
Peace and prosperity!
Who is't that calls?
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek roses Proclaim you are no less!
Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella, A novice of this place and the fair sister To her unhappy brother Claudio?
Why "her unhappy brother?"
let me ask, The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella and his sister.
Woe me!
for what?
Sir, make me not your story.
It is true.
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
Do not believe it.
Some one with child by him?
My cousin JULIET?
Is she your cousin?
Adoptedly; as school maids change their names By vain though apt affection.
She it is.
O, let him marry her.
This is the point.
Doth he so seek his life?
Alas!
what poor ability's in me To do him good?
Assay the power you have.
My power?
Alas, I doubt
I'll see what I can do.
But speedily.
I will about it straight; No longer staying but to give the mother Notice of my affair.
I take my leave of you.
Good sir, adieu.
Ay, but yet Let us be keen, and rather cut a little, Than fall, and bruise to death.
Alas, this gentleman Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, Another thing to fall.
I not deny, The jury, passing on the prisoner's life, May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try.
Be it as your wisdom will.
Where is the provost?
Here, if it like your honour.
Well, heaven forgive him!
and forgive us all!
How now, sir!
What's your name?
and what's the matter?
Benefactors?
Well; what benefactors are they?
are they not malefactors?
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
Go to: what quality are they of?
Elbow is your name?
why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
What are you, sir?
He, sir!
How know you that?
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,
How?
thy wife?
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,
Dost thou detest her therefore?
How dost thou know that, constable?
By the woman's means?
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man; prove it.
Do you hear how he misplaces?
No, indeed.
Ay, so I did indeed.
All this is true.
Why, very well, then,
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose.
What was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to complain of?
Come me to what was done to her.
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave.
All hallond eve.
Why, very well; I hope here be truths.
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
I think no less.
Good morrow to your lordship.
Once, sir?
there was nothing done to her once.
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
I beseech your honour, ask me.
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose.
Doth your honour mark his face?
Ay, sir, very well.
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
Well, I do so.
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
Why, no.
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him.
Good, then; if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm?
I would know that of your honour.
He's in the right.
Constable, what say you to it?
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all.
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet!
the time has yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
Which is the wiser here?
Justice or Iniquity?
Is this true?
O thou caitiff!
O thou varlet!
O thou wicked Hannibal!
I respected with her before I was married to her!
If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me the poor duke's officer.
Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your action of slander too.
Marry, I thank your good worship for it.
What is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are.
Marry, I thank your worship for it.
Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
Where were you born, friend?
Here in Vienna, sir.
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
Yes, an't please you, sir.
So.
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
Your mistress' name?
Mistress Overdone.
Hath she had any more than one husband?
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
Nine!
Come hither to me, Master Froth.
I thank your worship.
For mine own part, I never come into any room in a tap house, but I am drawn in.
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Pompey.
What else?
Bum, sir.
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great.
Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not?
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
How would you live, Pompey?
by being a bawd?
What do you think of the trade, Pompey?
is it a lawful trade?
If the law would allow it, sir.
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?
No, Pompey.
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: it is but heading and hanging.
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master constable.
How long have you been in this place of constable?
Seven year and a half, sir.
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had continued in it some time.
You say, seven years together?
And a half, sir.
Alas, it hath been great pains to you.
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.
To your worship's house, sir?
To my house.
Fare you well.
Eleven, sir.
I pray you home to dinner with me.
I humbly thank you.
It grieves me for the death of Claudio; But there's no remedy.
Lord Angelo is severe.
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight I'll tell him of you.
Pray you, do.
Now, what's the matter.
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
Did not I tell thee yea?
hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning JULIET?
She's very near her hour.
Dispose of her To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd Desires access to you.
Hath he a sister?
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid, And to be shortly of a sisterhood, If not already.
Well, let her be admitted.
God save your honour!
Stay a little while.
You're welcome: what's your will?
Well; what's your suit?
Well; the matter?
Heaven give thee moving graces!
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then.
Heaven keep your honour!
Must he needs die?
Maiden, no remedy.
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him, And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
I will not do't.
But can you, if you would?
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
You are too cold.
Too late?
Pray you, be gone.
I would to heaven I had your potency, And you were Isabel!
should it then be thus?
Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
Your brother is a forfeit of the law, And you but waste your words.
Alas, alas!
To morrow!
O, that's sudden!
Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death.
Ay, well said.
Yet show some pity.
So you must be the first that gives this sentence, And he, that suffer's.
That's well said.
O, to him, to him, wench!
he will relent; He's coming; I perceive 't.
Pray heaven she win him!
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
That in the captain's but a choleric word, Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
Art avised o' that?
more on 't.
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
Because authority, though it err like others, Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself, That skins the vice o' the top.
She speaks, and 'tis Such sense, that my sense breeds with it.
Fare you well.
Gentle my lord, turn back.
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
How!
bribe me?
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
You had marr'd all else.
Well; come to me to morrow.
Go to; 'tis well; away!
Heaven keep your honour safe!
At what hour to morrow Shall I attend your lordship?
At any time 'fore noon.
'Save your honour!
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this?
Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Hail to you, provost!
so I think you are.
I am the provost.
What's your will, good friar?
Bound by my charity and my blest order, I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison.
Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes, that I may minister To them accordingly.
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
When must he die?
As I do think, to morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile,  And you shall be conducted.
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, And try your penitence, if it be sound, Or hollowly put on.
I'll gladly learn.
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed?
Mutually.
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
I do repent me, as it is an evil, And take the shame with joy.
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to morrow, And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!
Must die to morrow!
O injurious love, That respites me a life, whose very comfort Is still a dying horror!
'Tis pity of him.
When I would pray and think, I think and pray To several subjects.
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
Teach her the way.
I am come to know your pleasure.
That you might know it, would much better please me Than to demand what 'tis.
Your brother cannot live.
Even so.
Heaven keep your honour!
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be, As long as you or I; yet he must die.
Under your sentence?
Yea.
When, I beseech you?
that in his reprieve, Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not.
Ha!
fie, these filthy vices!
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
Say you so?
Sir, believe this, I had rather give my body than my soul.
How say you?
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak Against the thing I say.
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul, Were equal poise of sin and charity.
That I do beg his life, if it be sin, Heaven let me bear it!
Nay, but hear me.
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, But graciously to know I am no better.
So.
And his offence is so, as it appears, Accountant to the law upon that pain.
True.
Then must your brother die.
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slander'd so?
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses: lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice.
We are all frail.
Else let my brother die, If not a feodary, but only he Owe and succeed thy weakness.
Nay, women are frail too.
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves; Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women!
Help Heaven!
men their creation mar In profiting by them.
Nay, call us ten times frail; For we are soft as our complexions are, And credulous to false prints.
Plainly conceive, I love you.
My brother did love JULIET, And you tell me that he shall die for it.
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
I know your virtue hath a licence in't, Which seems a little fouler than it is, To pluck on others.
Believe me, on mine honour, My words express my purpose.
Ha!
little honour to be much believed, And most pernicious purpose!
Seeming, seeming!
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
To whom should I complain?
Did I tell this, Who would believe me?
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
I humbly thank you.
What, ho!
Peace here; grace and good company!
Who's there?
come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
Most holy sir, I thank you.
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
And very welcome.
Look, signior, here's your sister.
Provost, a word with you.
As many as you please.
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
Why, As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Is there no remedy?
None, but such remedy as, to save a head, To cleave a heart in twain.
But is there any?
Perpetual durance?
But in what nature?
In such a one as, you consenting to't, Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, And leave you naked.
Let me know the point.
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch From flowery tenderness?
If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride, And hug it in mine arms.
The prenzie Angelo!
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, The damned'st body to invest and cover In prenzie guards!
Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity, Thou mightst be freed.
O heavens!
it cannot be.
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, So to offend him still.
This night's the time That I should do what I abhor to name, Or else thou diest to morrow.
Thou shalt not do't.
O, were it but my life, I'ld throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin.
Thanks, dear Isabel.
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
Yes.
Has he affections in him, That thus can make him bite the law by the nose, When he would force it?
Which is the least?
If it were damnable, he being so wise, Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fined?
O Isabel!
What says my brother?
Death is a fearful thing.
And shamed life a hateful.
Alas, alas!
O you beast!
O faithless coward!
O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life From thine own sister's shame?
What should I think?
Nay, hear me, Isabel.
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd: 'Tis best thou diest quickly.
O hear me, Isabella!
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
What is your will?
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister.
Let me ask my sister pardon.
I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
Hold you there: farewell.
What's your will, father?
That now you are come, you will be gone.
In good time.
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born.
But, O, how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo!
I f ever he return and I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.
Let me hear you speak farther.
I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.
Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
Can this be so?
did Angelo so leave her?
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world!
What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live!
But how out of this can she avail?
Show me how, good father.
It lies much in your holding up.
I thank you for this comfort.
Fare you well, good father.
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
O heavens!
what stuff is here?
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and furred with fox and lamb skins too, to signify, that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
Come your way, sir.
'Bless you, good father friar.
And you, good brother father.
What offence hath this man made you, sir?
Fie, sirrah!
a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, Thou wilt prove his.
That we were all, as some would seem to be, From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
His neck will come to your waist,  a cord, sir.
I spy comfort; I cry bail.
Here's a gentleman and a friend of mine.
How now, noble Pompey!
What, at the wheels of Caesar?
art thou led in triumph?
What, is there none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd?
What reply, ha?
Still thus, and thus; still worse!
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress?
Procures she still, ha?
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub.
Yes, faith, sir.
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey.
Farewell: go, say I sent thee thither.
For debt, Pompey?
or how?
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
And you.
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
Come your ways, sir; come.
You will not bail me, then, sir?
Then, Pompey, nor now.
What news abroad, friar?
what news?
Come your ways, sir; come.
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
I know none.
Can you tell me of any?
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to.
Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to 't.
He does well in 't.
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
How should he be made, then?
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man!
Would the duke that is absent have done this?
I never heard the absent duke much detected for women; he was not inclined that way.
O, sir, you are deceived.
'Tis not possible.
Who, not the duke?
yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish: the duke had crotchets in him.
He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.
You do him wrong, surely.
Sir, I was an inward of his.
A shy fellow was the duke: and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
Wise!
why, no question but he was.
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.
Come, sir, I know what I know.
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
But, if ever the duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him.
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
I fear you not.
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.
But indeed I can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, friar.
But no more of this.
Canst thou tell if Claudio die to morrow or no?
Why should he die, sir?
Why?
For filling a bottle with a tundish.
No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure 'scape; back wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes.
What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
Go; away with her to prison!
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind!
This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your honour.
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for the entertainment of death.
Good even, good father.
Bliss and goodness on you!
Of whence are you?
What news abroad i' the world?
One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.
What pleasure was he given to?
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a gentleman of all temperance.
You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling.
I am going to visit the prisoner.
Fare you well.
Peace be with you!
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired for me here to day?
much upon this time have I promised here to meet.
You have not been inquired after: I have sat here all day.
I do constantly believe you.
The time is come even now.
I shall crave your forbearance a little: may be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
I am always bound to you.
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
Are there no other tokens Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this.
What, ho!
within!
come forth!
I do desire the like.
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
Take, then, this your companion by the hand, Who hath a story ready for your ear.
Will't please you walk aside?
O place and greatness!
Welcome, how agreed?
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father, If you advise it.
It is not my consent, But my entreaty too.
Little have you to say When you depart from him, but, soft and low, "Remember now my brother.  "
Fear me not.
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
Come hither, sirrah.
Can you cut off a man's head?
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a direct answer.
To morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine.
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman.
I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner.
What, ho!
Abhorson!
Where's Abhorson, there?
Do you call, sir?
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to morrow in your execution.
A bawd, sir?
fie upon him!
he will discredit our mystery.
Pray, sir, by your good favour,  for surely, sir, a good favour you have, but that you have a hanging look,  do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
Ay, sir; a mystery
Sir, it is a mystery.
Proof?
Are you agreed?
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe to morrow four o'clock.
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
None, since the curfew rung.
Not Isabel?
No.
They will, then, ere't be long.
What comfort is for Claudio?
There's some in hope.
It is a bitter deputy.
There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet, But he must die to morrow?
None, sir, none.
As near the dawning, provost, as it is, You shall hear more ere morning.
And here comes Claudio's pardon.
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.
Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost day.
I shall obey him.
This is his pardon, purchased by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in.
I told you.
Pray you, let's hear.
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon?
How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him?
I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
It is now apparent?
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
Hath he born himself penitently in prison?
how seems he to be touched?
He wants advice.
More of him anon.
Pray, sir, in what?
In the delaying death.
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide.
Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
To him, and to his substitutes.
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing?
But what likelihood is in that?
Not a resemblance, but a certainty.
Yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
I know them both.
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
Master Barnardine!
you must rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!
What, ho, Barnardine!
A pox o' your throats!
Who makes that noise there?
What are you?
Your friends, sir; the hangman.
You must be so good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
Away, you rogue, away!
I am sleepy.
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep afterwards.
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
Very ready, sir.
How now, Abhorson?
what's the news with you?
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you and pray with you.
I swear I will not die to day for any man's persuasion.
But hear you.
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
O , 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
This shall be done, good father, presently.
Let this be done.
I am your free dependant.
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
Convenient is it.
Make a swift return; For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours.
I'll make all speed.
Peace, ho, be here!
The tongue of Isabel.
Ho, by your leave!
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
Nay, but it is not so.
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
You shall not be admitted to his sight.
Unhappy Claudio!
wretched Isabel!
Injurious world!
most damned Angelo!
I am directed by you.
Good even.
Friar, where's the provost?
Not within, sir.
Well, you'll answer this one day.
Fare ye well.
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
Did you such a thing?
Sir, your company is fairer than honest.
Rest you well.
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
In most uneven and distracted manner.
I guess not.
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
I shall, sir.
Fare you well.
Good night.
These letters at fit time deliver me.
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction, And hold you ever to our special drift; Though sometimes you do blench from this to that, As cause doth minister.
It shall be speeded well.
Be ruled by him.
I would Friar Peter
O, peace!
the friar is come.
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, Where you may have such vantage on the duke, He shall not pass you.
Twice have the trumpets sounded; The generous and gravest citizens
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
Happy return be to your royal grace!
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
You make my bonds still greater.
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
Justice, O royal duke!
Relate your wrongs; in what?
by whom?
be brief.
By course of justice!
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
Nay, it is ten times strange.
Away with her!
Poor soul, She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest There is another comfort than this world, That thou neglect me not, with that opinion That I am touch'd with madness!
Many that are not mad Have, sure, more lack of reason.
What would you say?
That's he indeed.
You were not bid to speak.
No, my good lord; Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
I warrant your honour.
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,
Right.
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong To speak before your time.
Proceed.
I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy,
That's somewhat madly spoken.
Pardon it; The phrase is to the matter.
Mended again.
The matter; proceed.
This is most likely!
O, that it were as like as it is true!
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour In hateful practise.
First, his integrity Stands without blemish.
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above, Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance!
Heaven shield your grace from woe, As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
I know you'ld fain be gone.
An officer!
To prison with her!
Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall On him so near us?
This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
A ghostly father, belike.
Who knows that Lodowick?
Words against me?
this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute!
Let this friar be found.
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard Your royal ear abused.
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
My lord, most villanously; believe it.
Well, he in time may come to clear himself; But at this instant he is sick my lord, Of a strange fever.
Good friar, let's hear it.
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face Until my husband bid me.
What, are you married?
No, my lord.
Are you a maid?
No, my lord.
A widow, then?
Neither, my lord.
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
Well, my lord.
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
Well, my lord.
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
Charges she more than me?
Not that I know.
No?
you say your husband.
This is a strange abuse.
Let's see thy face.
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
Know you this woman?
Carnally, she says.
Sirrah, no more!
Enough, my lord.
Would he were here, my lord!
Go do it instantly.
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a notable fellow.
As any in Vienna, on my word.
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Not better than he, by her own report.
Say you?
I will go darkly to work with her.
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with the provost.
Mum.
'Tis false.
How!
know you where you are?
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: Look you speak justly.
Boldly, at least.
But, O, poor souls, Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress!
Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too.
The duke's unjust, Thus to retort your manifest appeal, And put your trial in the villain's mouth Which here you come to accuse.
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
Slander to the state!
Away with him to prison!
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
'Tis he, my lord.
Come hither, goodman baldpate: do you know me?
O, did you so?
And do you remember what you said of the duke?
Most notedly, sir.
Do you so, sir?
And was the duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
O thou damnable fellow!
Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches?
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal.
Away with him to prison!
Where is the provost?
Away with him to prison!
lay bolts enough upon him: let him speak no more.
Away with those giglots too, and with the other confederate companion!
Stay, sir; stay awhile.
What, resists he?
Help him, Lucio.
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir!
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
This may prove worse than hanging.
O my dread lord, I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, To think I can be undiscernible, When I perceive your grace, like power divine, Hath look'd upon my passes.
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
I was, my lord.
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate, Return him here again.
Go with him, provost.
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it.
Come hither, Isabel.
I do, my lord.
O my most gracious lord, I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
O my dear lord, I crave no other, nor no better man.
Never crave him; we are definitive.
Gentle my liege,
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.
O my good lord!
He dies for Claudio's death.
Merely, my lord.
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour?
It was commanded so.
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
No, my good lord; it was by private message.
For which I do discharge you of your office: Give up your keys.
What's he?
His name is Barnardine.
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd, Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
Which is that Barnardine?
This, my lord.
There was a friar told me of this man.
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head; As like almost to Claudio as himself.
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits.
Take him to prison; And see our pleasure herein executed.
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.
Slandering a prince deserves it.
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.
He is very near by this.
He was not three leagues off when I left him.
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
But few of any sort, and none of name.
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers.
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro.
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
Did he break out into tears?
In great measure.
I pray you, is Signor Montanto returned from the wars or no?
I know none of that name, lady.
There was none such in the army of any sort.
What is he that you ask for, niece?
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.
Oh, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it.
He is a very valiant trencherman.
He hath an excellent stomach.
And a good soldier too, lady.
And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.
It is so indeed.
He is no less than a stuffed man.
But for the stuffing well, we are all mortal.
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.
They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.
Alas, he gets nothing by that.
Is ’t possible?
Very easily possible.
He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
No.
An he were, I would burn my study.
But I pray you, who is his companion?
Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease!
He is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad.
God help the noble Claudio!
If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured.
I will hold friends with you, lady.
Do, good friend.
You will never run mad, niece.
No, not till a hot January.
Don Pedro is approached.
You embrace your charge too willingly.
I think this is your daughter.
Her mother hath many times told me so.
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
You have it full, Benedick.
If Signor Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick.
Nobody marks you.
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signor Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
A dear happiness to women.
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that.
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentle man or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face.
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer.
But keep your way, i' God’s name.
I have done.
You always end with a jade’s trick.
I know you of old.
That is the sum of all, Leonato.
Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer.
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
Let me bid you welcome, my lord.
I thank you.
I am not of many words, but I thank you.
Please it your Grace lead on?
Your hand, Leonato.
We will go together.
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
I noted her not, but I looked on her.
Is she not a modest young lady?
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment?
Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
Why, i' faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.
Thou thinkest I am in sport.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
Can the world buy such a jewel?
Yea, and a case to put it into.
But speak you this with a sad brow?
Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter?
Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
There’s her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
Is ’t come to this?
In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three score again?
Go to, i' faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays.
Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato’s?
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
You hear, Count Claudio?
If this were so, so were it uttered.
Like the old tale, my lord: “It is not so nor ’twas not so but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
By my troth, I speak my thought.
That I love her, I feel.
That she is worthy, I know.
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
That a woman conceived me, I thank her.
That she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks.
But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me.
Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none.
And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love.
Well, as time shall try.
In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn mad.
I look for an earthquake too, then.
Well, you temporize with the hours.
In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s.
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you
To the tuition of God.
From my house, if I had it
The sixth of July.
Your loving friend, Benedick.
Nay, mock not, mock not.
The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither.
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
My love is thine to teach.
Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words.
How sweetly you do minister to love, That know love’s grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son?
Hath he provided this music?
He is very busy about it.
But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
Are they good?
As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward.
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
A good sharp fellow.
I will send for him, and question him yourself.
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself.
But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true.
Go you and tell her of it.
What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds.
Therefore the sadness is without limit.
You should hear reason.
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief.
I cannot hide what I am.
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.
Can you make no use of your discontent?
I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Who comes here?
I came yonder from a great supper.
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.
Who?
The most exquisite Claudio?
Even he.
A proper squire.
And who, and who?
Which way looks he?
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
A very forward March chick!
How came you to this?
Come, come, let us thither.
This may prove food to my displeasure.
That young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow.
If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.
You are both sure, and will assist me?
To the death, my lord.
Let us to the great supper.
Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued.
We’ll wait upon your lordship.
Was not Count John here at supper?
I saw him not.
How tartly that gentleman looks!
I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick.
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
In faith, she’s too curst.
Too curst is more than curst.
I shall lessen God’s sending that way, for it is said, “God sends a curst cow short horns,” but to a cow too curst, he sends none.
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening.
Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face!
I had rather lie in the woolen.
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
What should I do with him?
Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman?
Well then, go you into hell?
Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say, “Father, as it please you.
” But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say, “Father, as it please me.
Daughter, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust?
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I’ll none.
Adam’s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
Daughter, remember what I told you.
If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time.
If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer.
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
I have a good eye, uncle.
I can see a church by daylight.
The revelers are entering, brother.
Make good room.
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?
So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.
With me in your company?
I may say so when I please.
And when please you to say so?
When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!
Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
Speak low if you speak love.
Well, I would you did like me.
Which is one?
I say my prayers aloud.
I love you the better; the hearers may cry “Amen.
God match me with a good dancer!
Amen.
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done!
Answer, clerk.
No more words.
The clerk is answered.
I know you well enough.
You are Signor Antonio.
At a word, I am not.
I know you by the waggling of your head.
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
You could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man.
Here’s his dry hand up and down.
You are he, you are he.
At a word, I am not.
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?
Can virtue hide itself?
Go to, mum, you are he.
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.
Will you not tell me who told you so?
No, you shall pardon me.
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
Not now.
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales!
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so.
What’s he?
I am sure you know him well enough.
Not I, believe me.
Did he never make you laugh?
I pray you, what is he?
Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.
When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.
Do, do.
In every good thing.
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her, and but one visor remains.
And that is Claudio.
I know him by his bearing.
Are not you Signor Benedick?
You know me well.
I am he.
Signor, you are very near my brother in his love.
He is enamored on Hero.
I pray you, dissuade him from her.
How know you he loves her?
I heard him swear his affection.
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
Come, let us to the banquet.
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love.
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.
Count Claudio?
Yea, the same.
Come, will you go with me?
Whither?
Even to the next willow, about your own business, county.
What fashion will you wear the garland of?
About your neck like an usurer’s chain?
Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf?
You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath gat your Hero.
I wish him joy of her.
Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks.
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?
I pray you, leave me.
Ho, now you strike like the blind man.
'Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.
If it will not be, I’ll leave you.
Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me!
Now, Signior, where’s the Count?
Did you see him?
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.
To be whipped?
What’s his fault?
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?
The transgression is in the stealer.
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her.
My very visor began to assume life and scold with her.
Look, here she comes.
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end?
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.
I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John’s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy.
You have no employment for me?
None but to desire your good company.
O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not.
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue!
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools.
I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
Why, how now, Count, wherefore are you sad?
Not sad, my lord.
How then, sick?
Neither, my lord.
The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true, though, I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false.
Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won.
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained.
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes.
His grace hath made the match, and all grace say “Amen” to it.
Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
Yea, my lord.
I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
And so she doth, cousin.
Good Lord for alliance!
Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
I would rather have one of your father’s getting.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?
Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
Will you have me, lady?
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days.
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day.
But I beseech your Grace pardon me.
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
I cry you mercy, uncle.
By your Grace’s pardon.
By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.
There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.
She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
Oh, by no means.
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
Tomorrow, my lord.
Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.
And I, my lord.
And you too, gentle Hero?
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know.
It is so.
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine.
How canst thou cross this marriage?
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.
Show me briefly how.
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
I remember.
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
The poison of that lies in you to temper.
Go you to the Prince your brother.
What proof shall I make of that?
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato.
Look you for any other issue?
Only to despite them, I will endeavor anything.
Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone.
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me.
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus.
They will scarcely believe this without trial.
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice.
Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
Boy!
Signior?
In my chamber window lies a book.
Bring it hither to me in the orchard.
I am here already, sir.
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
Come, shall we hear this music?
Yea, my good lord.
How still the evening is, As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
O, very well, my lord.
The music ended, We’ll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth.
Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once.
It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
Note this before my notes: There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!
Note notes, forsooth, and nothing.
Now, divine air!
Now is his soul ravished.
Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies?
By my troth, a good song.
And an ill singer, my lord.
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him.
And I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief.
I had as lief have heard the night raven, come what plague could have come after it.
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?
I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window
The best I can, my lord.
Do so.
Farewell.
Oh, ay.
Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits.
I did never think that lady would have loved any man.
Is ’t possible?
Sits the wind in that corner?
May be she doth but counterfeit.
Faith, like enough.
O God!
Counterfeit?
There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.
Why, what effects of passion shows she?
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
What effects, my lord?
She will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how.
She did indeed.
How, how I pray you?
You amaze me.
I should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it.
Knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence.
He hath ta'en th' infection.
Hold it up.
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
No, and swears she never will.
That’s her torment.
'Tis true indeed, so your daughter says.
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told.
That.
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her.
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: “O sweet Benedick!
God give me patience!
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
To what end?
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.
An he should, it were an alms to hang him.
She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.
And she is exceeding wise.
In every thing but in loving Benedick.
Oh, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.
I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.
Were it good, think you?
She doth well.
If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
He is a very proper man.
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
Before God, and in my mind, very wise.
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
And I take him to be valiant.
And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make.
Well, I am sorry for your niece.
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
Nay, that’s impossible.
She may wear her heart out first.
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter.
Let it cool the while.
I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
My lord, will you walk?
Dinner is ready.
If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation.
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry.
The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter.
This can be no trick.
The conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady.
It seems her affections have their full bent.
Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
You take pleasure then in the message?
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal.
You have no stomach, Signior.
Fare you well.
Ha!
“Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
” There’s a double meaning in that.
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her.
Say that thou overheardst us, And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it.
There will she hide her To listen our propose.
This is thy office.
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice.
Of this matter Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay.
The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.
I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock.
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
So says the Prince and my new trothèd lord.
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Why did you so?
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
O god of love!
I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man, But Nature never framed a woman’s heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
Why, you speak truth.
I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured But she would spell him backward.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
But who dare tell her so?
If I should speak, She would mock me into air.
Yet tell her of it.
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have, as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
When are you married, madam?
Why, every day, tomorrow.
Come, go in.
I’ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.
She’s limed, I warrant you.
We have caught her, madam.
What fire is in mine ears?
Can this be true?
Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adieu!
No glory lives behind the back of such.
And Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band.
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Aragon.
I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth.
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.
He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
So say I.   Methinks you are sadder.
I hope he be in love.
Hang him, truant!
There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love.
If he be sad, he wants money.
I have the toothache.
Draw it.
Hang it!
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
What, sigh for the toothache?
Where is but a humor or a worm.
Well, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.
Yet say I, he is in love.
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs.
He brushes his hat o' mornings.
What should that bode?
Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?
Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
Nay, he rubs himself with civet.
Can you smell him out by that?
That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in love.
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
And when was he wont to wash his face?
Yea, or to paint himself?
For the which I hear what they say of him.
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him.
Conclude, conclude, he is in love.
Nay, but I know who loves him.
That would I know too.
I warrant, one that knows him not.
Yes, and his ill conditions, and, in despite of all, dies for him.
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.
Old Signior, walk aside with me.
I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobbyhorses must not hear.
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!
'Tis even so.
My lord and brother, God save you.
Good e'en, brother.
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
In private?
If it please you.
Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.
What’s the matter?
Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?
You know he does.
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
You may think I love you not.
Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.
Why, what’s the matter?
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a talking of, the lady is disloyal.
Who, Hero?
Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Disloyal?
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness.
I could say she were worse.
Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.
Wonder not till further warrant.
Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day.
If you love her then, tomorrow wed her.
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind.
May this be so?
I will not think it.
If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know.
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses.
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself.
O day untowardly turned!
O mischief strangely thwarting!
O plague right well prevented!
So will you say when you have seen the sequel.
Are you good men and true?
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write and read.
Come hither, neighbor Seacole.
God hath blessed you with a good name.
To be a well favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.
Both which, Master Constable
You have.
I knew it would be your answer.
How if he will not stand?
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects.
We will rather sleep than talk.
We know what belongs to a watch.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend.
Only have a care that your bills be not stolen.
Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
How if they will not?
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober.
If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.
Well, sir.
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
Truly, by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled.
The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.
If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
'Tis very true.
This is the end of the charge.
You, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person.
If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.
Nay, by 'r Lady, that I think he cannot.
By 'r lady, I think it be so.
Ha, ha, ha!
Well, masters, good night.
An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.
Keep your fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
Come, neighbor.
Well, masters, we hear our charge.
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.
One word more, honest neighbors.
What Conrad!
Peace!
Stir not.
Conrad, I say!
Here, man.
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.
I will owe thee an answer for that.
And now forward with thy tale.
Some treason, masters.
Yet stand close.
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich.
For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.
I wonder at it.
That shows thou art unconfirmed.
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
Yes, it is apparel.
I mean the fashion.
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.
But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?
I know that Deformed.
He has been a vile thief this seven year.
He goes up and down like a gentleman.
I remember his name.
Didst thou not hear somebody?
No, ’twas the vane on the house.
All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man.
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Not so, neither.
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.
She leans me out at her mistress' chamber window, bids me a thousand times good night.
I tell this tale vilely.
I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, stand!
Call up the right Master Constable.
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.
And one Deformed is one of them.
I know him; he wears a lock.
Masters, masters
You’ll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
A commodity in question, I warrant you.
Come, we’ll obey you.
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise.
I will, lady.
And bid her come hither.
Well.
Troth, I think your other rebato were better.
No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.
By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant your cousin will say so.
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.
I’ll wear none but this.
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i' faith.
I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.
Oh, that exceeds, they say.
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
Fie upon thee!
Art not ashamed?
Of what, lady?
Of speaking honorably?
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar?
Is not your lord honorable without marriage?
Good morrow, coz.
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
Why, how now?
Do you speak in the sick tune?
I am out of all other tune, methinks.
Clap ’s into “Light o' love.
” That goes without a burden.
Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.
Ye light o' love, with your heels!
Then, if your husband have stables enough, you’ll see he shall lack no barns.
O illegitimate construction!
I scorn that with my heels.
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin.
'Tis time you were ready.
By my troth, I am exceeding ill.   Heigh ho!
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
For the letter that begins them all, H.
Well, an you be not turned Turk, there’s no more sailing by the star.
What means the fool, trow?
Nothing, I; but God send everyone their heart’s desire.
These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excellent perfume.
I am stuffed, cousin.
I cannot smell.
A maid, and stuffed!
There’s goodly catching of cold.
Oh, God help me, God help me!
How long have you professed apprehension?
Even since you left it.
Doth not my wit become me rarely?
It is not seen enough; you should wear it in your cap.
By my troth, I am sick.
Get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus and lay it to your heart.
It is the only thing for a qualm.
There thou prick’st her with a thistle.
Benedictus!
Why benedictus?
You have some moral in this benedictus?
Moral!
No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning.
I meant plain holy thistle.
You may think perchance that I
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
Not a false gallop.
Madam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signor Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
What would you with me, honest neighbor?
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly.
Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.
Marry, this it is, sir.
Yes, in truth it is, sir.
What is it, my good friends?
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I.
Comparisons are odorous.
Palabras , neighbor Verges.
Neighbors, you are tedious.
It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s officers.
But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
All thy tediousness on me, ah?
Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
And so am I.
I would fain know what you have to say.
Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your Worship’s presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.
Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.
Gifts that God gives.
I must leave you.
One word, sir.
Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship.
Take their examination yourself and bring it me.
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
It shall be suffigance.
Drink some wine ere you go.
Fare you well.
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.
I’ll wait upon them.
I am ready.
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole.
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.
We are now to examination these men.
And we must do it wisely.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.
Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.
Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the jail.
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
No.
To be married to her.
Friar, you come to marry her.
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
I do.
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined, charge you on your souls to utter it.
Know you any, Hero?
None, my lord.
Know you any, count?
I dare make his answer, none.
O, what men dare do!
What men may do!
What men daily do, not knowing what they do!
How now, interjections?
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
Stand thee by, Friar.
Father, by your leave, Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul Give me this maid, your daughter?
As freely, son, as God did give her me.
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
Nothing, unless you render her again.
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
There, Leonato, take her back again.
Give not this rotten orange to your friend.
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
Oh, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?
What do you mean, my lord?
Dear my lord, if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?
Out on thee, seeming!
I will write against it.
You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.
But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pampered animals That rage in savage sensuality.
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
What should I speak?
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
This looks not like a nuptial.
True!
O God!
Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the Prince?
Is this the Prince’s brother?
Is this face Hero’s?
Are our eyes our own?
All this is so, but what of this, my lord?
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
Oh, God defend me!
how am I beset!
What kind of catechizing call you this?
Is it not Hero?
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?
Marry, that can Hero!
I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.
Why, then are you no maiden.
Leonato, I am sorry you must hear.
Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?
Why, how now, cousin!
wherefore sink you down?
Come, let us go.
These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.
How doth the lady?
Dead, I think.
Help, uncle!
Hero, why, Hero!
Uncle!
Signor Benedick!
Friar!
How now, cousin Hero!
Have comfort, lady.
Dost thou look up?
Yea, wherefore should she not?
Wherefore!
Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her?
Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood?
Sir, sir, be patient.
For my part, I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say.
Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
Confirmed, confirmed!
Oh, that is stronger made Which was before barred up with ribs of iron!
Friar, it cannot be.
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury.
Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
They know that do accuse me.
I know none.
If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy!
O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintained the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
There is some strange misprision in the princes.
I know not.
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Your daughter here the princes left for dead.
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed.
Maintain a mourning ostentation, And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.
What shall become of this?
What will this do?
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.
'Tis well consented.
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
I will not desire that.
You have no reason.
I do it freely.
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
Is there any way to show such friendship?
A very even way, but no such friend.
May a man do it?
It is a man’s office, but not yours.
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.
Is not that strange?
As strange as the thing I know not.
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
Do not swear, and eat it.
I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make him eat it that says I love not you.
Will you not eat your word?
With no sauce that can be devised to it.
I protest I love thee.
Why then, God forgive me.
What offense, sweet Beatrice?
You have stayed me in a happy hour.
I was about to protest I loved you.
And do it with all thy heart.
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.
Come, bid me do anything for thee.
Kill Claudio.
Ha!
Not for the wide world.
You kill me to deny it.
Farewell.
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
I am gone, though I am here.
There is no love in you.
Nay, I pray you let me go.
Beatrice
In faith, I will go.
We’ll be friends first.
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
Is Claudio thine enemy?
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?
Oh, that I were a man!
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor  O God, that I were a man!
I would eat his heart in the marketplace.
Hear me, Beatrice
Talk with a man out at a window!
A proper saying!
Nay, but Beatrice
Beat
Princes and counties!
Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely!
Oh, that I were a man for his sake!
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!
But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too.
He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it.
I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
Tarry, good Beatrice.
By this hand, I love thee.
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
Oh, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.
Which be the malefactors?
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Nay, that’s certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
But which are the offenders that are to be examined?
Let them come before Master Constable.
Yea, marry, let them come before me.
Borachio.
Pray, write down, “Borachio.
” Yours, sirrah?
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrad.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrad.
” Masters, do you serve God?
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you, but I will go about with him.
Come you hither, sirrah, a word in your ear.
Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.
Sir, I say to you we are none.
Well, stand aside.
'Fore God, they are both in a ale.
Have you writ down that they are none?
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine.
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.
Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.
Write down Prince John a villain.
Why, this is flat perjury, to call a prince’s brother villain.
Master Constable
Pray thee, fellow, peace.
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
What heard you him say else?
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
Yea, by Mass, that it is.
What else, fellow?
And that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.
O villain!
Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this.
What else?
This is all.
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner refused, and upon the grief of this, suddenly died.
Master Constable, let these men be bound and brought to Leonato’s.
I will go before and show him their examination.
Come, let them be opinioned.
Let them be in the hands
Off, coxcomb!
God’s my life, where’s the Sexton?
Let him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb.
” Come, bind them.
Thou naughty varlet!
Away!
You are an ass, you are an ass!
Dost thou not suspect my place?
Dost thou not suspect my years?
Oh, that he were here to write me down an ass!
Therein do men from children nothing differ.
I pray thee, peace.
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.
Make those that do offend you suffer too.
There thou speak’st reason.
Nay, I will do so.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
Good e'en, good e'en.
Good day to both of you.
Hear you, my lords
We have some haste, Leonato.
Some haste, my lord!
Well, fare you well, my lord.
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
Who wrongs him?
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.
I fear thee not.
Marry, beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear.
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.
My villainy?
Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.
You say not right, old man.
Away!
I will not have to do with you.
Canst thou so daff me?
Thou hast killed my child.
If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed, But that’s no matter.
Let him kill one first.
Win me and wear me!
Brother
Content yourself.
Brother Anthony
Hold you content.
But brother Anthony
Come, ’tis no matter.
Do not you meddle.
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.
My lord, my lord
I will not hear you.
No?
Come, brother; away!
I will be heard.
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
Now, Signior, what news?
Good day, my lord.
Welcome, Signior.
You are almost come to part almost a fray.
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.
Leonato and his brother.
What think’st thou?
Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
In a false quarrel there is no true valor.
I came to seek you both.
It is in my scabbard.
Shall I draw it?
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit.
As I am an honest man, he looks pale.
Art thou sick, or angry?
What, courage, man!
What though care killed a cat?
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me.
I pray you, choose another subject.
Nay, then, give him another staff.
This last was broke 'cross.
By this light, he changes more and more.
I think he be angry indeed.
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
God bless me from a challenge!
You are a villain.
I jest not.
I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
What, a feast, a feast?
I' faith, I thank him.
He hath bid me to a calf’s head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s naught.
Shall I not find a woodcock too?
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day.
I said thou hadst a fine wit.
“True,” said she, “a fine little one.
” “No,” said I, “a great wit.
” “Right,” says she, “a great gross one.
” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.
” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.
” “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.
” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.
” “Nay,” said I, “he hath the tongues.
” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.
” Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues.
Yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper’st man in Italy.
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
Yea, that she did.
But yet for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly.
The old man’s daughter told us all.
All, all.
But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head?
Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick the married man?”
Fare you well, boy.
You know my mind.
I will leave you now to your gossip like humor.
You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not.
My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you.
I must discontinue your company.
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina.
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady.
For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.
He is in earnest.
And hath challenged thee?
Most sincerely.
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
But soft you, let me be.
Pluck up, my heart, and be sad.
Did he not say my brother was fled?
Come you, sir.
If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance.
Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
How now?
Two of my brother’s men bound!
Borachio one!
Hearken after their offense, my lord.
Officers, what offense have these men done?
Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer?
This learned constable is too cunning to be understood.
What’s your offense?
Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer.
Do you hear me, and let this count kill me.
I have deceived
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.
But did my brother set thee on to this?
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
Come, bring away the plaintiffs.
By this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter.
And, masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the Sexton too.
Which is the villain?
Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him.
Which of these is he?
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?
Yea, even I alone.
No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.
Here stand a pair of honorable men  A third is fled that had a hand in it.
I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death.
Record it with your high and worthy deeds.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
I know not how to pray your patience, Yet I must speak.
Choose your revenge yourself.
Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin.
Yet sinned I not But in mistaking.
O noble sir!
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.
Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass.
I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment.
And also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed.
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.
There’s for thy pains.
God save the foundation!
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship, which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself, for the example of others.
God keep your Worship!
I wish your Worship well.
God restore you to health!
I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it!
Come, neighbor.
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
Farewell, my lords.
We look for you tomorrow.
We will not fail.
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.
Bring you these fellows on.
We’ll talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it, for in most comely truth thou deservest it.
To have no man come over me!
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches.
And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit but hurt not.
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a woman.
And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice.
I give thee the bucklers.
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
And therefore will come.
Yea, Signior, and depart when you bid me.
Oh, stay but till then!
“Then” is spoken.
Fare you well now.
And yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came, which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome.
Therefore I will depart unkissed.
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.
For them all together, which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them.
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
Suffer love!
A good epithet!
I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.
In spite of your heart, I think.
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
It appears not in this confession.
There’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbors.
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.
And how long is that, think you?
Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.
Very ill.
And how do you?
Very ill, too.
Serve God, love me, and mend.
There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste.
Madam, you must come to your uncle.
Yonder’s old coil at home.
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone.
Will you come presently?
Will you go hear this news, Signior?
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes and moreover, I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.
Is this the monument of Leonato?
It is, my lord.
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies.
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.
So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame.
Good morrow, masters.
Put your torches out.
The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us.
Fare you well.
Good morrow, masters.
Each his several way.
Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds, And then to Leonato’s we will go.
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed ’s Than this for whom we rendered up this woe.
Did I not tell you she was innocent?
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated.
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
And so am I, being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
Which I will do with confirmed countenance.
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
To do what, Signior?
To bind me or undo me, one of them.
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good Signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.
That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince.
But what’s your will?
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.
My heart is with your liking.
And my help.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
Good morrow to this fair assembly.
Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.
We here attend you.
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.
Call her forth, brother.
Here’s the friar ready.
Good morrow, Benedick.
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low, And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow And got a calf in that same noble feat Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
For this I owe you.
Here comes other reck'nings.
This same is she, and I do give you her.
Why, then she’s mine.
Sweet, let me see your face.
No, that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her.
Give me your hand before this holy friar.
I am your husband, if you like of me.
Another Hero!
Nothing certainer.
The former Hero!
Hero that is dead!
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
Soft and fair, Friar.
Which is Beatrice?
I answer to that name.
What is your will?
Do not you love me?
Why no, no more than reason.
Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived.
They swore you did.
Do not you love me?
Troth, no, no more than reason.
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
They swore that you were well nigh dead for me.
'Tis no such matter.
Then you do not love me?
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her, For here’s a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashioned to Beatrice.
And here’s another, Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol'n from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.
A miracle!
Here’s our own hands against our hearts.
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
Peace!
I will stop your mouth.
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
I’ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humor.
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?
No.
If a man will be beaten with brains, he shall wear nothing handsome about him.
Come, come, we are friends.
We’ll have dancing afterward.
First, of my word!
Therefore play, music.
Prince, thou art sad.
Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.
There is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight And brought with armed men back to Messina.
Think not on him till tomorrow.
I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him.
Strike up, pipers.
Tush!
Never tell me.
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
'Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!
If ever I did dream of such a matter, abhor me.
Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate.
Despise me If I do not.
Three great ones of the city    Off capped to him, and by the faith of man I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
Why, there’s no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.
I would not follow him then.
O sir, content you.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly followed.
What a full fortune does the Thick lips owe If he can carry’t thus!
Call up her father.
Rouse him.
Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.
What, ho, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!
Awake!
What, ho, Brabantio!
Thieves!
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?
Signior, is all your family within?
Are your doors locked?
Why, wherefore ask you this?
Zounds, sir, you’re robbed!
For shame, put on your gown.
What, have you lost your wits?
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
Not I.
What are you?
My name is Roderigo.
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee.
And now in madness, Being full of supper and distempering drafts, Upon malicious knavery dost thou come To start my quiet?
Sir, sir, sir
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee.
Patience, good sir.
What tell’st thou me of robbing?
This is Venice, My house is not a grange.
Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse.
You’ll have your nephews neigh to you.
You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
What profane wretch art thou?
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
Thou art a villain!
You are a senator!
This thou shalt answer.
I know thee, Roderigo.
Sir, I will answer any thing.
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper, call up all my people!
Farewell, for I must leave you.
It is too true an evil.
Gone she is.
And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness.
Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?
Oh, unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say’st thou?
Truly, I think they are.
Oh, heaven, how got she out?
Oh, treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act.
Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused?
Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Call up my brother Oh, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another.
Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard and go along with me.
Pray you lead on.
At every house I’ll call.
Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o' th' conscience To do no contrived murder.
I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service.
Nine or ten times I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs.
'Tis better as it is.
Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him.
But I pray you, sir, Are you fast married?
Be assured of this: That the Magnifico is much beloved And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke’s.
He will divorce you, Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law    Will give him cable.
Let him do his spite.
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out tongue his complaints.
Those are the raisèd father and his friends.
You were best go in.
Not I, I must be found.
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly.
By Janus, I think no.
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?
What’s the matter, think you?
Something from Cyprus as I may divine.
It is a business of some heat.
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.
Ancient, what makes he here?
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.
If it prove lawful prize, he’s made for ever.
I do not understand.
He’s married.
To who?
Marry, to
Have with you.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
It is Brabantio.
General, be advised, He comes to bad intent.
Holla!
Stand there!
Signior, it is the Moor.
Down with him, thief!
You, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I am for you.
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons.
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter?
Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!
Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining and the rest.
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter.
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?
To prison, till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer.
What if I do obey?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him?
'Tis true, most worthy signior.
The Duke’s in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
How?
The Duke in council?
In this time of the night?
Bring him away.
Mine’s not an idle cause.
The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.
For if such actions may have passage free, Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
There’s no composition in this news That gives them credit.
Indeed, they are disproportioned.
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
And mine a hundred and forty.
And mine, two hundred.
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.
What, ho, what, ho, what, ho!
A messenger from the galleys.
Now, what’s the business?
How say you by this change?
This cannot be, By no assay of reason.
'Tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze.
Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.
Here is more news.
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
Ay, so I thought.
How many, as you guess?
Of thirty sail.
And now they do re stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus.
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.
'Tis certain then for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
He’s now in Florence.
Write from us to him.
Post post haste, dispatch.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman   I did not see you.
Welcome, gentle signior.
We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.
So did I yours.
Good your grace, pardon me.
Why, what’s the matter?
My daughter!
Oh, my daughter!
Dead?
Ay, to me.
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks.
For nature so prepost'rously to err, Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, Sans witchcraft could not.
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.
Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems, Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought.
We are very sorry for’t.
What, in your own part, can you say to this?
A maiden never bold, Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself.
But, Othello, speak.
Did you by indirect and forcèd courses Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?
I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary, And let her speak of me before her father.
If you do find me foul in her report The trust, the office I do hold of you, Not only take away, but let your sentence Even fall upon my life.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
Ancient, conduct them.
You best know the place.
Say it, Othello.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
I pray you, hear her speak.
If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man.
Come hither, gentle mistress.
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience?
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty.
To you I am bound for life and education.
My life and education both do learn me How to respect you.
You are the lord of duty.
I am hitherto your daughter.
God be with you.
I have done.
Please it your grace, on to the state affairs.
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor.
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee.
For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child.
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers Into your favor.
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down.
I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness, and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife.
Due reference of place and exhibition, With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding.
Why, at her father’s.
I’ll not have it so.
Nor I.
Nor would I there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye.
What would you, Desdemona?
That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world.
My heart’s subdued Even to the very quality of my lord.
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
Let her have your voice.
Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going.
Th' affair cries haste And speed must answer it.
You must away tonight.
With all my heart.
At nine i' th' morning here we’ll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you, And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you.
Let it be so.
Good night to every one.
And, noble signior, If virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son in law is far more fair than black.
Adieu, brave Moor.
Use Desdemona well.
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.
She has deceived her father, and may thee.
My life upon her faith!
Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage.
Iago.
What say’st thou, noble heart?
What will I do, think’st thou?
Why, go to bed, and sleep.
I will incontinently drown myself.
If thou dost I shall never love thee after.
Why, thou silly gentleman!
Oh, villainous!
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself.
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
Virtue?
A fig!
'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners.
It cannot be.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will.
Come, be a man.
Drown thyself?
Drown cats and blind puppies!
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.
I could never better stead thee than now.
Put money in thy purse.
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
Thou art sure of me.
Go, make money.
I have told thee often, and I re tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
My cause is hearted.
Thine hath no less reason.
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.
Where shall we meet i' th' morning?
At my lodging.
I’ll be with thee betimes.
Go to, farewell.
Do you hear, Roderigo?
What say you?
No more of drowning, do you hear?
I am changed.
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse.
I’ll sell all my land.
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit.
I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He has done my office.
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
Nothing at all.
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.
It is impossible they bear it out.
News, lads, Our wars are done!
How?
Is this true?
The ship is here put in, A Veronesa.
Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore.
The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
I am glad on ’t.
'Tis a worthy governor.
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe.
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest.
Come, let’s do so.
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor.
Is he well shipped?
A sail, a sail, a sail!
What noise?
The town is empty.
On the brow o' th' sea Stand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
They do discharge their shot of courtesy.
Our friends at least.
I pray you sir, go forth And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.
I shall.
But good lieutenant, is your general wived?
Most fortunately.
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
He’s had most favorable and happy speed.
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The guttered rocks and congregated sands, Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel, As having sense of beauty, do omit Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona.
What is she?
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
He is not yet arrived.
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here.
Oh, but I fear.
How lost you company?
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship
A sail, a sail!
But, hark!
a sail.
They give this greeting to the citadel.
This likewise is a friend.
See for the news.
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You would have have enough.
Alas, she has no speech!
In faith, too much.
I find it still, when I have leave to sleep.
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.
You have little cause to say so.
Come on, come on.
You are pictures out of door, Bells in your parlors, wild cats in your kitchens, Saints in your injuries, devils being offended, Players in your housewifery, and hussies in your beds.
Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!
You shall not write my praise.
No, let me not.
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou should’st praise me?
Come on, assay.
There’s one gone to the harbor?
Ay, madam.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
Well praised!
How if she be black and witty?
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
Worse and worse!
How if fair and foolish?
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' th' alehouse.
What miserable praise hast thou for her That’s foul and foolish?
There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto, But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
Oh, heavy ignorance!
Thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
To do what?
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion!
Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.
How say you, Cassio?
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?
He speaks home, madam.
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
He takes her by the palm.
Ay, well said, whisper!
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio.
'Tis truly so.
Let’s meet him and receive him.
Lo, where he comes!
Oh my fair warrior!
My dear Othello!
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me.
Oh, my soul’s joy!
If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have wakened death, And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high, and duck again as low As hell’s from heaven!
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here, it is too much of joy.
And this, and this, the greatest discords be    That e'er our hearts shall make!
Oh, you are well tuned now, But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am.
Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends!
Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.
Come hither.
If thou be’st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me.
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.
First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
With him?
Why, ’tis not possible.
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies.
To love him still for prating?
Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil?
When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties.
All which the Moor is defective in.
Now for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor.
Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice.
I cannot believe that in her.
She’s full of most blessed condition.
Blessed fig’s end!
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.
If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor.
Yes, that I did, but that was but courtesy.
Lechery, by this hand, an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!
When these mutabilities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th' incorporate conclusion.
Pish!
But, sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.
Watch you tonight for the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.
Cassio knows you not.
I’ll not be far from you.
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
Well.
Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you.
Provoke him that he may.
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.
I warrant thee.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
Farewell.
Adieu.
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.
That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband.
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop Not to outsport discretion.
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night.
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.
Welcome, Iago.
We must to the watch.
She’s a most exquisite lady.
And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.
What an eye she has!
Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.
An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
She is indeed perfection.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.
Not tonight, good Iago.
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
Oh, they are our friends.
But one cup.
I’ll drink for you.
What, man, ’tis a night of revels!
The gallants desire it.
Where are they?
Here at the door.
I pray you call them in.
I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.
Now my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottle deep, and he’s to watch.
'Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.
Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier.
Some wine, ho!
Fore heaven, an excellent song.
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting.
Your Dane, your German, and your swag bellied Hollander Drink, ho!
are nothing to your English.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain.
To the health of our general!
I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice.
Oh, sweet England!
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
Will you hear ’t again?
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.
Well, heaven’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
It’s true, good lieutenant.
For mine own part, no offence to the general nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.
And so do I too, lieutenant.
Ay, but    not before me.
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.
Let’s have no more of this, let’s to our affairs.
Forgive us our sins!
Gentlemen, let’s look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk.
Excellent well!
Why, very well then.
You must not think then that I am drunk.
To th' platform, masters.
Come, let’s set the watch.
But is he often thus?
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
He’ll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle.
It were well The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils.
Is not this true?
How now, Roderigo?
I pray you, after the lieutenant, go!
And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity.
It were an honest action to say
But, hark!
What noise?
Zounds!
You rogue!
You rascal!
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
A knave teach me my duty?
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
Beat me?
Dost thou prate, rogue?
Nay, good lieutenant!
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o'er the mazzard.
Come, come, you're drunk.
Drunk?
Away, I say, go out, and cry a mutiny.
What is the matter here?
Hold, for your lives!
Hold, ho!
Lieutenant sir, Montano gentlemen, Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold!
The general speaks to you.
Hold, for shame!
Why, how now, ho!
From whence ariseth this?
Are we turned Turks?
And to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light, he dies upon his motion.
I do not know.
Friends all but now, even now, In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom Divesting them for bed.
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
I pray you pardon me, I cannot speak.
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
Your officer Iago can inform you, While I spare speech, which something now offends me, Of all that I do know.
Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, Unless self charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.
Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way.
If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier.
Touch me not so near.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.
This it is, general: Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him.
Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause, Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamor as it so fell out  The town might fall in fright.
I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio.
Cassio, I love thee But never more be officer of mine.
What’s the matter, dear?
All’s well, sweeting, Come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts Myself will be your surgeon.
Lead him off.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Ay, past all surgery.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
Oh, I have lost my reputation!
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound.
There is more sense in that than in reputation.
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.
What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?
I know not.
Is ’t possible?
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly.
A quarrel, but nothing wherefore.
Oh, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!
That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
Why, but you are now well enough.
How came you thus recovered?
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath.
One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
Come, you are too severe a moraler.
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard.
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast!
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.
Exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
I have well approved it, sir.
I drunk!
You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man.
I tell you what you shall do.
Our general’s wife is now the general.
I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces.
Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again.
You advise me well.
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.
You are in the right.
Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.
Good night, honest Iago.
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry.
My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains.
And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does’t not go well?
Cassio hath beaten thee.
And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile.
In troth, ’tis morning.
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.
Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone.
Masters, play here, I will content your pains.
Something that’s brief, and bid “Good morrow, general.
How, sir?
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
Well, sir, we will not.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to ’t again.
But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
We have none such, sir.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away.
Go, vanish into air, away!
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
No, I hear not your honest friend, I hear you.
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
There’s a poor piece of gold for thee.
She is stirring, sir.
If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.
In happy time, Iago.
You have not been abed, then?
Why, no.
The day had broke Before we parted.
I have made bold, Iago, To send in to your wife.
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.
I humbly thank you for’t.
Good morrow, good Lieutenant.
I am sorry For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly.
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you.
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again.
Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone.
Pray you come in.
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.
I am much bound to you.
Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?
We’ll wait upon your lordship.
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.
Good madam, do.
I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his.
Oh, that’s an honest fellow.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He’s never anything but your true servant.
I know ’t, I thank you.
You do love my lord.
Do not doubt that.
Madam, here comes my lord.
Madam, I’ll take my leave.
Why, stay and hear me speak.
Madam, not now.
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.
Well, do your discretion.
Ha!
I like not that.
What dost thou say?
Nothing, my lord, or if I know not what.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
Cassio, my lord?
I do believe ’twas he.
How now, my lord?
I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.
Who is ’t you mean?
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.
Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take.
For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face.
I prithee, call him back.
Went he hence now?
Not now, sweet Desdemona.
Some other time.
The sooner, sweet, for you.
Shall ’t be tonight at supper?
No, not tonight.
Tomorrow dinner, then?
I shall not dine at home, I meet the captains at the citadel.
Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn.
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.
I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days.
Prithee, no more.
Let him come when he will, I will deny thee nothing.
I will deny thee nothing!
Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself.
Shall I deny you?
No.
Farewell, my lord.
Farewell, my Desdemona.
I’ll come to thee straight.
Emilia, come.
Be as your fancies teach you.
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Excellent wretch!
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee!
And when I love thee not Chaos is come again.
My noble lord
What dost thou say, Iago?
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?
Why of thy thought, Iago?
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
Oh, yes, and went between us very oft.
Indeed?
Indeed?
Ay, indeed!
Discern’st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
Honest, my lord?
Honest, ay, honest.
My lord, for aught I know.
What dost thou think?
Think, my lord?
My lord, you know I love you.
I think thou dost.
And for I know thou 'rt full of love and honesty And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.
For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom, but in a man that’s just They are close dilations, working from the heart, That passion cannot rule.
For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.
I think so too.
Certain, men should be what they seem.
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Nay, yet there’s more in this.
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.
What dost thou mean?
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash.
'Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.
I’ll know thy thoughts.
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.
Ha!
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on.
That cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger, But, oh, what damnèd minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts  suspects, yet soundly loves!
Oh, misery!
Why, why is this?
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions?
No!
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved.
I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit.
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.
I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio.
Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.
I would not have your free and noble nature Out of self bounty be abused.
Look to ’t.
I know our country disposition well.
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands.
Dost thou say so?
She did deceive her father, marrying you, And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most.
And so she did.
Why, go to then.
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak, He thought ’twas witchcraft.
But I am much to blame.
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you.
I am bound to thee forever.
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
Not a jot, not a jot.
Trust me, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love.
But I do see you’re moved.
I will not.
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at.
Cassio’s my worthy friend  My lord, I see you’re moved.
No, not much moved.
I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.
And yet how nature, erring from itself
Ay, there’s the point.
Farewell, farewell.
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.
Set on thy wife to observe.
Leave me, Iago.
My lord, I take my leave.
Why did I marry?
My lord, I would I might entreat your honor To scan this thing no farther.
Leave it to time.
Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place, For sure, he fills it up with great ability, Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity.
Much will be seen in that.
In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears  As worthy cause I have to fear I am  And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
Fear not my government.
I once more take my leave.
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities, with a learnèd spirit, Of human dealings.
If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune.
How now, my dear Othello?
Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence.
I am to blame.
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?
I have a pain upon my forehead, here.
Why that’s with watching, ’twill away again.
Your napkin is too little, Let it alone.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
How now!
What do you here alone?
Do not you chide.
I have a thing for you.
A thing for me?
It is a common thing
Ha?
To have a foolish wife.
Oh, is that all?
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.
Hast stolen it from her?
A good wench, give it me.
Why, what is that to you?
If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again.
Poor lady, she’ll run mad When she shall lack it.
Be not acknown on ’t, I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
Ha!
Ha!
False to me?
Why, how now, general?
No more of that.
Avaunt!
Be gone!
Thou hast set me on the rack.
I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little.
How now, my lord!
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw ’t not, thought it not, it harmed not me.
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
I am sorry to hear this.
I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.
Oh, now forever Farewell the tranquil mind!
Farewell content!
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue!
Oh, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit stirring drum, th' ear piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove’s dead clamors counterfeit, Farewell!
Othello’s occupation’s gone.
Is ’t possible, my lord?
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, Be sure of it.
Is ’t come to this?
My noble lord
Oh, grace!
Oh, heaven forgive me!
Are you a man?
Have you a soul or sense?
God buy you, take mine office.
O wretched fool That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world!
Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe.
Nay, stay.
Thou shouldst be honest.
I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for.
By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not.
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I’ll have some proof.
Her name, that was as fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face.
If there be cords or knives, Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I’ll not endure it.
Would I were satisfied!
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
Would?
And may, but how?
How satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?
Death and damnation!
Oh!
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.
I do not like the office.
But, sith I am entered in this cause so far, Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love, I will go on.
I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter Their affairs.
One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona, Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.
” And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cry “O sweet creature!
Oh, monstrous!
Monstrous!
Nay, this was but his dream.
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.
I’ll tear her all to pieces!
I gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.
I know not that, but such a handkerchief  I am sure it was your wife’s did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with.
If it be that
If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs.
Yet be content.
Oh, blood, blood, blood!
Patience, I say.
Your mind may change.
Never, Iago.
Do not rise yet.
Witness, you ever burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wronged Othello’s service.
Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive.
My friend is dead, 'Tis done at your request.
But let her live.
Damn her, lewd minx!
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Come, go with me apart.
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.
Now art thou my lieutenant.
I am your own for ever.
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
Why, man?
He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing.
Go to.
Where lodges he?
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
Can anything be made of this?
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.
Seek him, bid him come hither.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
I know not, madam.
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes.
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.
Is he not jealous?
Who, he?
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.
Look where he comes.
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him.
How is ’t with you, my lord?
Well, my good lady.
Oh, hardness to dissemble!
How do you, Desdemona?
Well, my good lord.
Give me your hand.
This hand is moist, my lady.
It hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
You may indeed say so, For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
I cannot speak of this.
Come now, your promise.
What promise, chuck?
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.
Lend me thy handkerchief.
Here, my lord.
That which I gave you.
I have it not about me.
Not?
No, indeed, my lord.
That’s a fault.
That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give, She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people.
She told her, while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made gift of it, my father’s eye Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt After new fancies.
She, dying, gave it me And bid me, when my fate would have me wived, To give it her.
I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye.
To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition As nothing else could match.
Is ’t possible?
'Tis true.
There’s magic in the web of it.
A sibyl, that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sewed the work.
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens' hearts.
Indeed?
Is ’t true?
Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!
Ha!
Wherefore?
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
Is ’t lost?
Is ’t gone?
Speak, is ’t out o' th' way?
Bless us!
Say you?
It is not lost, but what and if it were?
How!
I say, it is not lost.
Fetch ’t, let me see ’t.
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives.
The handkerchief!
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, Shared dangers with you
The handkerchief!
In sooth, you are to blame.
Zounds!
Is not this man jealous?
I ne'er saw this before.
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food.
There is no other way.
'Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness!
Go and importune her.
How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?
Madam, my former suit.
I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist, and be a member of his love Whom I, with all the office of my heart Entirely honor.
I would not be delayed.
If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, Nor purposed merit in futurity, Can ransom me into his love again, But to know so must be my benefit.
So shall I clothe me in a forced content, And shut myself up in some other course, To fortune’s alms.
Alas, thrice gentle Cassio, My advocation is not now in tune.
Is my lord angry?
He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness.
Can he be angry?
I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And, like the devil, from his very arm Puffed his own brother  and is he angry?
Something of moment then, I will go meet him.
There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry.
I prithee, do so.
Alas the day!
I never gave him cause.
But jealous souls will not be answered so.
They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they’re jealous.
It is a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!
Lady, amen.
I will go seek him.
Cassio, walk hereabout.
If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Save you, friend Cassio!
What make you from home?
How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?
Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away?
Seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours?
And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times!
Oh weary reckoning!
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend!
To the felt absence now I feel a cause.
Is ’t come to this?
Well, well.
Why, whose is it?
Leave you!
Wherefore?
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.
Why, I pray you?
Not that I love you not.
But that you do not love me.
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here.
But I’ll see you soon.
'Tis very good.
Will you think so?
Think so, Iago?
What, To kiss in private?
An unauthorized kiss!
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief
What then?
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
Her honor is an essence that’s not seen, They have it very oft that have it not.
But for the handkerchief
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Ay, what of that?
That’s not so good now.
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say as knaves be such abroad, Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab
Hath he said any thing?
He hath, my lord, but be you well assured No more than he’ll unswear.
What hath he said?
Why, that he did I know not what he did.
What?
what?
Lie
With her?
With her, on her, what you will.
Lie with her?
lie on her?
We say “lie on her” when they belie her!
Lie with her that’s fulsome.
Handkerchief confessions handkerchief!
To confess, and be hanged for his labor.
First to be hanged, and then to confess I tremble at it .
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some
Work on, My medicine, work!
Thus credulous fools are caught, And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach.
What, ho!
My lord!
My lord, I say!
Othello!
What’s the matter?
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
This is his second fit.
He had one yesterday.
Rub him about the temples.
No, forbear.
The lethargy must have his quiet course.
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness.
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while, He will recover straight.
Dost thou mock me?
I mock you not, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
There’s many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster.
Did he confess it?
Oh, thou art wise!
Stand you awhile apart, Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Dost thou hear, Iago?
That’s not amiss, But yet keep time in all.
Will you withdraw?
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.
Alas, poor caitiff!
Look how he laughs already!
Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves me.
Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
Do you hear, Cassio?
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.
Go to, well said, well said.
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
Do you intend it?
Ha, ha, ha!
Do ye triumph, Roman?
Do you triumph?
I marry her!
What?
So, so, so, so!
They laugh that win!
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
Prithee say true!
I am a very villain else.
Have you scored me?
Well.
This is the monkey’s own giving out.
She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
Iago beckons me.
Now he begins the story.
She was here even now.
She haunts me in every place.
I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck
Crying “O dear Cassio!
” as it were.
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes, and pulls me!
Ha, ha, ha!
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.
Oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
Well, I must leave her company.
Before me!
Look, where she comes.
'Tis such another fitchew.
Marry, a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it.
I must take out the work?
A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work?
There, give it your hobby horse.
Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.
How now, my sweet Bianca!
How now, how now?
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may.
After her, after her.
I must, she’ll rail in the street else.
Will you sup there?
Yes, I intend so.
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.
Prithee come, will you?
Go to!
Say no more.
How shall I murder him, Iago?
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
Oh Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?
Was that mine?
Yours by this hand.
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
I would have him nine years a killing.
A fine woman!
A fair woman!
A sweet woman!
Nay, you must forget that.
Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned tonight, for she shall not live.
No, my heart is turned to stone.
I strike it and it hurts my hand.
Nay, that’s not your way.
Hang her!
I do but say what she is.
So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician.
Oh, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!
She’s the worse for all this.
Oh, a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition!
Ay, too gentle.
Nay, that’s certain.
But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
I will chop her into messes!
Cuckold me?
Oh, ’tis foul in her.
With mine officer!
That’s fouler.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night, Iago!
Do it not with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
Good, good, the justice of it pleases!
Very good!
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
You shall hear more by midnight.
Excellent good.
I warrant something from Venice.
'Tis Lodovico, this, comes from the duke.
See, your wife’s with him.
Save you, worthy general!
With all my heart, sir.
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?
I am very glad to see you, signior.
Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you.
How does lieutenant Cassio?
Lives, sir.
Are you sure of that?
My lord?
“This fail you not to do, as you will ”
He did not call, he’s busy in the paper.
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one.
I would do much T' atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
Fire and brimstone!
My lord?
Are you wise?
What, is he angry?
By my troth, I am glad on ’t.
Indeed!
My lord?
I am glad to see you mad.
Why, sweet Othello
Devil!
I have not deserved this.
Oh, devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!
I will not stay to offend you.
Truly, an obedient lady.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
Mistress!
My lord?
What would you with her, sir?
Who, I, my lord?
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again.
And she can weep, sir, weep.
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient.
Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir     Oh, well painted passion!
I am commanded home.
Get you away, I’ll send for you anon.
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient?
Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake?
Whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce?
He is much changed.
Are his wits safe?
Is he not light of brain?
He’s that he is.
I may not breathe my censure What he might be.
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!
What?
Strike his wife?
'Faith, that was not so well.
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new create his fault?
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.
You shall observe him, And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech.
Do but go after And mark how he continues.
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
You have seen nothing then?
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.
What, did they never whisper?
Never, my lord.
Nor send you out o' th' way?
Never.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
Never, my lord.
That’s strange.
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake.
If you think other Remove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom.
Bid her come hither.
Go.
My lord, what is your will?
Pray you, chuck, come hither.
What is your pleasure?
Let me see your eyes.
Look in my face.
What horrible fancy’s this?
Some of your function, mistress, Leave procreants alone and shut the door.
Cough or cry “hem” if any body come.
Your mystery, your mystery!
Nay, dispatch!
Why, what art thou?
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.
Heaven doth truly know it.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
To whom, my lord?
With whom?
How am I false?
Ah, Desdemona, away, away, away!
Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
Oh, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing.
O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write “whore” upon?
What committed?
Committed?
O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks That would to cinders burn up modesty Did I but speak thy deeds.
What committed?
By heaven, you do me wrong!
Are you not a strumpet?
No, as I am a Christian.
What, not a whore?
No, as I shall be saved.
Is ’t possible?
Oh, heaven forgive us!
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam?
How do you, my good lady?
Faith, half asleep.
Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?
With who?
Why, with my lord, madam.
Who is thy lord?
He that is yours, sweet lady.
I have none.
Do not talk to me, Emilia.
I cannot weep, nor answers have I none, But what should go by water.
Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.
Remember, And call thy husband hither.
Here’s a change indeed!
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse?
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is ’t with you?
I cannot tell.
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
What is the matter, lady?
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, That true hearts cannot bear it.
Am I that name, Iago?
What name, fair lady?
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
He called her “whore.
” A beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
Why did he so?
I do not know.
I am sure I am none such.
Do not weep, do not weep.
Alas the day!
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called “whore”?
Would it not make one weep?
It is my wretched fortune.
Beshrew him for ’t!
How comes this trick upon him?
Nay, heaven doth know.
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander.
I will be hanged else!
Fie, there is no such man.
It is impossible.
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
Speak within door.
Oh, fie upon them!
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
You are a fool.
Go to.
Alas Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him.
For, by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him.
Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them, or any other form, Or that I do not yet, and ever did, And ever will  though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement love him dearly, Comfort forswear me!
I pray you, be content, ’tis but his humor.
If ’twere no other
'Tis but so, I warrant.
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me.
What in the contrary?
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.
You charge me most unjustly.
With naught but truth.
I have wasted myself out of my means.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress.
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
Well, go to.
“Very well,” “go to”!
I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well.
Very well.
I tell you ’tis not very well.
I will make myself known to Desdemona.
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation.
If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
You have said now.
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before.
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
It hath not appeared.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and compass?
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.
Is that true?
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
How do you mean, removing of him?
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.
And that you would have me to do!
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune.
If you will watch his going thence    you may take him at your pleasure.
I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us.
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me.
I will hear further reason for this.
And you shall be satisfied.
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
Oh, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.
Madam, good night.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Your honor is most welcome.
Will you walk, sir?
O Desdemona
My lord?
I will, my lord.
How goes it now?
He looks gentler than he did.
He says he will return incontinent, And hath commanded me to go to bed And bid me to dismiss you.
Dismiss me?
It was his bidding.
Therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
We must not now displease him.
Ay.
Would you had never seen him!
So would not I.
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns  Prithee, unpin me have grace and favor.
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
All’s one.
Good Father, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of these same sheets.
Come, come!
You talk!
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
A very handsome man.
He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
'Tis neither here nor there.
I have heard it said so.
Oh, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think tell me, Emilia  That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?
There be some such, no question.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Why, would not you?
No, by this heavenly light!
Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
The world’s a huge thing.
It is a great price for a small vice.
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I had done.
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.
But for the whole world?
Why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?
I should venture purgatory for ’t.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world.
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world, and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
I do not think there is any such woman.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall.
Say that they slack their duties And pour our treasures into foreign laps, Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us.
Or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite.
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them.
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have.
What is it that they do When they change us for others?
Is it sport?
I think it is.
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.
Is ’t frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.
And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Good night, good night.
Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
Be near at hand, I may miscarry in ’t.
Here, at thy hand.
Be bold, and take thy stand.
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth, my sword: he dies.
I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense, And he grows angry.
Now, whether he kill Cassio Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, Every way makes my gain.
Live Roderigo, He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him As gifts to Desdemona.
It must not be.
If Cassio do remain He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly.
And besides, the Moor May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.
But so, I hear him coming.
I know his gait, ’tis he.
Villain, thou diest!
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed But that my coat is better than thou know’st I will make proof of thine.
Oh, I am slain!
I am maimed for ever.
Help, ho!
Murder!
Murder!
The voice of Cassio.
Iago keeps his word.
Oh, villain that I am!
It is even so.
Oh, help, ho!
Light!
A surgeon!
'Tis he.
Oh, brave Iago, honest and just, That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!
Thou teachest me.
Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies.
Strumpet, I come.
For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.
Thy bed, lust stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.
What, ho!
No watch?
No passage?
Murder!
Murder!
'Tis some mischance, the cry is very direful.
Oh, help!
Hark!
Oh, wretched villain!
Two or three groan.
'Tis heavy night, These may be counterfeits.
Let’s think ’t unsafe To come in to the cry without more help.
Nobody come?
Then shall I bleed to death.
Hark!
Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
Who’s there?
Whose noise is this that ones on murder?
We do not know.
Do not you hear a cry?
Here, here!
For heaven’s sake, help me!
What’s the matter?
This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.
The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.
What are you here that cry so grievously?
Iago?
Oh, I am spoiled, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
Oh, me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?
I think that one of them is hereabout, And cannot make away.
Oh, treacherous villains!
What are you there?
Come in, and give some help.
Oh, help me there!
That’s one of them.
O murd'rous slave!
O villain!
O damned Iago!
O inhuman dog!
As you shall prove us, praise us.
Signior Lodovico?
He, sir.
I cry you mercy.
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.
Cassio!
How is ’t, brother!
My leg is cut in two.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen, I’ll bind it with my shirt.
What is the matter, ho?
Who is ’t that cried?
Who is ’t that cried?
Oh, my dear Cassio!
My sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
O notable strumpet!
Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
No.
I am sorry to find you thus.
I have been to seek you.
Lend me a garter.
So.
Oh, for a chair, To bear him easily hence!
Alas, he faints!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio.
Come, come, Lend me a light.
Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo!
No yes, sure!
Yes, ’tis Roderigo.
What, of Venice?
Even he, sir.
Did you know him?
Know him?
Ay.
Signior Gratiano?
I am glad to see you.
How do you, Cassio?
Oh, a chair, a chair!
Roderigo!
None in the world, nor do I know the man.
What, look you pale?
Oh, bear him out o' the air.
Alas, what is the matter?
What is the matter, husband?
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are ’scaped.
He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
Alas, good gentleman!
Alas, good Cassio!
This is the fruits of whoring.
Prithee, Emilia, Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight.
What, do you shake at that?
He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.
Oh, did he so?
I charge you, go with me.
Oh, fie upon thee, strumpet!
As I!
Fie upon thee!
Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.
Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.
Will you go on afore?
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars, It is the cause.
Yet I’ll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me.
But once put out thy light, Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume.
When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again, It must needs wither.
I’ll smell thee on the tree.
Oh, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword!
One more, one more.
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee And love thee after.
One more, and that’s the last.
So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
I must weep, But they are cruel tears.
This sorrow’s heavenly, It strikes where it doth love.
She wakes.
Who’s there?
Othello?
Ay, Desdemona.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?
Ay, my lord.
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, Solicit for it straight.
Alack, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Well, do it, and be brief.
I will walk by.
I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.
Talk you of killing?
Ay, I do.
Then heaven Have mercy on me!
Amen, with all my heart.
If you say, I hope you will not kill me.
Humh!
And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then When your eyes roll so.
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.
But yet I feel I fear.
Think on thy sins.
They are loves I bear to you.
Ay, and for that thou diest.
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope They do not point on me.
Peace, and be still.
I will so.
What’s the matter?
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee, thou gav’st To Cassio.
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.
Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed.
Ay but not yet to die!
Presently.
Oh, heaven have mercy on me!
I say “amen.
And have you mercy too!
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.
He found it then, I never gave it him.
Send for him hither, Let him confess a truth.
He hath confessed.
What, my lord?
That he hath usèd thee.
How?
Unlawfully?
Ay.
He will not say so.
No, his mouth is stopped.
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for ’t.
Oh!
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
Out, strumpet!
weep’st thou for him to my face?
Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
Down, strumpet!
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight!
Nay, if you strive
But half an hour!
Being done, there is no pause.
But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
My lord , my lord!
What, ho!
My lord, my lord!
What noise is this?
Not dead?
Not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful, I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
What, ho!
My lord, my lord!
Who’s there?
O good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
Yes, ’tis Emilia.
By and by.
She’s dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death, The noise was high.
Ha!
No more moving?
Still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
Were ’t good?
I think she stirs again No.
What’s best to do?
I do beseech you That I may speak with you, O good my lord!
I had forgot thee Oh, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by.
Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
O my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!
What, now?
But now, my lord.
Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo.
Roderigo killed?
And Cassio killed!
No, Cassio is not killed.
Not Cassio killed!
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
Oh, falsely, falsely murdered!
Alas, what cry is that?
That?
What?
Out and alas, that was my lady’s voice.
A guiltless death I die.
Oh, who hath done this deed?
Nobody.
I myself.
Farewell.
Commend me to my kind lord.
Oh, farewell!
Why, how should she be murdered?
Alas, who knows?
You heard her say herself it was not I.
She said so.
I must needs report the truth.
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell.
'Twas I that killed her.
Oh, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!
She turned to folly, and she was a whore.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
She was false as water.
Thou art rash as fire, To say that she was false.
Oh, she was heavenly true!
Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else.
Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.
Thy husband knew it all.
My husband!
Thy husband.
That she was false to wedlock?
Ay, with Cassio.
My husband?
Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds.
My husband!
What needs this iterance, woman?
I say thy husband.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!
He, woman.
I say “thy husband” dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day!
He lies to th' heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
Ha!
Do thy worst.
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her.
Peace, you were best.
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt.
O gull!
O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt!
What is the matter?
How now, general?
Oh, are you come, Iago?
You have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck.
What is the matter?
Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.
He says thou told’st him that his wife was false.
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.
I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true.
But did you ever tell him she was false?
I did.
You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie.
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!
Did you say with Cassio?
With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.
I will not charm my tongue, I am bound to speak.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed
Oh, heavens forfend!
And your reports have set the murder on.
Nay, stare not, masters, it is true, indeed.
'Tis a strange truth.
Oh, monstrous act!
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think upon ’t, I think I smell ’t, Oh, villainy!
I thought so then, I’ll kill myself for grief.
Oh, villainy, villainy!
What, are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye.
Oh, she was foul!
Poor Desdemon!
'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed.
Cassio confessed it, And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her.
Oh, heaven!
Oh, heavenly powers!
Zounds, hold your peace.
' Twill out, ’twill out.
I peace?
No, I will speak as liberal as the north.
Be wise, and get you home.
I will not.
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
O thou dull Moor!
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband.
Villainous whore!
She give it Cassio?
Filth, thou liest!
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb!
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife?
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder?
The woman falls!
Sure he hath killed his wife.
Ay, ay.
Oh, lay me by my mistress' side.
He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.
'Tis a notorious villain.
Take you this weapon, Which I have recovered from the Moor.
Come, guard the door without.
Let him not pass, But kill him rather.
I am not valiant neither, But ever puny whipster gets my sword.
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me?
I will play the swan.
If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
What is the matter?
Behold, I have a weapon.
A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier’s thigh.
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
That’s he that was Othello.
Here I am.
Where is that viper?
Bring the villain forth.
Wrench his sword from him.
I bleed, sir, but not killed.
I am not sorry neither.
I’d have thee live, For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.
O thou Othello, thou was once so good, Fall'n in the practice of a cursèd slave, What shall be said to thee?
Why, anything.
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?
Ay.
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
Demand me nothing.
What you know, you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
What, not to pray?
Torments will ope your lips.
Well, thou dost best.
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, Which, as I think, you know not.
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, And here another.
Oh, villain!
Most heathenish and most gross!
O thou pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife’s?
I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.
O fool!
fool!
fool!
There is besides in Roderigo’s letter How he upbraids Iago, that he made him Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came That I was cast.
And even but now he spake, After long seeming dead Iago hurt him, Iago set him on.
You must forsake this room and go with us.
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus.
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his.
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state.
Come, bring him away.
Soft you, a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know ’t.
No more of that.
I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am.
Nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.
Oh, bloody period!
All that is spoke is marred.
I kissed thee ere I killed thee.
No way but this, Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon, For he was great of heart.
O Spartan dog, More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea, Look on the tragic loading of this bed.
This is thy work.
The object poisons sight, Let it be hid.
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received The danger of the task you undertake.
Prince Pericles,
That would be son to great Antiochus.
Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
Like a bold champion, I assume the lists, Nor ask advice of any other thought But faithfulness and courage.
I am no viper, yet I feed On mother's flesh which did me breed.
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
For that's an article within our law, As dangerous as the rest.
Your time's expired: Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
Great king, Few love to hear the sins they love to act; 'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Heaven, that I had thy head!
he has found the meaning: But I will gloze with him.
How courtesy would seem to cover sin, When what is done is like an hypocrite, The which is good in nothing but in sight!
He hath found the meaning, for which we mean To have his head.
Doth your highness call?
Thaliard, You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes Her private actions to your secrecy; And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
My lord, 'Tis done.
Enough.
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
Thaliard, adieu!
Till Pericles be dead, My heart can lend no succor to my head.
Let none disturb us.
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
And keep your mind, till you return to us, Peaceful and comfortable!
Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
An angry brow, dread lord.
How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence They have their nourishment?
Thou know'st I have power To take thy life from thee.
Rise, prithee, rise.
To bear with patience Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus, That minister'st a potion unto me That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch, Where as thou know'st, against the face of death, I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
Alas, sir!
Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
I do not doubt thy faith; But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth, From whence we had our being and our birth.
So, this is Tyre, and this the court.
Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous.
How!
the king gone!
If further yet you will be satisfied, Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves, He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
What from Antioch?
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
I'll do my best, sir.
O, 'tis too true.
But see what heaven can do!
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
O, let those cities that of plenty's cup And her prosperities so largely taste, With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
Where's the lord governor?
Here.
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste, For comfort is too far for us to expect.
We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore, A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
I thought as much.
I go, my lord.
Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist; If wars, we are unable to resist.
The gods of Greece protect you!
And we'll pray for you.
The which when any shall not gratify, Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought, Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves, The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
Till when, the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,  Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile, Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.
Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
What, ho, Pilch!
Ha, come and bring away the nets!
What, Patch breech, I say!
What say you, master?
Look how thou stirrest now!
come away, or I'll fetch thee with a wanion.
Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now.
Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled?
A pretty moral.
But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in the belfry.
Why, man?
Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
Simonides!
We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey.
Honest!
good fellow, what's that?
If it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody look after it.
May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way!
No, friend, cannot you beg?
Here's them in our country Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working.
Canst thou catch any fishes, then?
I never practised it.
Die quoth a?
Now gods forbid!
I have a gown here; come, put it on; keep thee warm.
Now, afore me, a handsome fellow!
I thank you, sir.
Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.
I did but crave.
But crave!
Then I'll turn craver too, and so I shall 'scape whipping.
Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?
How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!
Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?
Not well.
The good King Simonides, do you call him.
He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government.
How far is his court distant from this shore?
Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish to make one there.
Help, master, help!
An armour, friends!
I pray you, let me see it.
Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses, Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself; And though it was mine own, part of my heritage, Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
What mean you, sir?
Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!
Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters: there are certain condolements, certain vails.
I hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from whence you had it.
Believe 't, I will.
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
They are, my liege; And stay your coming to present themselves.
It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express My commendations great, whose merit's less.
Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
He loves you well that holds his life of you.
Who is the second that presents himself?
And what's the third?
What is the fourth?
A burning torch that's turned upside down; The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.  '
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will, Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
He well may be a stranger, for he comes To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
And on set purpose let his armour rust Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan The outward habit by the inward man.
But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw Into the gallery.
Knights, To say you're welcome were superfluous.
To place upon the volume of your deeds, As in a title page, your worth in arms, Were more than you expect, or more than's fit, Since every worth in show commends itself.
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast: You are princes and my guests.
'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.
We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
Sir, yonder is your place.
Some other is more fit.
You are right courteous knights.
Sit, sir, sit.
By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts, These cates resist me, she but thought upon.
By Juno, that is queen of marriage, All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
Wishing him my meat.
To me he seems like diamond to glass.
What, are you merry, knights?
Who can be other in this royal presence?
We thank your grace.
What is it To me, my father?
How!
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him, Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.
I thank him.
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
And further he desires to know of you, Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles, A gentleman of Tyre, Who only by misfortune of the seas Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune, And will awake him from his melancholy.
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles, And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
Even in your armours, as you are address'd, Will very well become a soldier's dance.
So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
In those that practise them they are, my lord.
O, that's as much as you would be denied Of your fair courtesy.
Unclasp, unclasp: Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.
But you the best.
I am at your grace's pleasure.
'Twas very strange.
'Tis very true.
See, not a man in private conference Or council has respect with him but he.
It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
And cursed be he that will not second it.
Follow me, then.
Lord Helicane, a word.
With me?
and welcome: happy day, my lords.
Know that our griefs are risen to the top, And now at length they overflow their banks.
Your griefs!
for what?
wrong not your prince you love.
Live, noble Helicane!
Good morrow to the good Simonides.
Knights, from my daughter this I let you know, That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake A married life.
May we not get access to her, my lord?
'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery; This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd And on her virgin honour will not break it.
Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
All fortune to the good Simonides!
To you as much, sir!
It is your grace's pleasure to commend; Not my desert.
Sir, you are music's master.
The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
Let me ask you one thing: What do you think of my daughter, sir?
A most virtuous princess.
And she is fair too, is she not?
As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.
I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.
What's here?
A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art A villain.
Traitor, thou liest.
Traitor!
Ay, traitor.
Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
My actions are as noble as my thoughts, That never relish'd of a base descent.
No?
Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
Then, as you are as virtuous as fair, Resolve your angry father, if my tongue Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe To any syllable that made love to you.
Why, sir, say if you had, Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
I am glad on't with all my heart.
I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
Will you, not having my consent, Bestow your love and your affections Upon a stranger?
Yes, if you love me, sir.
Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.
What, are you both agreed?
Yes, if it please your majesty.
It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed; And then with what haste you can get you to bed.
Now sleep y slaked hath the rout; No din but snores the house about, Made louder by the o'er fed breast Of this most pompous marriage feast.
The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches fore the mouse's hole; And crickets sing at the oven's mouth, E'er the blither for their drouth.
Now, Lychorida!
How, how, Lychorida!
Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
O you gods!
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts, And snatch them straight away?
We here below Recall not what we give, and therein may Use honour with you.
Patience, good sir, Even for this charge.
Now, mild may be thy life!
For a more blustrous birth had never babe: Quiet and gentle thy conditions!
for Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world That ever was prince's child.
Happy what follows!
What courage, sir?
God save you!
Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw; It hath done to me the worst.
Yet, for the love Of this poor infant, this fresh new sea farer, I would it would be quiet.
Slack the bolins there!
Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
Blow, and split thyself.
That's your superstition.
Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still observed: and we are strong in custom.
Therefore briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.
As you think meet.
Most wretched queen!
Here she lies, sir.
Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked and bitumed ready.
I thank thee.
Mariner, say what coast is this?
We are near Tarsus.
Thither, gentle mariner.
Alter thy course for Tyre.
By break of day, if the wind cease.
O, make for Tarsus!
Philemon, ho!
Doth my lord call?
Get fire and meat for these poor men: 'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
I have been in many; but such a night as this, Till now, I ne'er endured.
Your master will be dead ere you return; There's nothing can be minister'd to nature That can recover him.
Give this to the 'pothecary, And tell me how it works.
Good morrow.
Good morrow to your lordship.
Gentlemen, Why do you stir so early?
That is the cause we trouble you so early; 'Tis not our husbandry.
O, you say well.
So; lift there.
What is that?
Sir, even now Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest: 'Tis of some wreck.
Set 't down, let's look upon't.
'Tis like a coffin, sir.
Whate'er it be, 'Tis wondrous heavy.
'Tis so, my lord.
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
Did the sea cast it up?
I never saw so huge a billow, sir, As toss'd it upon shore.
Wrench it open; Soft!
it smells most sweetly in my sense.
A delicate odour.
As ever hit my nostril.
So, up with it.
O you most potent gods!
what's here?
a corse!
Most strange!
Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured With full bags of spices!
A passport too!
Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
'Here I give to understand, If e'er this coffin drive a land, I, King Pericles, have lost This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
Most likely, sir.
Nay, certainly to night; For look how fresh she looks!
They were too rough That threw her in the sea.
Make a fire within: Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
Death may usurp on nature many hours, And yet the fire of life kindle again The o'erpress'd spirits.
I heard of an Egyptian That had nine hours lien dead, Who was by good appliance recovered.
Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
O dear Diana, Where am I?
Where's my lord?
What world is this?
Is not this strange?
Most rare.
Hush, my gentle neighbours!
Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to, For her relapse is mortal.
Come, come; And AEsculapius guide us!
Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally, Yet glance full wanderingly on us.
O your sweet queen!
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither, To have bless'd mine eyes with her!
We cannot but obey The powers above us.
Could I rage and roar As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end Must be as 'tis.
Madam, my thanks and prayers.
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore, Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and The gentlest winds of heaven.
I will embrace Your offer.
Come, dearest madam.
It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember, Even on my eaning time; but whether there Deliver'd, by the holy gods, I cannot rightly say.
But since King Pericles, My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again, A vestal livery will I take me to, And never more have joy.
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre, Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus, Unto Diana there a votaress.
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
The fitter, then, the gods should have her.
Here she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
Thou art resolved?
I am resolved.
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed, To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues, The purple violets, and marigolds, Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave, While summer days do last.
Ay me!
poor maid, Born in a tempest, when my mother died, This world to me is like a lasting storm, Whirring me from my friends.
How now, Marina!
why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you?
Do not Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have A nurse of me.
Lord, how your favour's changed With this unprofitable woe!
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
Well, I will go; But yet I have no desire to it.
Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
I warrant you, madam.
My thanks, sweet madam.
Is this wind westerly that blows?
South west.
When I was born, the wind was north.
Was't so?
My father, as nurse said, did never fear, But cried 'Good seaman!  '
When was this?
Come, say your prayers.
What mean you?
Why will you kill me?
To satisfy my lady.
Why would she have me kill'd?
My commission Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow You have a gentle heart.
I am sworn, And will dispatch.
Hold, villain!
A prize!
a prize!
Half part, mates, half part.
Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes; And they have seized Marina.
Let her go: There's no hope she will return.
I'll swear she's dead, And thrown into the sea.
But I'll see further: Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, Not carry her aboard.
If she remain, Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
Boult!
Sir?
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants.
We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.
We were never so much out of creatures.
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for them.
If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again.
But shall I search the market?
What else, man?
The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience.
The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast meat for worms.
But I'll go search the market.
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
Why to give over, I pray you?
is it a shame to get when we are old?
Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
As well as we!
ay, and better too; we offend worse.
Neither is our profession any trade; it's no calling.
But here comes Boult.
Come your ways.
My masters, you say she's a virgin?
O, sir, we doubt it not.
Boult, has she any qualities?
What's her price, Boult?
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall have her first.  '
Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been.
Get this done as I command you.
Performance shall follow.
Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
Why lament you, pretty one?
That I am pretty.
Come, the gods have done their part in you.
I accuse them not.
You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
The more my fault To scape his hands where I was like to die.
Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
No.
Are you a woman?
What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
An honest woman, or not a woman.
The gods defend me!
If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir you up.
Boult's returned.
Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
'Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father's testament.
There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description.
We shall have him here to morrow with his best ruff on.
To night, to night.
But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i' the hams?
Who, Monsieur Veroles?
Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but repair it.
I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.
Pray you, come hither awhile.
You have fortunes coming upon you.
I understand you not.
'Faith, some do, and some do not.
But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint,
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
I may so.
Who should deny it?
Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
Come your ways; follow me.
If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
What have we to do with Diana?
Pray you, will you go with us?
O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
I think You'll turn a child again.
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world, I'ld give it to undo the deed.
That she is dead.
Nurses are not the fates, To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
She died at night; I'll say so.
Who can cross it?
Unless you play the pious innocent, And for an honest attribute cry out 'She died by foul play.  '
O, go to.
Well, well, Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods Do like this worst.
Be one of those that think The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence, And open this to Pericles.
I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are, And of how coward a spirit.
To such proceeding Who ever but his approbation added, Though not his prime consent, he did not flow From honourable sources.
Heavens forgive it!
And as for Pericles, What should he say?
Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short; Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't; Making, to take your imagination, From bourn to bourn, region to region.
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime To use one language in each several clime Where our scenes seem to live.
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
Did you ever hear the like?
But to have divinity preached there!
did you ever dream of such a thing?
No, no.
Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come here.
Fie, fie upon her!
she's able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation.
We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
Now, the pox upon her green sickness for me!
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the way to the pox.
Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.
How now!
How a dozen of virginities?
Now, the gods to bless your honour!
I am glad to see your honour in good health.
You may so; 'tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs.
If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
Well, call forth, call forth.
What, prithee?
O, sir, I can be modest.
Is she not a fair creature?
'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
Well, there's for you: leave us.
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and I'll have done presently.
I beseech you, do.
First, I would have you note, this is an honourable man.
I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to.
What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
Ha' you done?
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some pains to work her to your manage.
Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
What trade, sir?
Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
I cannot be offended with my trade.
Please you to name it.
How long have you been of this profession?
E'er since I can remember.
Did you go to 't so young?
Were you a gamester at five or at seven?
Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale.
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come into 't?
I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?
Who is my principal?
Why, your herb woman; she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity.
O, you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing.
But I protest to thee, pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee.
Come, bring me to some private place: come, come.
How's this?
how's this?
Some more; be sage.
I did not think Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind, Thy speech had alter'd it.
The good gods preserve you!
I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
Avaunt, thou damned door keeper!
Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it, Would sink and overwhelm you.
Away!
How's this?
We must take another course with you.
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel.
Come your ways.
Whither would you have me?
I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it.
Come your ways.
We'll have no more gentlemen driven away.
Come your ways, I say.
How now!
O abominable!
Marry, hang her up for ever!
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too.
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall be ploughed.
Hark, hark, you gods!
She conjures: away with her!
Would she had never come within my doors!
Marry, hang you!
She's born to undo us.
Will you not go the way of women kind?
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
Whither wilt thou have me?
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
Prithee, tell me one thing first.
Come now, your one thing.
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
Neither of these are so bad as thou art, Since they do better thee in their command.
What would you have me do?
go to the wars, would you?
where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one?
Do any thing but this thou doest.
But can you teach all this you speak of?
Prove that I cannot, take me home again, And prostitute me to the basest groom That doth frequent your house.
But amongst honest women.
'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances Into an honest house, our story says.
Where is lord Helicanus?
he can resolve you.
O, here he is.
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene, And in it is Lysimachus the governor, Who craves to come aboard.
What is your will?
That he have his.
Call up some gentlemen.
Ho, gentlemen!
my lord calls.
Doth your lordship call?
Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard; I pray ye, greet them fairly.
Sir, This is the man that can, in aught you would, Resolve you.
Hail, reverend sir!
the gods preserve you!
You wish me well.
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs, Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us, I made to it, to know of whence you are.
First, what is your place?
I am the governor of this place you lie before.
Upon what ground is his distemperature?
'Twould be too tedious to repeat; But the main grief springs from the loss Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
May we not see him?
Yet let me obtain my wish.
Behold him.
This was a goodly person, Till the disaster that, one mortal night, Drove him to this.
Sir king, all hail!
the gods preserve you!
Hail, royal sir!
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
Sir, We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager, Would win some words of him.
'Tis well bethought.
Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit That bears recovery's name.
O, sir, a courtesy Which if we should deny, the most just gods For every graff would send a caterpillar, And so afflict our province.
Yet once more Let me entreat to know at large the cause Of your king's sorrow.
O, here is The lady that I sent for.
Welcome, fair one!
Is't not a goodly presence?
She's a gallant lady.
Sir, I will use My utmost skill in his recovery, provided That none but I and my companion maid Be suffer'd to come near him.
Mark'd he your music?
No, nor look'd on us.
See, she will speak to him.
Hail, sir!
my lord, lend ear.
Hum, ha!
My fortunes parentage  good parentage  To equal mine!
was it not thus?
what say you?
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage, You would not do me violence.
I do think so.
Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
You are like something that What country woman?
Here of these shores?
I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows; Her stature to an inch; as wand like straight; As silver voiced; her eyes as jewel like And cased as richly; in pace another Juno; Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry, The more she gives them speech.
Where do you live?
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck You may discern the place.
Where were you bred?
And how achieved you these endowments, which You make more rich to owe?
If I should tell my history, it would seem Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
So indeed I did.
Report thy parentage.
I think thou said'st Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury, And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine, If both were open'd.
Some such thing I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
My name is Marina.
Patience, good sir, Or here I'll cease.
Nay, I'll be patient.
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me, To call thyself Marina.
The name Was given me by one that had some power, My father, and a king.
How!
a king's daughter?
But are you flesh and blood?
Have you a working pulse?
and are no fairy?
Motion!
Well; speak on.
Where were you born?
And wherefore call'd Marina?
Call'd Marina For I was born at sea.
At sea!
what mother?
O, stop there a little!
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
I will believe you by the syllable Of what you shall deliver.
Yet, give me leave: How came you in these parts?
where were you bred?
Ho, Helicanus!
Calls my lord?
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor, Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst, What this maid is, or what is like to be, That thus hath made me weep?
I know not; but Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene Speaks nobly of her.
She would never tell Her parentage; being demanded that, She would sit still and weep.
First, sir, I pray, What is your title?
Is it no more to be your daughter than To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
Thaisa was my mother, who did end The minute I began.
Now, blessing on thee!
rise; thou art my child.
Give me fresh garments.
I embrace you.
Give me my robes.
I am wild in my beholding.
O heavens bless my girl!
But, hark, what music?
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt, How sure you are my daughter.
But, what music?
My lord, I hear none.
None!
The music of the spheres!
List, my Marina.
It is not good to cross him; give him way.
Rarest sounds!
Do ye not hear?
My lord, I hear.
Most heavenly music!
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.
A pillow for his head: So, leave him all.
Celestial Dian, goddess argentine, I will obey thee.
Helicanus!
Sir?
Sir, lend me your arm.
Come, my Marina.
Now our sands are almost run; More a little, and then dumb.
Hail, Dian!
Voice and favour!
You are, you are O royal Pericles!
What means the nun?
she dies!
help, gentlemen!
Noble sir, If you have told Diana's altar true, This is your wife.
Upon this coast, I warrant you.
'Tis most certain.
Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
Early in blustering morn this lady was Thrown upon this shore.
I oped the coffin, Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her Here in Diana's temple.
May we see them?
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house, Whither I invite you.
Look, Thaisa is recovered.
O, let me look!
If he be none of mine, my sanctity Will to my sense bend no licentious ear, But curb it, spite of seeing.
O, my lord, Are you not Pericles?
Like him you spake, Like him you are: did you not name a tempest, A birth, and death?
The voice of dead Thaisa!
That Thaisa am I, supposed dead And drown'd.
Immortal Dian!
Now I know you better.
When we with tears parted Pentapolis, The king my father gave you such a ring.
This, this: no more, you gods!
My heart Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
Look, who kneels here!
Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa; Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina For she was yielded there.
Blest, and mine own!
Hail, madam, and my queen!
I know you not.
'Twas Helicanus then.
Reverend sir, The gods can have no mortal officer More like a god than you.
Will you deliver How this dead queen re lives?
I will, my lord.
Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision!
I Will offer night oblations to thee.
Thaisa, This prince, the fair betrothed of your daughter, Shall marry her at Pentapolis.
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir, My father's dead.
Heavens make a star of him!
Yet there, my queen, We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves Will in that kingdom spend our following days: Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
Old John of Gaunt, time honour'd Lancaster, Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, Which then our leisure would not let us hear, Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
I have, my liege.
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; Or worthily, as a good subject should, On some known ground of treachery in him?
As near as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
Many years of happy days befal My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us, As well appeareth by the cause you come; Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love, Tendering the precious safety of my prince, And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage, Disclaiming here the kindred of the king, And lay aside my high blood's royalty, Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him.
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
O, let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf, Till I have told this slander of his blood, How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers; The other part reserved I by consent, For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account, Since last I went to France to fetch his queen: Now swallow down that lie.
For Gloucester's death, I slew him not; but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
To be a make peace shall become my age: Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
And, Norfolk, throw down his.
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame: The one my duty owes; but my fair name, Despite of death that lives upon my grave, To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here, Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, The which no balm can cure but his heart blood Which breathed this poison.
Rage must be withstood: Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar fear impeach my height Before this out dared dastard?
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims, To stir against the butchers of his life!
But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct, Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
To God, the widow's champion and defence.
Why, then, I will.
Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight: O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear, That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career, Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom, They may break his foaming courser's back, And throw the rider headlong in the lists, A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry: As much good stay with thee as go with me!
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold, Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay For nothing but his majesty's approach.
What is thy name?
and wherefore comest thou hither, Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou?
and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
On pain of death, no person be so bold Or daring hardy as to touch the lists, Except the marshal and such officers Appointed to direct these fair designs.
The appellant in all duty greets your highness, And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right, So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to day thou shed, Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself, On pain to be found false and recreant, To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, A traitor to his God, his king and him; And dares him to set forward to the fight.
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, On pain to be found false and recreant, Both to defend himself and to approve Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal; Courageously and with a free desire Attending but the signal to begin.
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
Draw near, And list what with our council we have done.
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom, Which I with some unwillingness pronounce: The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile; The hopeless word of 'never to return' Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
It boots thee not to be compassionate: After our sentence plaining comes too late.
Then thus I turn me from my country's light, To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
Return again, and take an oath with thee.
I swear.
And I, to keep all this.
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor, My name be blotted from the book of life, And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know; And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Farewell, my liege.
Now no way can I stray; Save back to England, all the world's my way.
Six frozen winter spent, Return with welcome home from banishment.
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give: Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow; Thou canst help time to furrow me with age, But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; Thy word is current with him for my death, But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child, To smooth his fault I should have been more mild: A partial slander sought I to avoid, And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so: Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know, From where you do remain let paper show.
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride, As far as land will let me, by your side.
I have too few to take my leave of you, When the tongue's office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
What is six winters?
they are quickly gone.
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return.
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages, and in the end, Having my freedom, boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief?
All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus; There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee, But thou the king.
Woe doth the heavier sit, Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
O, who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no!
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way: Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu; My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
We did observe.
Cousin Aumerle, How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so, But to the next highway, and there I left him.
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
What said our cousin when you parted with him?
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Bushy, what news?
Where lies he?
At Ely House.
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him: Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
Amen.
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
O, but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony: Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth; For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
What comfort, man?
how is't with aged Gaunt?
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old: Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast; And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
No, misery makes sport to mock itself: Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me, I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
Should dying men flatter with those that live?
No, no, men living flatter those that die.
Thou, now a dying, say'st thou flatterest me.
O, no!
thou diest, though I the sicker be.
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
A lunatic lean witted fool, Presuming on an ague's privilege, Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence.
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son, For that I was his father Edward's son; That blood already, like the pelican, Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused: My brother Gloucester, plain well meaning soul, Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
What says he?
Nay, nothing; all is said.
His tongue is now a stringless instrument; Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that.
How long shall I be patient?
ah, how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs, Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage, nor my own disgrace, Have ever made me sour my patient cheek, Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
Why, uncle, what's the matter?
O my liege, Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time His charters and his customary rights; Let not to morrow then ensue to day; Be not thyself; for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God  God forbid I say true!
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights, Call in the letters patent that he hath By his attorneys general to sue His livery, and deny his offer'd homage, You pluck a thousand dangers on your head, You lose a thousand well disposed hearts And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight: Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business.
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
And living too; for now his son is duke.
Barely in title, not in revenue.
Richly in both, if justice had her right.
My heart is great; but it must break with silence, Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man; Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
No good at all that I can do for him; Unless you call it good to pity him, Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne In him, a royal prince, and many more Of noble blood in this declining land.
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes, And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
And daily new exactions are devised, As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what: But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not, But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows: More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
He hath not money for these Irish wars, His burthenous taxations notwithstanding, But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
We see the very wreck that we must suffer; And unavoided is the danger now, For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering; but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is.
Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
To horse, to horse!
urge doubts to them that fear.
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
Madam, your majesty is too much sad: You promised, when you parted with the king, To lay aside life harming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition.
To please the king I did; to please myself I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
God save your majesty!
and well met, gentlemen: I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
Why hopest thou so?
'tis better hope he is; For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope: Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
That he, our hope, might have retired his power, And driven into despair an enemy's hope, Who strongly hath set footing in this land: The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, And with uplifted arms is safe arrived At Ravenspurgh.
Now God in heaven forbid!
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship, And all the household servants fled with him To Bolingbroke.
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir: Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy, And I, a gasping new deliver'd mother, Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
Despair not, madam.
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair, and be at enmity With cozening hope: he is a flatterer, A parasite, a keeper back of death, Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, Which false hope lingers in extremity.
Here comes the Duke of York.
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts: Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
My lord, your son was gone before I came.
He was?
Why, so!
go all which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold, And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; Bid her send me presently a thousand pound: Hold, take my ring.
What is't, knave?
An hour before I came, the duchess died.
God for his mercy!
what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God, So my untruth had not provoked him to it, The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,  cousin, I would say  pray, pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I know how or which way to order these affairs Thus thrust disorderly into my hands, Never believe me.
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland, But none returns .
For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible.
And that's the wavering commons: for their love Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
If judgement lie in them, then so do we, Because we ever have been near the king.
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle: The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
Thither will I with you; for little office The hateful commons will perform for us, Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go along with us?
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain, We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
Alas, poor duke!
the task he undertakes Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry: Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
Well, we may meet again.
I fear me, never.
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
Of much less value is my company Than your good words.
But who comes here?
It is my son, young Harry Percy, Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how fares your uncle?
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
Why, is he not with the queen?
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court, Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the king.
What was his reason?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge, I never in my life did look on him.
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
My gracious lord, I tender you my service, Such as it is, being tender, raw and young: Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert.
How far is it to Berkeley?
and what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard; And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour; None else of name and noble estimate.
Welcome, my lords.
I wot your love pursues A banish'd traitor: all my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; Which, till my infant fortune comes to years, Stands for my bounty.
But who comes here?
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
My lord, my answer is  to Lancaster; And I am come to seek that name in England; And I must find that title in your tongue, Before I make reply to aught you say.
I shall not need transport my words by you; Here comes his grace in person.
My noble uncle!
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
My gracious uncle
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle: I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace' In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But then more 'why?'
why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom, Frighting her pale faced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault: On what condition stands it and wherein?
Even in condition of the worst degree, In gross rebellion and detested treason: Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come Before the expiration of thy time, In braving arms against thy sovereign.
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford; But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
The noble duke hath been too much abused.
It stands your grace upon to do him right.
Base men by his endowments are made great.
An offer, uncle, that we will accept: But we must win your grace to go with us To Bristol castle, which they say is held By Bushy, Bagot and their complices, The caterpillars of the commonwealth, Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman: The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Bring forth these men.
More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England.
Lords, farewell.
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd With letters of your love to her at large.
Thanks, gentle uncle.
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
Yea, my lord.
How brooks your grace the air, After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand, Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs: As a long parted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth, And do thee favours with my royal hands.
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss; Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security, Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
Discomfortable cousin!
Welcome, my lord!
how far off lies your power?
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord, Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth: O, call back yesterday, bid time return, And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face, and they are fled; And, till so much blood thither come again, Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty!
thou sleepest.
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name!
a puny subject strikes At thy great glory.
More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my care tuned tongue deliver him!
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared; The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost?
why, 'twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd To bear the tidings of calamity.
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace?
terrible hell make war Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
Where is the duke my father with his power?
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes, But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe, And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight: And fight and die is death destroying death; Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
My father hath a power; inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb.
Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state and inclination of the day: So may you by my dull and heavy eye, My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
What say you now?
what comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away; A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
My liege, one word.
He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers: let them hence away, From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast.
The news is very fair and good, my lord: Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say 'King Richard': alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head.
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief Left I his title out.
The time hath been, Would you have been so brief with him, he would Have been so brief with you, to shorten you, For taking so the head, your whole head's length .
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself Against their will.
But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord, Against thy entrance.
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?
Yes, my good lord, It doth contain a king; King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone: And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rush'd upon!
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
What must the king do now?
must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
My lord, in the base court he doth attend To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon, Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court?
Base court, where kings grow base, To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court?
Come down?
Down, court!
down, king!
For night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.
What says his majesty?
Sorrow and grief of heart Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man Yet he is come.
Stand all apart, And show fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord, As my true service shall deserve your love.
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have, That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes; Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young to be your father, Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too; For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
Yea, my good lord.
Then I must not say no.
What sport shall we devise here in this garden, To drive away the heavy thought of care?
Madam, we'll play at bowls.
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs, And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
Madam, we'll dance.
Madam, we'll tell tales.
Of sorrow or of joy?
Of either, madam.
Madam, I'll sing.
'Tis well that thou hast cause But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
And I could sing, would weeping do me good, And never borrow any tear of thee.
But stay, here come the gardeners: Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins, They'll talk of state; for every one doth so Against a change ; woe is forerun with woe.
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, Which, like unruly children, make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight: Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
What, are they dead?
They are; and Bolingbroke Hath seized the wasteful king.
O, what pity is it That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land As we this garden!
What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
Depress'd he is already, and deposed 'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's, That tell black tidings.
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden, How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth, Divine his downfall?
Say, where, when, and how, Camest thou by this ill tidings?
speak, thou wretch.
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
Poor queen!
so that thy state might be no worse, I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
Call forth Bagot.
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
Princes and noble lords, What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars, On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death, That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest, And will maintain what thou hast said is false In thy heart blood, though being all too base To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
Excepting one, I would he were the best In all this presence that hath moved me so.
If that thy valour stand on sympathy, There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine: By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st, I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest; And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart, Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
Who sets me else?
by heaven, I'll throw at all: I have a thousand spirits in one breast, To answer twenty thousand such as you.
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
'Tis very true: you were in presence then; And you can witness with me this is true.
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
Surrey, thou liest.
Dishonourable boy!
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
As surely as I live, my lord.
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom Of good old Abraham!
Lords appellants, Your differences shall all rest under gage Till we assign you to your days of trial.
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
Marry.
God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak, Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains, Of capital treason we arrest you here.
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
I will be his conduct.
Lords, you that here are under our arrest, Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your love, And little look'd for at your helping hands.
Alack, why am I sent for to a king, Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd?
I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs: Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission.
Yet I well remember The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!  '
Give me the crown.
I thought you had been willing to resign.
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine: You may my glories and my state depose, But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
Are you contented to resign the crown?
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be; Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Must I do so?
and must I ravel out My weaved up folly?
Gentle Northumberland, If thy offences were upon record, Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop To read a lecture of them?
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
My lord,
Go some of you and fetch a looking glass.
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
The commons will not then be satisfied.
Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet?
hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine, And made no deeper wounds?
O flattering glass, Like to my followers in prosperity, Thou dost beguile me!
Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men?
was this the face That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
Was this the face that faced so many follies, And was at last out faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in this face: As brittle as the glory is the face;
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport, How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd The shadow of your face.
Say that again.
Name it, fair cousin.
Yet ask.
And shall I have?
You shall.
Then give me leave to go.
Whither?
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
O, good!
convey?
conveyers are you all, That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
You holy clergymen, is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind Transform'd and weaken'd?
hath Bolingbroke deposed Thine intellect?
hath he been in thy heart?
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts, I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France: Think I am dead and that even here thou takest, As from my death bed, thy last living leave.
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed: You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
Doubly divorced!
Bad men, you violate A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me, And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
And must we be divided?
must we part?
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
Banish us both and send the king with me.
That were some love but little policy.
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here; Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
So longest way shall have the longest moans.
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
So, now I have mine own again, be gone, That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
We make woe wanton with this fond delay: Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest, When weeping made you break the story off, of our two cousins coming into London.
Where did I leave?
At that sad stop, my lord, Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
Alack, poor Richard!
where rode he the whilst?
Here comes my son Aumerle.
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not: God knows I had as lief be none as one.
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time, Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford?
hold those justs and triumphs?
For aught I know, my lord, they do.
You will be there, I know.
If God prevent not, I purpose so.
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale?
let me see the writing.
My lord, 'tis nothing.
No matter, then, who see it; I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
I do beseech your grace to pardon me: It is a matter of small consequence, Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
Bound to himself!
what doth he with a bond That he is bound to?
Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see the writing.
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason!
foul treason!
Villain!
traitor!
slave!
What is the matter, my lord?
Ho!
who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
Why, what is it, my lord?
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth, I will appeach the villain.
What is the matter?
Peace, foolish woman.
I will not peace.
What is the matter, Aumerle.
Good mother, be content; it is no more Than my poor life must answer.
Thy life answer!
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
Strike him, Aumerle.
Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain!
never more come in my sight.
Give me my boots, I say.
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons?
or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age, And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee?
is he not thine own?
Thou fond mad woman, Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
He shall be none; We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
Away, fond woman!
were he twenty times my son, I would appeach him.
Hadst thou groan'd for him As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
Make way, unruly woman!
After, Aumerle!
mount thee upon his horse; Spur post, and get before him to the king, And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last; If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince, And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
And what said the gallant?
His answer was, he would unto the stews, And from the common'st creature pluck a glove, And wear it as a favour; and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years May happily bring forth.
But who comes here?
Where is the king?
What means our cousin, that he stares and looks So wildly?
God save your grace!
I do beseech your majesty, To have some conference with your grace alone.
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousin now?
For ever may my knees grow to the earth, My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
Then give me leave that I may turn the key, That no man enter till my tale be done.
Have thy desire.
My liege, beware; look to thyself; Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.
Villain, I'll make thee safe.
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
What is the matter, uncle?
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show.
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy !
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; And he shall spend mine honour with his shame, As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
What ho, my liege!
for God's sake, let me in.
What shrill voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing, And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.  '
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in: I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray, More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound; This let alone will all the rest confound.
O king, believe not this hard hearted man!
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
Sweet York, be patient.
Hear me, gentle liege.
Rise up, good aunt.
Not yet, I thee beseech: For ever will I walk upon my knees, And never see day that the happy sees, Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy, By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
Pleads he in earnest?
Good aunt, stand up.
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;' Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.  '
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now; Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: The word is short, but not so short as sweet; No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.  '
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard hearted lord, That set'st the word itself against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land; The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear; That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
Good aunt, stand up.
I do not sue to stand; Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
With all my heart I pardon him.
A god on earth thou art.
But for our trusty brother in law and the abbot, With all the rest of that consorted crew, Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order several powers To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are: They shall not live within this world, I swear, But I will have them, if I once know where.
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu: Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake, 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
Was it not so?
These were his very words.
'Have I no friend?'
quoth he: he spake it twice, And urged it twice together, did he not?
He did.
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man' That would divorce this terror from my heart;' Meaning the king at Pomfret.
Come, let's go: I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
Ha, ha!
keep time: how sour sweet music is, When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men's lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string; But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
Hail, royal prince!
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king, When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York, With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld In London streets, that coronation day, When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary, That horse that thou so often hast bestrid, That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
Rode he on Barbary?
Tell me, gentle friend, How went he under him?
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
My lord, will't please you to fall to?
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
Help, help, help!
How now!
what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
That hand shall burn in never quenching fire That staggers thus my person.
Exton, thy fierce hand Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul!
thy seat is up on high; Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
As full of valour as of royal blood: Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consumed with fire Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire; But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to London sent The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent: The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursed in this paper here.
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains; And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely, Two of the dangerous consorted traitors That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot; Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land.
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York, And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
His majesty, Tend'ring my person’s safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
Upon what cause?
Because my name is George.
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest As yet I do not.
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity.
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure But the queen’s kindred and night walking heralds That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
I’ll tell you what: I think it is our way, If we will keep in favor with the king, To be her men and wear her livery.
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself, Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen, Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.
His majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference, Of what degree soever, with his brother.
Even so.
An please your Worship, Brakenbury, You may partake of anything we say.
We speak no treason, man.
We say the king Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
Naught to do with Mistress Shore?
I tell thee, fellow, He that doth naught with her, excepting one, Were best he do it secretly, alone.
What one, my lord?
Her husband, knave.
Wouldst thou betray me?
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
We are the queen’s abjects and must obey.
Brother, farewell.
I will unto the king, And whatsoe'er you will employ me in, Were it to call King Edward’s widow “sister,” I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.
I will deliver you or else lie for you.
Meantime, have patience.
I must perforce.
Farewell.
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here?
The new delivered Hastings?
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment.
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
What news abroad?
No news so bad abroad as this at home: The king is sickly, weak and melancholy, And his physicians fear him mightily.
Now, by Saint Paul, that news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long, And overmuch consumed his royal person.
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Where is he, in his bed?
He is.
Go you before, and I will follow you.
Set down, set down your honorable load, If honor may be shrouded in a hearse, Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds?
Villains, set down the corse or, by Saint Paul, I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.
My lord, stand back and let the coffin pass.
Unmannered dog, stand thou when I command!
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast, Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
What, do you tremble?
Are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal, And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell.
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body; His soul thou canst not have.
Therefore begone.
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
Lady, you know no rules of charity, Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
Villain, thou know’st not law of God nor man.
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
O, wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself.
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self.
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself.
By such despair I should accuse myself.
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
Say that I slew them not.
Then say they were not slain.
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
I did not kill your husband.
Why then, he is alive.
Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.
In thy foul throat thou liest.
Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood,
I was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue, That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind, That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
Didst thou not kill this king?
I grant you.
Dost grant me, hedgehog?
Then, God grant me too Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed.
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
The better for the King of heaven that hath him.
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
Some dungeon.
Your bedchamber.
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
So will it, madam till I lie with you.
I hope so.
I know so.
Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.
Your beauty was the cause of that effect  Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world, So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide, These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
These eyes could never endure that beauty’s wrack.
You should not blemish it, if I stood by.
As all the world is cheerèd by the sun, So I by that.
It is my day, my life.
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life.
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
It is a quarrel most unnatural To be revenged on him that loveth thee.
It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be revenged on him that killed my husband.
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband.
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
Name him.
Plantagenet.
Why, that was he.
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
Where is he?
Here.
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight!
Thou dost infect mine eyes.
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead.
Arise, dissembler.
Though I wish thy death, I will not be the executioner.
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
I have already.
That was in thy rage.
Speak it again and, even with the word, This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love, Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.
I would I knew thy heart.
'Tis figured in my tongue.
I fear me both are false.
Then never man was man true.
Well, well, put up your sword.
Say then my peace is made.
That shall you know hereafter.
But shall I live in hope?
All men I hope live so.
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
To take is not to give.
What is it?
With all my heart, and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
Bid me farewell.
Sirs, take up the corse.
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
No, to Whitefriars.
There attend my coming.
Have patience, madam.
There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health.
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.
Therefore, for God’s sake, entertain good comfort And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.
If he were dead, what would betide on me?
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
The loss of such a lord includes all harms.
The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son To be your comforter when he is gone.
Ah, he is young, and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, A man that loves not me nor none of you.
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector?
Here comes the lord of Buckingham, and Derby.
Good time of day unto your royal Grace.
God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.
The countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby, To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
Saw you the king today, my lord of Derby?
But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty.
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
Madam, good hope.
His grace speaks cheerfully.
God grant him health.
Did you confer with him?
Ay, madam.
Would all were well but that will never be.
I fear our happiness is at the height.
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!
Who is it that complains unto the king That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
Because I cannot flatter and look fair, Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive and cog, Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken, sly, insinuating jacks?
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee?
When done thee wrong?
Or thee?
Or thee?
Or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all!
His royal grace, Whom God preserve better than you would wish, Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
I cannot tell.
The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
Since every jack became a gentleman, There’s many a gentle person made a jack.
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.
You envy my advancement, and my friends'.
God grant we never may have need of you.
Meantime God grants that we have need of you.
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed, I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence, but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him.
You may deny that you were not the mean Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
She may, my lord, for
She may, Lord Rivers.
Why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that.
She may help you to many fair preferments And then deny her aiding hand therein, And lay those honors on your high desert.
What may she not?
She may, ay, marry, may she
What, marry, may she?
What, marry, may she?
Marry with a king, A bachelor, a handsome stripling too.
I wis, your grandam had a worser match.
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured.
I had rather be a country servant maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.
And lessened be that small, God I beseech Him!
Thy honor, state, and seat is due to me.
What, threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not.
Out, devil!
I do remember them too well: Thou killed’st my husband Henry in the Tower, And Edward, my poor son, at Tewkesbury.
In all which time, you and your husband Grey Were factious for the house of Lancaster.
And, Rivers, so were you.
Was not your husband In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?
A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick, Ay, and forswore himself which Jesu pardon!
Which God revenge!
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world, Thou cacodemon!
There thy kingdom is.
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days Which here you urge to prove us enemies, We followed then our lord, our sovereign king.
So should we you, if you should be our king.
If I should be?
I had rather be a peddler.
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof.
Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?
But repetition of what thou hast marred.
That will I make before I let thee go.
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.
So just is God to right the innocent.
O, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
What, were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.
And leave out thee?
Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
Margaret.
Richard!
Ha?
I call thee not.
I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!
'Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.
”
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
False boding woman, end thy frantic curse, Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
To serve me well, you all should do me duty: Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
Peace, Master Marquess, you are malapert.
Your fire new stamp of honor is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge What ’twere to lose it and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them, And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
Good counsel, marry.
Learn it, learn it, marquess.
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
Ay, and much more; but I was born so high.
And turns the sun to shade.
Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity.
Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
Uncharitably with me have you dealt, And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.
Have done, have done.
O princely Buckingham, I’ll kiss thy hand In sign of league and amity with thee.
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
I will not think but they ascend the sky, And there awake God’s gentle sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, His venom tooth will rankle to the death.
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day, When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow, And say poor Margaret was a prophetess.
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
And so doth mine.
I muse why she’s at liberty.
I cannot blame her.
I never did her any, to my knowledge.
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid; He is franked up to fatting for his pains.
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.
A virtuous and a Christian like conclusion To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,  And for your Grace,  and yours, my gracious lords.
Catesby, I come.
Lords, will you go with me?
We wait upon your Grace.
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
Well thought upon.
I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.
Talkers are no good doers.
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears.
I like you lads.
About your business straight.
Go, go, dispatch.
We will, my noble lord.
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
What was your dream, my lord?
I pray you tell me.
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
Awaked you not in this sore agony?
No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.
O, then began the tempest to my soul.
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood, With that sour ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great father in law, renownèd Warwick, Who cried aloud, “What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?” And so he vanished.
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
Ah keeper, keeper, I have done those things, That now give evidence against my soul, For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me.
O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
I will, my lord.
God give your Grace good rest.
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.
Ho, who’s here?
What wouldst thou, fellow?
And how cam’st thou hither?
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
'Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.
Let him see our commission, and talk no more.
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands.
I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.
I’ll to the king and signify to him That thus I have resigned my charge to you.
You may, sir.
'Tis a point of wisdom.
Fare you well.
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
No.
He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.
Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.
The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
What, art thou afraid?
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
So I am to let him live.
I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
Nay, I prithee stay a little.
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
How dost thou feel thyself now?
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
Remember our reward when the deed’s done.
Zounds, he dies!
I had forgot the reward.
Where’s thy conscience now?
O, in the duke of Gloucester’s purse.
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
'Tis no matter.
Let it go.
There’s few or none will entertain it.
What if it come to thee again?
I’ll not meddle with it.
Zounds, ’tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke.
Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not.
He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
I am strong framed.
He cannot prevail with me.
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation.
Come, shall we fall to work?
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room.
O excellent device  and make a sop of him.
Soft, he wakes.
Strike!
No, we’ll reason with him.
Where art thou, keeper?
Give me a cup of wine.
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
In God’s name, what art thou?
A man, as you are.
But not, as I am, royal.
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me.
Why look you pale?
Who sent you hither?
Wherefore do you come?
To, to, to
To murder me?
Ay, ay.
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
Offended us you have not, but the king.
I shall be reconciled to him again.
Never, my lord.
Therefore prepare to die.
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent?
What is my offense?
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge?
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law?
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption, By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins, That you depart, and lay no hands on me.
The deed you undertake is damnable.
What we will do, we do upon command.
And he that hath commanded is our king.
Erroneous vassals, the great King of kings Hath in the tables of His law commanded That thou shalt do no murder.
Will thou then Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man’s?
Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand To hurl upon their heads that break His law.
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too.
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
And, like a traitor to the name of God, Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
Alas!
For whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
He sends you not to murder me for this, For in that sin he is as deep as I.
My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.
Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
If you do love my brother, hate not me.
I am his brother, and I love him well.
You are deceived.
Your brother Gloucester hates you.
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
Go you to him from me.
Ay, so we will.
Tell him, when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm, And charged us from his soul to love each other, He little thought of this divided friendship.
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
As snow in harvest.
Come, you deceive yourself.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you From this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven.
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
What shall we do?
Relent, and save your souls.
Which of you if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty, as I am now  If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would you not entreat for life?
Ay, you would beg, Were you in my distress.
Relent?
No.
'Tis cowardly and womanish.
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks.
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, Come thou on my side and entreat for me.
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Look behind you, my lord.
Take that, and that.
If all this will not do, I’ll drown you in the malmsey butt within.
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands Of this most grievous murder.
How now?
What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack you have been.
I would he knew that I had saved his brother.
So do not I.
Go, coward as thou art.
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial.
Why, so.
Now have I done a good day’s work.
So thrive I as I truly swear the like.
So prosper I as I swear perfect love.
And I as I love Hastings with my heart.
Dorset, embrace him.
Hastings, love Lord Marquess.
This interchange of love, I here protest, Upon my part shall be inviolable.
And so swear I.
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity.
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here To make the blessèd period of this peace.
And in good time, Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.
Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we have done deeds of charity, Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate, Between these swelling, wrong incensèd peers.
A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord.
Amongst this princely heap, if any here By false intelligence, or wrong surmise Hold me a foe, If I unwittingly, or in my rage, Have aught committed that is hardly borne By any in this presence, I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity; I hate it, and desire all good men’s love.
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
Why, madam, have I offered love for this, To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
Who knows not he is dead!
Who knows he is?
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
Is Clarence dead?
The order was reversed.
But he, poor man, by your first order died, And that a wingèd Mercury did bear.
I prithee, peace.
My soul is full of sorrow.
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
Then say at once what is it thou requests.
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life, Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk.
Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death, And shall the tongue give pardon to a slave?
This is the fruits of rashness.
Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king.
God will revenge it.
Come, lords, will you go To comfort Edward with our company?
We wait upon your Grace.
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
No, boy.
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast, And cry, “O Clarence, my unhappy son?”
Why do you look on us and shake your head, And call us orphans, wretches, castaways, If that our noble father were alive?
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
I do lament the sickness of the king, As loath to lose him, not your father’s death.
It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
The king mine uncle is to blame for it.
God will revenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
And so will I.
Peace, children, peace.
The king doth love you well.
Incapable and shallow innocents, You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.
Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape, And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice.
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
Ay, boy.
I cannot think it.
Hark, what noise is this?
Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, To chide my fortune and torment myself?
I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy.
What means this scene of rude impatience?
To make an act of tragic violence.
Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband.
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father’s death.
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned.
Your widow dolor likewise be unwept!
G ive me no help in lamentation.
I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
What stay had I but Edward?
And he’s gone.
What stay had we but Clarence?
And he’s gone.
What stays had I but they?
And they are gone.
Was never widow had so dear a loss.
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
Was never mother had so dear a loss.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
Comfort, dear mother.
God is much displeased That you take with unthankfulness, his doing.
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, Of the young prince your son.
Send straight for him.
Let him be crowned.
In him your comfort lives.
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave And plant your joys in living Edward’s throne.
Sister, have comfort.
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace.
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing.
God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast, Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.
Amen.
And make me die a good old man!
You cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other’s love.
Though we have spent our harvest of this king, We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancor of your high swoll'n hates, But lately splintered, knit, and joined together, Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.
Why “with some little train,” my Lord of Buckingham?
I hope the king made peace with all of us; And the compact is firm and true in me.
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.
And so say I.
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince, For God’s sake let not us two at home.
For by the way I’ll sort occasion, As index to the story we late talked of, To part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
I promise you I scarcely know myself.
Hear you the news abroad?
Yes, that the king is dead.
Ill news, by 'r Lady.
Seldom comes the better.
I fear, I fear, ’twill prove a giddy world.
Neighbors, God speed.
Give you good morrow, sir.
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death?
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
No, no, by God’s good grace, his son shall reign.
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.
Stood the state so?
No, no, good friends, God wot, For then this land was famously enriched With politic grave counsel; then the king Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Come, come, we fear the worst.
All will be well.
Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.
Ye cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and full of dread.
Before the days of change, still is it so.
By a divine instinct, men’s minds mistrust Ensuing dangers, as by proof we see The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
But leave it all to God.
Whither away?
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
And so was I.   I’ll bear you company.
Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford, And at Northampton they do rest tonight.
Tomorrow or next day they will be here.
I long with all my heart to see the prince.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
Why, my young cousin?
It is good to grow.
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered, I could have given my uncle’s grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.
How, my pretty York?
I prithee let me hear it.
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
Grandam, his nurse.
His nurse?
Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.
If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
A parlous boy!
Go to, you are too shrewd.
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
Pitchers have ears.
Here comes a messenger.
What news?
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
How doth the prince?
Well, madam, and in health.
What is thy news then?
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, And, with them, Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
Who hath committed them?
The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
For what offence?
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.
Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
Ay me!
I see the ruin of my house.
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.
Insulting tyranny begins to jut Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.
Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days, How many of you have mine eyes beheld?
Come, come, my boy.
We will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.
Stay, I will go with you.
You have no cause.
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way.
Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.
Welcome, my lord.
What, will our mother come?
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The Queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary.
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, But by his mother was perforce withheld.
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers!
Lord Cardinal, will your Grace Persuade the queen to send the duke of York Unto his princely brother presently?
You are too senseless obstinate, my lord, Too ceremonious and traditional.
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place.
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
I go, my lord.
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
Upon record, my gracious lord.
But say, my lord, it were not registered, Methinks the truth should live from age to age, As ’twere retailed to all posterity, Even to the general all ending day.
So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
What say you, uncle?
I say, without characters fame lives long.
Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity, I moralize two meanings in one word.
That Julius Caesar was a famous man.
With what his valor did enrich his wit, His wit set down to make his valor live.
What, my gracious lord?
Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
Now in good time here comes the duke of York.
Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
Well, my dread lord so must I call you now.
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
Too late he died that might have kept that title, Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
I thank you, gentle uncle.
O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
He hath, my lord.
And therefore is he idle?
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
He may command me as my sovereign, But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
My dagger, little cousin?
With all my heart.
A beggar, brother?
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.
A greater gift?
O, that’s the sword to it.
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.
In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
How?
Little.
My lord of York will still be cross in talk.
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
Because that I am little, like an ape, He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
With what a sharp provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
So cunning and so young is wonderful.
My lord, will ’t please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother, to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
My lord protector needs will have it so.
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Why, what should you fear?
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
I fear no uncles dead.
Nor none that live, I hope.
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
But come, my lord.
With a heavy heart, Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
Think you, my lord, this little prating York Was not incensèd by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
No doubt, no doubt.
O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.
Well, let them rest.
Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart.
Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way.
What thinkest thou?
Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the installment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle?
He, for his father’s sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.
What think’st thou then of Stanley?
Will not he?
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
Commend me to Lord William.
Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
You shall, my lord.
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
Chop off his head.
Something we will determine.
And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed.
I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hands.
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form.
My lord, my lord.
Who knocks?
One from the Lord Stanley.
What is ‘t o’clock?
Upon the stroke of four.
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
So it appears by that I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble self.
What then?
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm.
Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
Go, fellow, go.
Return unto thy lord.
Bid him not fear the separated council.
I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
Many good morrows to my noble lord.
Good morrow, Catesby.
You are early stirring.
What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?
How “wear the garland?” Dost thou mean the crown?
Ay, my good lord.
I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries.
But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side To bar my master’s heirs in true descent, God knows I will not do it, to the death.
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.
But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence, That they which brought me in my master’s hate, I live to look upon their tragedy.
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, When men are unprepared and look not for it.
O monstrous, monstrous!
I know they do, and I have well deserved it.
My lord, good morrow.
Good morrow, Catesby.
You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I.
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.
Think you but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am?
Come, come.
Have with you.
Wot you what, my lord?
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord, let’s away.
Go on before.
I’ll talk with this good fellow.
The better that your Lordship please to ask.
I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower By the suggestion of the queen’s allies.
But now, I tell thee keep it to thyself  This day those enemies are put to death, And I in better state than e'er I was.
God hold it, to your Honor’s good content!
Gramercy, fellow.
There, drink that for me.
I thank your Honor.
Well met, my lord.
I am glad to see your Honor.
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exercise.
Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.
I’ll wait upon your Lordship.
What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talk of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?
Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
And supper too, although thou know’st it not.
Come, will you go?
I’ll wait upon your Lordship.
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this: Today shalt thou behold a subject die For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
God bless the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers.
You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
Dispatch.
The limit of your lives is out.
O Pomfret, Pomfret!
O thou bloody prison, Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Now Margaret’s curse is fall'n upon our heads, When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I, For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.
Then cursed she Richard, then cursed she Buckingham.
Make haste.
The hour of death is expiate.
Come, Grey.
Come, Vaughan.
Let us all embrace.
Farewell until we meet in heaven.
Is all things ready for the royal time?
It is, and wants but nomination.
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.
Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?
Who is most inward with the noble duke?
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
I thank his Grace.
I know he loves me well.
But for his purpose in the coronation, I have not sounded him, nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein.
In happy time here comes the duke himself.
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded.
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder.
His Lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there; I do beseech you, send for some of them.
Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Withdraw yourself awhile.
I’ll go with you.
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden, For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be, were the day prolonged.
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester?
I have sent for these strawberries.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today?
I pray God he be not, I say.
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damnèd witchcraft, and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms?
The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
I say, my lord, they have deservèd death.
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
Look how I am bewitched!
If they have done this deed, my noble lord
If?
Woe, woe for England!
Not a whit for me, For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
Come, come, dispatch.
The duke would be at dinner.
Make a short shrift.
He longs to see your head.
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
Come, come, dispatch.
'Tis bootless to exclaim.
O bloody Richard!
Miserable England, I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon.
Come, lead me to the block.
Bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy color, Murder thy breath in the middle of a word, And then begin again, and stop again, As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
Lord Mayor
Look to the drawbridge there!
Hark, a drum!
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent
Look back!
Defend thee!
Here are enemies.
God and our innocence defend and guard us!
Be patient.
They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
So dear I loved the man that I must weep.
Well, well, he was the covert’st sheltered traitor That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe, Were ’t not that by great preservation We live to tell it, that subtle traitor This day had plotted, in the council house To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
Had he done so?
What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
Now fair befall you!
He deserved his death, And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mrs Shore.
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world.
Which since you come too late of our intent, Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.
There, at your meetest vantage of the time, Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children.
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crown meaning indeed his house, Which, by the sign thereof, was termèd so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust, Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, Even where his raging eye or savage heart, Without control, lusted to make his prey.
Doubt not, my lord.
I’ll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself.
And so, my lord, adieu.
Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
Go thou to Friar Penker.
Bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.
How now, how now?
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, The citizens are mum, say not a word.
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?
And did they so?
No.
What tongueless blocks were they!
Would not they speak?
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
The Mayor is here at hand.
Intend some fear; Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit.
I go.
An if you plead as well for them As I can say “nay” to thee for myself, No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
Go, go, up to the leads.
The Lord Mayor knocks.
He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord, To visit him tomorrow or next day.
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.
Tell him myself, the mayor, and aldermen, No less importing than our general good, In deep designs, and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace.
I’ll signify so much unto him straight.
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof.
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!
I fear he will.
Here Catesby comes again.
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His grace not being warned thereof before.
He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
See where his Grace stands, ’tween two clergymen.
My lord, there needs no such apology.
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungoverned isle.
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city’s eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
You have, my lord.
Would it might please your Grace, On our entreaties, to amend your fault.
My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace, But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, All circumstances well considerèd.
Do, good my lord.
Your citizens entreat you.
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.
O, make them joyful.
Grant their lawful suit.
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty.
I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham!
Call them again, sweet prince.
Accept their suit.
If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
Call them again.
God bless your Grace!
We see it and will say it.
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
Then I salute you with this royal title: Long live Richard, England’s worthy king!
Amen.
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, my cousin.
Farewell, gentle friends.
Who meets us here?
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower, On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.
Daughter, well met.
God give your Graces both A happy and a joyful time of day.
As much to you, good sister.
Whither away?
Kind sister, thanks.
We’ll enter all together.
Right well, dear madam.
By your patience, I may not suffer you to visit them.
The king hath strictly charged the contrary.
The king?
Who’s that?
I mean, the Lord Protector.
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
I am their mother.
Who shall bar me from them?
I am their father’s mother.
I will see them.
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
Then bring me to their sights.
I’ll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
No, madam, no.
I may not leave it so.
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence, And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, There to be crownèd Richard’s royal queen.
Ah, cut my lace asunder that my pent heart May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon With this dead killing news!
Despiteful tidings!
O, unpleasing news!
Be of good cheer, mother.
How fares your Grace?
O Dorset, speak not to me.
Get thee gone.
Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.
Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours.
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
O ill dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursèd womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world, Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
Come, madam, come.
I in all haste was sent.
And I in all unwillingness will go.
O, would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red hot steel to sear me to the brains!
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory.
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.
No?
Why?
Poor heart, adieu.
I pity thy complaining.
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.
Adieu, poor soul that tak’st thy leave of it.
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.
Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee.
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee.
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow For tender princes, use my babies well.
Stand all apart.
Cousin of Buckingham.
My gracious sovereign.
Give me thy hand.
Still live they, and forever let them last.
Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, To try if thou be current gold indeed.
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
Say on, my loving lord.
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king,
Why so you are, my thrice renownèd lord.
Ha!
Am I king?
'Tis so but Edward lives.
True, noble prince.
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live “true noble prince!
” Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
Shall I be plain?
I wish the bastards dead, And I would have it suddenly performed.
What sayest thou now?
Speak suddenly.
Your Grace may do your pleasure.
Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord, Before I positively speak in this.
I will resolve you herein presently.
The king is angry.
See, he gnaws his lip.
I will converse with iron witted fools And unrespective boys.
None are for me That look into me with considerate eyes.
High reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!
My lord?
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
Gold were as good as twenty orators, And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
What is his name?
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
I partly know the man.
Go, call him hither, boy
Know, my loving lord, The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
Come hither, Catesby.
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
I will take order for her keeping close.
Enquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look how thou dream’st!
I say again, give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.
About it, for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
Art thou indeed?
Prove me, my gracious lord.
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Please you.
But I had rather kill two enemies.
Why then, thou hast it.
Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.
Thou sing’st sweet music.
Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.
I will dispatch it straight.
My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.
Well, let that rest.
Dorset is fled to Richmond.
I hear the news, my lord.
Stanley, he is your wife’s son.
Well, look unto it.
My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, For which your honor and your faith is pawned  Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promisèd I shall possess.
Stanley, look to your wife.
If she convey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
What says your Highness to my just request?
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps
My lord
How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
My lord, your promise for the earldom
Richmond?
My Lord
Ay, what’s o'clock?
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me.
Well, but what’s o'clock?
Upon the stroke of ten.
Well, let it strike.
Why let it strike?
Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein today.
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
And is it thus?
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt?
Made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
But did’st thou see them dead?
I did, my lord.
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper, When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till then.
I humbly take my leave.
My lord!
Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly?
Bad news, my lord.
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash levied strength.
So now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Ah, my poor princes!
Hover about her; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night.
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe wearied tongue is still and mute.
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet; Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat, Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
If ancient sorrow be most reverend, Give mine the benefit of seigniory, And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society, Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.
O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch backed toad!
O, thou well skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.
My words are dull.
O, quicken them with thine!
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.
Why should calamity be full of words?
Windy attorneys to their clients' woes, Airy succeeders of intestate joys, Poor breathing orators of miseries, Let them have scope, though what they will impart Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.
If so, then be not tongue tied.
Go with me, And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered.
Who intercepts my expedition?
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet his son?
Where is gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
Where is kind Hastings?
A flourish, trumpets!
Strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.
Strike, I say!
Art thou my son?
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Then patiently hear my impatience.
Madam, I have a touch of your condition, Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
O, let me speak!
Do then, but I’ll not hear.
I will be mild and gentle in my words.
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.
Art thou so hasty?
I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony.
And came I not at last to comfort you?
No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well.
Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell.
Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your Grace To breakfast once, forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your eye, Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
Strike up the drum.
I prithee, hear me speak.
You speak too bitterly.
Hear me a word, For I shall never speak to thee again.
So.
Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And nevermore behold thy face again.
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me.
I say amen to her.
Stay, madam.
I must talk a word with you.
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter.
You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
And must she die for this?
O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy.
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter, I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.
Wrong not her birth.
She is a royal princess.
To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.
Her life is safest only in her birth.
And only in that safety died her brothers.
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts, Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!
What good is covered with the face of heaven, To be discovered, that can do me good?
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.
Unto the dignity and height of fortune, The high imperial type of this earth’s glory.
Flatter my sorrow with report of it.
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor, Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.
What do you think?
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter And do intend to make her Queen of England.
Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
Even he that makes her queen.
Who else should be?
What, thou?
Even so.
How think you of it?
How canst thou woo her?
That would I learn of you, As one being best acquainted with her humor.
And wilt thou learn of me?
Madam, with all my heart.
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave “Edward” and “York.
” Then haply she will weep.
You mock me, madam.
This is not the way To win your daughter.
There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this.
Say that I did all this for love of her.
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
Look what is done cannot be now amended.
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons, To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter.
What were I best to say?
Her father’s brother Would be her lord?
Or shall I say her uncle?
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance.
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
Tell her the king, that may command, entreats
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
To vail the title, as her mother doth.
Say I will love her everlastingly.
But how long shall that title “ever” last?
Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end.
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead  Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
Harp on it still shall I till heart strings break.
Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown
Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.
I swear
By nothing, for this is no oath.
Then, by myself
Thyself is self misused.
Now, by the world
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
My father’s death
Thy life hath it dishonored.
Why then, by God.
God’s wrong is most of all.
The time to come.
As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms!
Myself myself confound, Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours, Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest, Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if, with dear heart’s love, Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
In her consists my happiness and thine.
Without her follows to myself and thee, Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, Death, desolation, ruin and decay.
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
Shall I forget myself to be myself?
Ay, if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself.
Yet thou didst kill my children.
But in your daughter’s womb I bury them, Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
And be a happy mother by the deed.
I go.
Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind.
Bear her my true love’s kiss; and so, farewell.
Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy.
Some light foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk  Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby.
Where is he?
Here, my good lord.
Catesby, fly to the duke.
I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.
Ratcliffe, come hither.
Post to Salisbury.
When thou com’st thither    Dull, unmindful villain, Why stay’st thou here and go’st not to the duke?
First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure, What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
O true, good Catesby.
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
I go.
What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
Your Highness told me I should post before.
My mind is changed.
None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing, Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
Hoyday, a riddle!
Neither good nor bad.
What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
Once more, what news?
Richmond is on the seas.
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White livered runagate, what doth he there?
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
Well, as you guess?
Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, He makes for England, here to claim the crown.
Is the chair empty?
Is the sword unswayed?
Is the king dead, the empire unpossessed?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
Unless for that he comes to be your liege, You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
No, my good lord.
Therefore mistrust me not.
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe conducting the rebels from their ships?
No, my good lord.
My friends are in the north.
Cold friends to me.
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
They have not been commanded, mighty king.
Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond, But I’ll not trust thee.
Most mighty sovereign, You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
I never was nor never will be false.
Go then and muster men, but leave behind Your son George Stanley.
So deal with him as I prove true to you.
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, As I by friends am well advertisèd, Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate, Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother, With many more confederates are in arms.
My lord, the army of great Buckingham
Out on you, owls!
Nothing but songs of death.
There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
I cry thee mercy.
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well advisèd friend proclaimed Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.
Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset, 'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.
My liege, the duke of Buckingham is taken.
That is the best news.
That the earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford, Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
Away towards Salisbury!
While we reason here, A royal battle might be won and lost.
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury.
The rest march on with me.
At Pembroke, or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales.
What men of name resort to him?
Well, hie thee to thy lord.
I kiss his hand.
My letter will resolve him of my mind.
Farewell.
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
No, my good lord.
Therefore be patient.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Grey and Rivers, Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan, and all that have miscarrièd By underhand, corrupted, foul injustice, If that your moody, discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour, Even for revenge mock my destruction.
This is All Souls' Day, fellow, is it not?
It is.
Why, then All Souls' Day is my body’s doomsday.
This is the day which, in King Edward’s time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies.
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted.
This, this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs.
Every man’s conscience is a thousand men, To fight against this guilty homicide.
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
All for our vantage.
Then, in God’s name, march.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings.
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
My Lord of Norfolk
Here, most gracious liege.
Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not?
We must both give and take, my loving lord.
Up with my tent!
Here will I lie tonight.
But where tomorrow?
Well, all’s one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
Why, our battalia trebles that account.
Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with the tent!
Come, noble gentlemen, Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
Call for some men of sound direction.
If without peril it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it.
And so God give you quiet rest tonight!
Good night, good Captain Blunt.
What is “t o”clock?
It’s suppertime, my lord.
It’s nine o'clock.
I will not sup tonight.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armor laid into my tent?
It is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.
Use careful watch.
Choose trusty sentinels.
I go, my lord.
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.
I warrant you, my lord.
Catesby.
My lord.
Send out a pursuivant at arms To Stanley’s regiment.
Bid him bring his power Before sunrising, lest his son George fall Into the blind cave of eternal night.
My lord.
Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself, Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers.
So, I am satisfied.
Give me a bowl of wine.
I have not that alacrity of spirit Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
Set it down.
Is ink and paper ready?
It is, my lord.
Bid my guard watch.
Leave me.
Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me.
Leave me, I say.
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person, noble father in law.
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!
Think how thou stabbed’st me in my prime of youth At Tewkesbury.
Despair therefore, and die!
Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wrongèd souls Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf.
King Henry’s issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
When I was mortal, my anointed body By thee was punchèd full of deadly holes.
Think on the Tower and me.
Despair, and die!
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror.
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king, Doth comfort thee in thy sleep.
Live and flourish.
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow, Rivers, that died at Pomfret.
Despair, and die!
Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!
Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance.
Despair, and die!
Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom Will conquer him!
Awake, and win the day.
Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard, And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death.
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.
Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy.
Live, and beget a happy race of kings.
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake, And in a bloody battle end thy days.
Think on Lord Hastings.
Despair and die!
Quiet, untroubled soul, awake, awake.
Arm, fight, and conquer for fair England’s sake.
Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife, That never slept a quiet hour with thee, Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
The last was I that helped thee to the crown; The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
O, in the battle think on Buckingham, And die in terror of thy guiltiness.
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath.
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid, But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed.
God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side, And Richard fall in height of all his pride.
Give me another horse!
Bind up my wounds!
Have mercy, Jesu!
Soft, I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue.
It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear?
Myself?
There’s none else by.
Richard loves Richard; that is, I and I.
Is there a murderer here?
No.
Yes, I am.
Then fly!
What, from myself?
Great reason why: Lest I revenge.
What, myself upon myself?
Alack, I love myself.
Wherefore?
For any good That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no!
Alas, I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself.
I am a villain.
Yet I lie.
I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well.
My lord.
Zounds, who is there?
Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I.
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn.
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!
What think’st thou, will our friends prove all true?
No doubt, my lord.
O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear.
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
'Tis not yet near day.
Come, go with me; Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me.
Good morrow, Richmond.
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
How have you slept, my lord?
The sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory.
I promise you, my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?
Upon the stroke of four.
Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
That he was never trainèd up in arms.
He said the truth.
And what said Surrey then?
He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.
He was in the right, and so indeed it is.
Not I, my lord.
My lord.
The sun will not be seen today.
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine today?
Arm, arm, my lord.
The foe vaunts in the field.
Come, bustle, bustle.
Caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley; bid him bring his power.
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
My lord, he doth deny to come.
Off with his son George’s head!
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
Advance our standards.
Set upon our foes.
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.
Upon them!
Victory sits on our helms.
Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man, Daring an opposite to every danger.
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
Withdraw, my lord.
I’ll help you to a horse.
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast, And I will stand the hazard of the die.
I think there be six Richmonds in the field; Five have I slain today instead of him.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!
The day is ours; the bloody dog is dead.
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here this long usurpèd royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Great God of heaven, say amen to all!
But tell me, is young George Stanley living?
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town, Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
What men of name are slain on either side?
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us.
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, We will unite the white rose and the red.
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, That long have frowned upon their enmity.
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
No, for then we should be colliers.
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
I strike quickly, being moved.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
A dog of the house of MONTAGUE moves me.
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st away.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
‘Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall.
Therefore I will push MONTAGUE’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
‘Tis all one.
I will show myself a tyrant.
When I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids.
The heads of the maids?
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
My naked weapon is out.
Quarrel!
I will back thee.
How?
Turn thy back and run?
Fear me not.
No, marry.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Nay, as they dare.
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Is the law of our side if I say “ay”?
No.
No, sir.
Do you quarrel, sir?
But if you do, sir, I am for you.
I serve as good a man as you.
Well, sir.
Say “better.
” Here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.
Yes, better, sir.
Draw, if you be men.
Gregory, remember thy washing blow.
Part, fools!
Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
I do but keep the peace.
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.
Clubs, bills, and partisans!
Strike!
Beat them down!
Down with the CAPULETs!
Down with the MONTAGUEs!
What noise is this?
Give me my long sword, ho!
A crutch, a crutch!
Why call you for a sword?
My sword, I say!
Old MONTAGUE is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Thou villain CAPULET!
Hold me not.
Let me go.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew.
Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them.
Oh, where is ROMEO?
Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends.
See, where he comes.
So please you, step aside.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift.
Come, madam, let’s away.
Good morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
But new struck nine.
Ay me!
Sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was.
What sadness lengthens ROMEO’s hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out.
Of love?
Out of her favor, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine?
O me!
What fray was here?
No, coz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart’s oppression.
Why, such is love’s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate, to have it pressed With more of thine.
This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Soft!
I will go along.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself.
I am not here.
This is not ROMEO.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Groan!
Why, no.
But sadly, tell me who.
A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good markman!
And she’s fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss.
She’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow.
She hath Dian’s wit.
And, in strong proof of chastity well armed From love’s weak childish bow, she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Be ruled by me.
Forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.
‘Tis the way To call hers exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.
But MONTAGUE is bound as well as I, In penalty alike.
And ’tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.
Of honorable reckoning are you both.
And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
But saying o’er what I have said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
And too soon marred are those so early made.
Find them out whose names are written here?
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
Tut man, one fire burns out another’s burning.
One pain is lessened by another’s anguish.
Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
For what, I pray thee?
For your broken shin.
Why ROMEO, art thou mad?
God ‘i’ good e’en.
I pray, sir, can you read?
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Ye say honestly.
Rest you merry.
Stay, fellow.
I can read.
Up.
Whither?
To supper; to our house.
Whose house?
My master’s.
Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.
Now I’ll tell you without asking.
At this same ancient feast of CAPULET’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona.
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come.
What, lamb!
What, ladybird!
God forbid!
Where’s this girl?
What, JULIET!
How now, who calls?
Your mother.
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
She’s not fourteen.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four she is not fourteen.
How long is it now to Lammastide?
A fortnight and odd days.
Enough of this.
I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Yes, madam.
Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say “ay.
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
Peace, I have done.
God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nursed.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
Marry, that “marry” is the very theme I came to talk of.
Tell me, daughter JULIET, How stands your disposition to be married?
It is an honor that I dream not of.
An honor!
Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat.
Well, think of marriage now.
Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem Are made already mothers.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A man, young lady!
Lady, such a man As all the world.
Why, he’s a man of wax.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, he’s a flower.
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast.
No less?
Nay, bigger.
Women grow by men.
Speak briefly.
Can you like of Paris, love?
We follow thee.
JULIET, the county stays.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?
The date is out of such prolixity.
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath, Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper, Nor no without book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter for our entrance.
But let them measure us by what they will.
We’ll measure them a measure and be gone.
Give me a torch.
I am not for this ambling.
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
Nay, gentle ROMEO, we must have you dance.
Not I, believe me.
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
You are a lover.
Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound.
And to sink in it, should you burthen love  Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Is love a tender thing?
It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in!
A visor for a visor.
What care I What curious eye doth cote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
Come, knock and enter.
And no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs.
A torch for me.
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.
For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase, I’ll be a candle holder, and look on.
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word.
Nay, that’s not so.
And we mean well in going to this mask, But ’tis no wit to go.
Why, may one ask?
I dreamt a dream tonight.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Queen Mab, what’s she
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk’st of nothing.
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Strike, drum.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
He shift a trencher?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.
Away with the joint stools, remove the court cupboard, look to the plate.
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony and Potpan!
Ay, boy, ready.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.
We cannot be here and there too.
Cheerly, boys.
Be brisk a while, and the longer liver take all.
Welcome, gentlemen!
Ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with you.
Ah, my mistresses!
Which of you all Will now deny to dance?
She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns.
Am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen!
I have seen the day That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear Such as would please.
‘Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.
Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall, give room!
And foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves!
By’r Lady, thirty years.
‘Tis more, ’tis more.
His son is elder, sir.
His son is thirty.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
What lady is that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight?
I know not, sir.
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
This, by his voice, should be a MONTAGUE.
Fetch me my rapier, boy.
What, dares the slave Come hither, covered with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honor of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
Why, how now, kinsman?
Wherefore storm you so?
Young ROMEO is it?
‘Tis he, that villain ROMEO.
Content thee, gentle coz.
Let him alone.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well governed youth.
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient.
Take no note of him.
It is my will, the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill beseeming semblance for a feast.
It fits when such a villain is a guest.
I’ll not endure him.
He shall be endured.
What, goodman boy!
I say, he shall.
Go to.
Am I the master here, or you?
Go to.
You’ll not endure him!
God shall mend my soul, You’ll make a mutiny among my guests.
You will set cock a hoop.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
Go to, go to.
You are a saucy boy.
Is ’t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
Patience perforce with willful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.
Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from thy lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.
You kiss by th’ book.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
What is her mother?
Is she a CAPULET?
O dear account!
My life is my foe’s debt.
Ay, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e’en so?
Why, then, I thank you all.
I thank you, honest gentlemen.
Good night.
More torches here!
Come on then, let’s to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.
I’ll to my rest.
Come hither, Nurse.
What is yond gentleman?
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
What’s he that now is going out of door?
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
I know not.
Go ask his name.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
What’s this?
What’s this?
A rhyme I learned even now Of one I danced withal.
Anon, anon.
Come, let's away.
The strangers are all gone.
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, And young affection gapes to be his heir.
That fair for which love groaned for and would die, With tender JULIET matched, is now not fair.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.
ROMEO, my cousin ROMEO!
ROMEO!
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
Call, good Mercutio.
Nay, I’ll conjure too!
ROMEO!
Humours, madman, passion, lover!
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
This cannot anger him.
To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and JULIET is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.
Cast it off!
It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love.
Oh, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing.
What of that?
Her eye discourses.
I will answer it.
I am too bold.
Ay me!
She speaks.
O, speak again, bright angel!
For thou art As glorious to this night, being o’er my head, As is a wingèd messenger of heaven Unto the white, upturnèd, wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O ROMEO, ROMEO!
Wherefore art thou ROMEO?
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a MONTAGUE.
What’s MONTAGUE?
It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man.
O, be some other name!
What’s in a name?
That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet.
So ROMEO would, were he not ROMEO called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title.
ROMEO, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee Take all myself.
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized.
Henceforth I never will be ROMEO.
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not ROMEO, and a MONTAGUE?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
If they do see thee they will murder thee.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot.
Yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit tree tops
O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circle orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What shall I swear by?
Do not swear at all.
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe thee.
If my heart’s dear love
Well, do not swear.
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.
The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.
O blessèd, blessèd night!
Three words, dear ROMEO, and good night indeed.
Madam!
I come, anon.
But if thou mean’st not well, I do beseech thee
Madam!
By and by, I come.
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send.
So thrive my soul
A thousand times good night!
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Hist!
ROMEO, hist!
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
ROMEO!
My nyas?
What o’clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
I will not fail.
‘Tis twenty year till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Remembering how I love thy company.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.
‘Tis almost morning.
I would have thee gone.
I would I were thy bird.
Sweet, so would I.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night!
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Good morrow, Father.
Benedicite.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
That last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?
That’s my good son.
But where hast thou been, then?
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, That’s by me wounded.
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich CAPULET.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken?
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.
Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
And badest me bury love.
Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have.
I pray thee, chide not.
Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.
Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
Oh, let us hence.
I stand on sudden haste.
Wisely and slow.
They stumble that run fast.
Where the devil should this ROMEO be?
Came he not home tonight?
Not to his father’s.
I spoke with his man.
Why, that same pale hard hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old CAPULET, Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.
A challenge, on my life.
ROMEO will answer it.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
Alas, poor ROMEO!
Why, what is Tybalt?
More than Prince of Cats.
Oh, he’s the courageous captain of compliments.
He fights as you sing prick song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.
He rests his minim rests one, two, and the third in your bosom.
The what?
The pox on such antic, lisping, affecting fantasmines, these new tuners of accents!
Here comes ROMEO, here comes ROMEO.
Without his roe, like a dried herring.
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning “to curtsy”?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
O single soled jest, solely singular for the singleness.
Come between us, good Benvolio.
My wits faints.
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry a match.
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Nay, good goose, bite not.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.
It is a most sharp sauce.
And is it not well served into a sweet goose?
Oh, here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
Now art thou sociable.
Now art thou ROMEO.
Stop there, stop there.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Oh, thou art deceived.
Here’s goodly gear.
A sail, a sail!
Peter!
Anon!
My fan, Peter.
Good, Peter, to hide her face, for her fan’s the fairer face.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
God ye good e’en, fair gentlewoman.
Is it good e’en?
Out upon you!
What a man are you?
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself to mar.
By my troth, it is well said.
“For himself to mar,” quoth he?
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young ROMEO?
I can tell you, but young ROMEO will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him.
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
You say well.
Yea, is the worst well?
Very well took, i’ faith, wisely, wisely.
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
She will indite him to some supper.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!
So ho!
What hast thou found?
No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten pie that is, something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
I will follow you.
Farewell, ancient lady.
Farewell, lady, lady, lady.
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?
An he speak any thing against me, I’ll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks.
And if I cannot, I’ll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave!
I am none of his flirt gills.
I am none of his skains mates.
And thou must stand by, too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers.
Scurvy knave!
Pray you, sir, a word.
And as I told you, my young lady bid me inquire you out.
What she bade me say, I will keep to myself.
But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool’s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say.
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
I protest unto thee
Good heart, and i’ faith, I will tell her as much.
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse?
Thou dost not mark me.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon.
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell Be shrived and married.
Here is for thy pains.
No, truly, sir.
Not a penny.
Go to.
This afternoon, sir?
Well, she shall be there.
And stay, good Nurse.
Now God in heaven bless thee!
Hark you, sir.
What sayst thou, my dear Nurse?
Is your man secret?
Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Ay, Nurse, what of that?
Both with an R.
Ah, mocker, that’s the dog’s name.
Commend me to thy lady.
Ay, a thousand times  Peter!
Anon!
Before, and apace.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him.
That’s not so.
Oh, she is lame!
Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.
Peter, stay at the gate.
Now, good sweet Nurse  O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
I am aweary.
Give me leave awhile.
Fie, how my bones ache!
What a jaunt have I!
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak.
Good, good Nurse, speak.
Jesu, what haste!
Can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad?
Answer to that.
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied.
Is ’t good or bad?
Well, you have made a simple choice.
You know not how to choose a man.
ROMEO!
No, no.
But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage?
What of that?
Lord, how my head aches!
What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back a’ t’ other side.
Ah, my back, my back!
I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother?
Why, she is within.
Where should she be?
How oddly thou repliest!
“Your love says, like an honest gentleman, ‘Where is your mother?’”
O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot?
Marry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here’s such a coil.
Come, what says ROMEO?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
I have.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church.
I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
Hie to high fortune!
Honest Nurse, farewell.
So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after hours with sorrow chide us not.
Amen, amen.
But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
ROMEO shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
They are but beggars that can count their worth.
But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee!
” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.
Am I like such a fellow?
And what to?
The fee simple?
O simple!
By my head, here comes the CAPULETs.
By my heel, I care not.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good e’en.
A word with one of you.
And but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something.
Make it a word and a blow.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Mercutio, thou consort’st with ROMEO.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.
Here all eyes gaze on us.
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
Well, peace be with you, sir.
Here comes my man.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.
Your worship in that sense may call him “man.
”
ROMEO, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.
Villain am I none.
Therefore, farewell.
I see thou know’st me not.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.
Therefore turn and draw.
O calm dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
What wouldst thou have with me?
I am for you.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
Come, sir, your passado.
Away, Tybalt.
I am hurt.
A plague o’ both your houses!
I am sped.
Is he gone and hath nothing?
What, art thou hurt?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.
Marry, ’tis enough.
Where is my page?
Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Courage, man.
The hurt cannot be much.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.
A plague o’ both your houses!
I thought all for the best.
Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.
A plague o’ both your houses!
They have made worms’ meat of me.
I have it, And soundly too.
Your houses!
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally, My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf.
My reputation stained With Tybalt’s slander.
O ROMEO, ROMEO, brave Mercutio is dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.
This but begins the woe others must end.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Alive in triumph and Mercutio slain!
This shall determine that.
ROMEO, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed.
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.
Hence, be gone, away!
Oh, I am fortune’s fool!
Why dost thou stay?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
There lies that Tybalt.
Up, sir, go with me.
I charge thee in the Prince’s name, obey.
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young ROMEO, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
Tybalt, my cousin!
O my brother’s child!
O Prince!
O cousin!
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Tybalt here slain, whom ROMEO’s hand did slay.
He is a kinsman to the MONTAGUE.
Affection makes him false.
He speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
ROMEO slew Tybalt.
ROMEO must not live.
ROMEO slew him; he slew Mercutio.
Not ROMEO, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend.
And for that offense Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding; My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a bleeding.
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
Gallop apace, you fiery footed steeds, Toward Phoebus’ lodging.
Such a wagoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love performing night, That runaways’ eyes may wink, and ROMEO Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night.
Ay, ay, the cords.
Ay me, what news?
Why dost thou wring thy hands?
Ah, weraday!
He’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day!
He’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead!
Can heaven be so envious?
ROMEO can, Though heaven cannot.
O ROMEO, ROMEO!
Who ever would have thought it?
ROMEO!
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
Hath ROMEO slain himself?
Say thou but “ay,” And that bare vowel I shall poison more Than the death darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if there be such an I, Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “ay.
” If he be slain, say “ay,” or if not, “no.
” Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
O, break, my heart, poor bankrupt, break at once!
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt!
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is ROMEO slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?
Tybalt is gone, and ROMEO banishèd.
ROMEO that killed him he is banishèd.
O God, did ROMEO’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
It did, it did.
Alas the day, it did.
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant!
Fiend angelical!
Dove feathered raven, wolvish ravening lamb!
Despisèd substance of divinest show, Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st.
A damnèd saint, an honorable villain!
There’s no trust, No faith, no honesty in men.
All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man?
Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish!
He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three hours’ wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring.
Your tributary drops belong to woe, Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Will you go to them?
I will bring you thither.
Wash they his wounds with tears?
Hie to your chamber.
I’ll find ROMEO To comfort you.
I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your ROMEO will be here at night.
I’ll to him.
He is hid at Lawrence’ cell.
O, find him!
ROMEO, come forth.
Come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity.
Father, what news?
What is the Prince’s doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand That I yet know not?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
Ha, banishment!
Hence from Verona art thou banishèd.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
O deadly sin!
O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law, And turned that black word “death” to “banishment.
” This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
‘Tis torture and not mercy.
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
Oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word  Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy  To comfort thee though thou art banishèd.
Oh, then I see that madmen have no ears.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Arise.
One knocks.
Good ROMEO, hide thyself.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.
Hark, how they knock!
Who’s there?
ROMEO, arise.
Thou wilt be taken.
Stay awhile.
Stand up.
Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
I come from Lady JULIET.
Welcome then.
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Oh, he is even in my mistress’ case, Just in her case.
O woeful sympathy, Piteous predicament!
Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Nurse!
Ah sir, ah sir.
Death’s the end of all.
Spakest thou of JULIET?
How is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer, Now I have stained the childhood of our joy With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she?
And how doth she?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman.
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion.
Hold thy desperate hand.
Art thou a man?
Thy form cries out thou art.
Thy tears are womanish.
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man, And ill beseeming beast in seeming both!
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel.
Oh, what learning is!
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
How well my comfort is revived by this!
Go hence.
Good night.
And here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua.
I’ll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here.
Give me thy hand.
‘Tis late.
Farewell, good night.
Things have fall’n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I.
Well, we were born to die.
‘Tis very late.
She’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but for your company, I would have been abed an hour ago.
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night.
Commend me to your daughter.
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love.
I think she will be ruled In all respects by me.
Nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.
Monday, my lord.
Monday!
Ha, ha.
Well, Wednesday is too soon, O’ Thursday let it be.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
Well, get you gone.
O' Thursday be it then.
Wilt thou be gone?
It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale.
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet.
Thou need’st not to be gone.
Let me be ta’en.
Let me be put to death.
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye.
‘Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
JULIET wills it so.
How is ’t, my soul?
Let’s talk.
It is not day.
It is, it is.
Hie hence!
Be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
Some say the lark and loathèd toad change eyes.
Oh, now I would they had changed voices too, Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt’s up to the day.
O, now be gone.
More light and light it grows.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!
Madam.
Nurse?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
The day is broke.
Be wary, look about.
Then, window, let day in and let life out.
Farewell, farewell.
One kiss, and I’ll descend.
Art thou gone so, love, lord?
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
Oh, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?
O God, I have an ill divining soul.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
Adieu, adieu!
O Fortune, Fortune!
All men call thee fickle.
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renowned for faith?
Ho, daughter, are you up?
Who is ’t that calls?
Is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late or up so early?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
Why, how now, JULIET?
Madam, I am not well.
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Therefore, have done.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.
Feeling so the loss, Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
What villain, madam?
That same villain, ROMEO.
Villain and he be many miles asunder.
God pardon him!
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Then weep no more.
I’ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, beseech your ladyship?
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect’st not, nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
Here comes your father.
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
How, how, how, how?
Chopped logic!
What is this?
Fie, fie!
What, are you mad?
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
Hang thee, young baggage!
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?
Hold your tongue, Good prudence.
Smatter with your gossips, go.
I speak no treason.
Oh, God ‘i’ good e’en.
May not one speak?
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.
You are too hot.
God’s bread!
It makes me mad.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
O God!
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?
Comfort me.
Counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself.
What sayst thou?
Hast thou not a word of joy?
Faith, here it is.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.
Amen!
What?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved.
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.
Ancient damnation!
O most wicked fiend!
On Thursday, sir?
The time is very short.
My father CAPULET will have it so, And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Uneven is the course.
I like it not.
I would I knew not why it should be slowed.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
Happily met, my lady and my wife.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday next.
What must be shall be.
That’s a certain text.
Come you to make confession to this Father?
To answer that, I should confess to you.
Do not deny to him that you love me.
I will confess to you that I love him.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
The tears have got small victory by that, For it was bad enough before their spite.
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
God shield I should disturb devotion!
JULIET, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
O, shut the door!
O JULIET, I already know thy grief.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
God joined my heart and ROMEO’s, thou our hands.
Hold, daughter.
Hold, then.
Go home, be merry.
Give consent To marry Paris.
Give me, give me!
O, tell not me of fear!
Hold.
Get you gone.
Be strong and prosperous In this resolve.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
How canst thou try them so?
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers.
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
Go, be gone.
Ay, forsooth.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
A peevish self willed harlotry it is.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
How now, my headstrong?
Where have you been gadding?
Send for the county.
Go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
Why, I am glad on ’t.
This is well.
Stand up.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
No, not till Thursday.
There is time enough.
Go, Nurse.
Go with her.
We’ll to church tomorrow.
We shall be short in our provision.
‘Tis now near night.
Ay, those attires are best.
What, are you busy, ho?
Need you my help?
No, madam.
We have culled such necessaries As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.
Good night.
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
Farewell.
God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I'll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!
What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
No, no, this shall forbid it.
Lie thou there.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Come, stir, stir, stir!
The second cock hath crowed.
The curfew bell hath rung.
‘Tis three o’clock.
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.
Spare not for the cost.
Go, you cot quean, go.
Get you to bed, faith.
You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching.
No, not a whit, what.
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.
Make haste, make haste, sirrah.
Mass, and well said!
A merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be loggerhead.
Good faith, 'tis day.
Mistress!
What, mistress!
JULIET!
Fast, I warrant her, she.
Why, lamb!
Why, lady!
Fie, you slug a bed.
Why, love, I say.
Madam!
Sweet heart!
Why, bride!
What, not a word?
You take your pennyworths now.
Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant, The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little.
God forgive me, Marry, and amen.
How sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her.
Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed.
He’ll fright you up, i’ faith.
Will it not be?
What noise is here?
O lamentable day!
What is the matter?
Look, look.
O heavy day!
O me, O me!
My child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help!
Call help.
For shame, bring JULIET forth.
Her lord is come.
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
Alack the day!
Alack the day.
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
Ha?
Let me see her.
Out, alas!
She’s cold.
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
O lamentable day!
O woeful time.
Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son!
The night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy wife.
There she lies, Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son in law.
Death is my heir.
My daughter he hath wedded.
I will die, And leave him all.
Life, living, all is Death’s.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e’er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
O woe!
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
Beguiled, divorcèd, wrongèd, spited, slain!
Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child, O child!
My soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou!
Peace, ho, for shame!
Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions.
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid.
Now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid.
All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral.
Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Musicians, O musicians, “Heart’s Ease,” “Heart’s Ease.
” O, an you will have me live, play “Heart’s Ease.
Why “Heart’s ease?”
O musicians, because my heart itself plays “My Heart is Full.
” O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
Not a dump, we.
‘Tis no time to play now.
You will not then?
No.
I will then give it you soundly.
What will you give us?
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.
I will give you the minstrel.
Then I will give you the serving creature.
Then will I lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate.
I will carry no crotchets.
I’ll re you, I’ll fa you.
Do you note me?
An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Pray you, put up your dagger and put out your wit.
Then have at you with my wit.
I will dry beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger.
Answer me like men.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Pretty.
What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
I say, “silver sound” because musicians sound for silver.
Pretty too.
What say you, James Soundpost?
Faith, I know not what to say.
Oh, I cry you mercy, you are the singer.
I will say for you.
What a pestilent knave is this same!
Hang him, jack!
Come, we'll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne, And all this day an unaccustomed spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you.
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Is it e’en so?
Then I defy you, stars!
Thou know’st my lodging.
Get me ink and paper, And hire post horses.
I will hence tonight.
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceived.
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
No, my good lord.
No matter.
Get thee gone, And hire those horses.
I’ll be with thee straight.
Who calls so loud?
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.
Hold, there is forty ducats.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear’st to die?
Famine is in thy cheeks.
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes.
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
Holy Franciscan Friar!
Brother, ho!
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua.
What says ROMEO?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Who bare my letter, then, to ROMEO?
Unhappy fortune!
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair JULIET wake.
She will beshrew me much that ROMEO Hath had no notice of these accidents.
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till ROMEO come.
Poor living corpse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Give me thy torch, boy.
Hence, and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard.
Yet I will adventure.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew  O woe!
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter.
Early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light.
Upon thy life I charge thee, Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof, And do not interrupt me in my course.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
So shalt thou show me friendship.
Take thou that.
Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
Fly hence and leave me.
Think upon these gone.
Let them affright thee.
Wilt thou provoke me?
Then have at thee, boy!
O Lord, they fight!
I will go call the watch.
Oh, I am slain!
If thou be merciful, Open the tomb.
Lay me with JULIET.
In faith, I will.
Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris.
What said my man, when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode?
I think He told me Paris should have married JULIET.
Saint Francis be my speed!
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves!
Who’s there?
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Bliss be upon you!
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love.
Who is it?
ROMEO.
How long hath he been there?
Full half an hour.
Go with me to the vault.
I dare not, sir.
Stay, then.
I’ll go alone.
Fear comes upon me.
Oh, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.
ROMEO!
O comfortable Friar!
Where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
Where is my ROMEO?
I hear some noise.
Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.
Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What’s here?
A cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
Lead, boy.
Which way?
Yea, noise?
Then I’ll be brief.
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.
There rust and let me die.
This is the place.
There, where the torch doth burn.
The ground is bloody.
Search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you.
Whoe’er you find, attach.
Here’s ROMEO’s man.
We found him in the churchyard.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.
A great suspicion.
Stay the friar too.
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest?
What should it be, that they shriek so abroad?
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
O heavens!
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
O me!
This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Look, and thou shalt see.
O thou untaught!
What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave?
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemnèd and myself excused.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s ROMEO’s man?
What can he say in this?
Give me the letter.
I will look on it.
Where is the county’s page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
O brother MONTAGUE, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand.
As rich shall ROMEO’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.
I am not partial to infringe our laws.
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou dep artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
Nay, forward, old man.
Do not break off so, For we may pity though not pardon thee.
O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us.
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
I will, my lord.
Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.
Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed, having so good a mean.
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me?
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants, Of whom I hope to make much benefit.
I crave your pardon.
Soon at five o'clock, Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime.
My present business calls me from you now.
Farewell till then.
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city.
Sir, I commend you to your own content.
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
Returned so soon?
Rather approach’d too late!
Stop in your wind, sir.
O, sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
I am not in a sportive humor now.
Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?
We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?
I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
To me, sir?
Why, you gave no gold to me!
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders, But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again, Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
Thy mistress' marks?
what mistress, slave, hast thou?
Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix, She that doth fast till you come home to dinner And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid?
There, take you that, sir knave.

What mean you, sir?
For God’s sake, hold your hands.
Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret.
A man is master of his liberty; Time is their master, and when they see time They’ll go or come.
If so, be patient, sister.
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
Because their business still lies out o' door.
Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
There’s none but asses will be bridled so.
Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.
There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
The beasts, the fishes, and the wingèd fowls Are their males' subjects and at their controls.
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.
How if your husband start some otherwhere?
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
Patience unmoved!
No marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry, But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more we should ourselves complain.
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man.
Now is your husband nigh.
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.
Say, didst thou speak with him?
Know’st thou his mind?
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?
Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad.
Horn mad, thou villain!
I mean not cuckold mad, But sure he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner, He asked me for a thousand marks in gold.
“'Tis dinnertime,” quoth I.
“My gold,” quoth he.
“Your meat doth burn,” quoth I.
“My gold,” quoth he.
“Will you come?” quoth I.
“My gold,” quoth he.
Quoth who?
Quoth my master.
“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.
” So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders, For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
Go back again and be new beaten home?
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
Hence, prating peasant!
Fetch thy master home.
Am I so round with you as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.
His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek?
Then he hath wasted it.
Are my discourses dull?
Barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marred, Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.
What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruined?
Then is he the ground Of my defeatures.
My decayèd fair A sunny look of his would soon repair.
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home.
Self harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.
Would that alone o' love he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.
I see the jewel best enamelèd Will lose his beauty.
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wandered forth, in care to seek me out.
What answer, sir?
When spake I such a word?
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner, For which, I hope, thou felt’st I was displeased.
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
What means this jest?
I pray you, master, tell me?
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think’st thou I jest?
Hold, take thou that and that.
Hold, sir, for God’s sake!
Now your jest is earnest.
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours.
“Sconce” call you it?
So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a “head.
” An you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
Dost thou not know?
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
Shall I tell you why?
Ay, sir, and wherefore, for they say every why hath a wherefore.
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the “why” and the “wherefore” is neither rhyme nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.
Thank me, sir, for what?
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something.
But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.
In good time, sir, what’s that?
Basting.
Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
Your reason?
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting.
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time.
There’s a time for all things.
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.
By what rule, sir?
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
Let’s hear it.
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit.
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost.
Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
For what reason?
For two, and sound ones too.
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
Sure ones, then.
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
Certain ones, then.
Name them.
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.
I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion: But soft, who wafts us yonder?
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet savored in thy taste, Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thy "self" I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self’s better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
Plead you to me, fair dame?
I know you not.
Fie, brother, how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
By Dromio?
By me?
By thee; and this thou didst return from him: That he did buffet thee and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?
I, sir?
I never saw her till this time.
I never spake with her in all my life.
How can she thus then call us by our names  Unless it be by inspiration?
How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood.
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine.
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
O, for my beads!
I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land.
O spite of spites!
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not?
Dromio thou, Dromio thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
I am transformèd, master, am I not?
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
Thou hast thine own form.
No, I am an ape.
If thou art changed to aught, ’tis to an ass.
'Tis true.
She rides me, and I long for grass.
'Tis so.
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking, mad or well advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I’ll say as they say, and persever so, And in this mist at all adventures go.
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
I think thou art an ass.
Marry, so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
You’re sad, Signior Balthasar.
Pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
O Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words.
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part.
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But soft!
My door is lock’d.
Go, bid them let us in.
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
Mome, malt horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!
Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch.
What patch is made our porter?
My master stays in the street.
Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on ’s feet.
Who talks within there?
Ho, open the door.
Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you tell me wherefore.
Wherefore?
For my dinner.
I have not dined today.
Nor today here you must not.
Come again when you may.
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name!
What a coil is there, Dromio!
Who are those at the gate?
Let my master in, Luce.
Faith, no, he comes too late, And so tell your master.
O Lord, I must laugh.
Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?
Have at you with another: that’s When, can you tell?
If thy name be called “Luce,” Luce, thou hast answered him well.
Do you hear, you minion?
You’ll let us in, I hope?
I thought to have asked you.
And you said no.
So, come, help.
Well struck!
Thou baggage, let me in.
[within)   Can you tell for whose sake?
Master, knock the door hard.
Let him knock till it ache.
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?
By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.
Are you there, wife?
You might have come before.
Your wife, sir knave?
Go, get you from the door.
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome.
We would fain have either.
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
They stand at the door, master.
Bid them welcome hither.
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
Go, fetch me something: I’ll break ope the gate.
Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate.
It seems thou want’st breaking.
Out upon thee, hind!
Here’s too much “out upon thee!
” I pray thee, let me in.
Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
Well, I’ll break in.
Go, borrow me a crow.
A crow without feather?
Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together.
Go, get thee gone.
Fetch me an iron crow.
Have patience, sir.
O, let it not be so.
Herein you war against your reputation, And draw within the compass of suspect Th' unviolated honor of your wife.
You have prevailed.
I will depart in quiet And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse, Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.
There will we dine.
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Do so.
This jest shall cost me some expense.
And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband’s office?
Shall, Antipholus, Even in the spring of love thy love springs rot?
Sweet mistress what your name is else I know not, Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,  Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.
Lay open to my earthy gross conceit, Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak, The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
What, are you mad that you do reason so?
Not mad, but mated how, I do not know.
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
Why call you me “love”?
Call my sister so.
Thy sister’s sister.
That’s my sister.
All this my sister is, or else should be.
Call thyself “sister,” sweet, for I am thee.
O soft, sir!
Hold you still.
I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.
Why, how now, Dromio.
Where runn’st thou so fast?
Do you know me, sir?
Am I Dromio?
Am I your man?
Am I myself?
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself.
What woman’s man?
And how besides thyself?
Marry, sir, besides myself I am due to a woman, one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
What claim lays she to thee?
What is she?
A very reverent body, ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say “sir reverence.
” I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
How dost thou mean a “fat marriage”?
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
What complexion is she of?
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.
For why?
She sweats a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.
That’s a fault that water will mend.
What’s her name?
Then she bears some breadth?
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip.
She is spherical, like a globe.
I could find out countries in her.
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
Marry, sir, in her buttocks.
I found it out by the bogs.
Where Scotland?
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
Where France?
In her forehead, armed and reverted, making war against her heir.
Where England?
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them.
But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
Where Spain?
Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath.
Where America, the Indies?
O, sir, upon her nose, all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
O, sir, I did not look so low.
To conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, call’d me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch.
Go, hie thee presently.
Post to the road.
An if the wind blow any way from shore, I will not harbor in this town tonight.
As from a bear a man would run for life, So fly I from her that would be my wife.
There’s none but witches do inhabit here, And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soul Doth for a wife abhor.
But her fair sister, Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace, Of such enchanting presence and discourse, Hath almost made me traitor to myself.
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong, I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.
Master Antipholus.
Ay, that’s my name.
I know it well, sir.
Lo, here’s the chain.
What is your will that I shall do with this?
What please yourself, sir.
I have made it for you.
Made it for me, sir?
I bespoke it not.
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it and please your wife withal, And soon at supper time I’ll visit you And then receive my money for the chain.
I pray you, sir, receive the money now, For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
You are a merry man, sir.
Fare you well.
What I should think of this I cannot tell, But this I think: there’s no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.
If any ship put out, then straight away.
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus.
And in the instant that I met with you, He had of me a chain.
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
That labor may you save.
See where he comes.
While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou And buy a rope’s end.
That will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day.
But soft.
I see the goldsmith.
Get thee gone.
Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
I buy a thousand pound a year!
I buy a rope!
A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
I promisèd your presence and the chain, But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long If it were chained together, and therefore came not.
Saving your merry humor, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
I am not furnished with the present money.
Besides, I have some business in the town.
Good signior, take the stranger to my house, And with you take the chain, and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself.
No, bear it with you lest I come not time enough.
Well, sir, I will.
Have you the chain about you?
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have, Or else you may return without your money.
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
Good Lord!
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
The hour steals on.
I pray you, sir, dispatch.
You hear how he importunes me.
The chain!
Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
Come, come.
You know I gave it you even now.
Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.
Come, where’s the chain?
I pray you, let me see it.
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir, say whe'er you’ll answer me or no.
If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer.
I answer you?
What should I answer you?
The money that you owe me for the chain.
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
You gave me none.
You wrong me much to say so.
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
I do,  and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me.
This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me, Or I attach you by this officer.
Consent to pay thee that I never had?
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
Here is thy fee.
Arrest him, officer.
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.
I do arrest you, sir.
You hear the suit.
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer.
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum That stays but till her owner comes aboard, And then, sir, she bears away.
Our fraughtage, sir, I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought The oil, the balsamum and aqua vitae.
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind Blows fair from land.
They stay for naught at all But for their owner, master, and yourself.
How now?
A madman?
Why, thou peevish sheep, What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end.
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight.
Give her this key, and tell her in the desk That’s cover’d o'er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats.
Let her send it.
Tell her I am arrested in the street, And that shall bail me.
Hie thee, slave.
Begone.
On, officer, to prison till it come.
To Adriana.
That is where we dined, Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation mad’st thou in this case Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?
First he denied you had in him no right.
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
Then pleaded I for you.
And what said he?
That love i begged for you he begged of me.
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
Did’st speak him fair?
Have patience, I beseech.
Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.
Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Here, go the desk, the purse!
Sweet, now make haste.
How hast thou lost thy breath?
By running fast.
Where is thy master, Dromio?
Is he well?
No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
Why, man, what is the matter?
I do not know the matter.
He is ’rested on the case.
What, is he arrested?
Tell me at whose suit.
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well, But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I tell.
Will you send him, mistress, redemption the money in his desk?
Go fetch it, sister.
Not on a bond, but on a stronger thing: A chain, a chain.
Do you not hear it ring?
What, the chain?
No, no, the bell.
'Tis time that I were gone.
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
The hours come back.
That did I never hear.
O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back for very fear.
As if time were in debt.
How fondly dost thou reason!
Time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he’s worth to season.
Nay, he’s a thief too.
Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day?
If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
Go, Dromio.
There’s the money.
Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit: Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
Master, here’s The gold you sent me for.
What, have you got redemption of the picture of old Adam new appareled?
What gold is this?
What Adam dost thou mean?
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
I understand thee not.
No?
What, thou meanest an officer?
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery.
Is there any ships put forth tonight?
May we be gone?
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight, and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay .
The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions.
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
Is that the chain you promised me today?
Satan, avoid!
I charge thee, tempt me not.
Master, is this Mistress Satan?
It is the devil.
Nay, she is worse; she is the devil’s dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench.
And thereof comes that the wenches say “God damn me” that’s as much to say “God make me a light wench.
” It is written they appear to men like angels of light.
Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn.
Come not near her.
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.
Will you go with me?
We’ll mend our dinner here.
Why, Dromio?
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil.
Avoid then, fiend!
What tell’st thou me of supping?
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress.
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised, And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Some devils ask but the parings of one’s nail, a rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, a cherrystone; but she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise.
An if you give it her, the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain.
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
Avaunt, thou witch!
Come, Dromio, let us go.
“Fly pride,” says the peacock.
Fear me not, man.
I will not break away: I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money, To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood today And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attached in Ephesus.
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
But where’s the money?
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I returned.
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

Good sir, be patient.
Nay, ’tis for me to be patient.
I am in adversity.
Good now, hold thy tongue.
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
Thou whoreson, senseless villain.
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.
Come, go along.
My wife is coming yonder.
Wilt thou still talk?
How say you now?
Is not your husband mad?
His incivility confirms no less.
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man, To yield possession to my holy prayers And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
Peace, doting wizard, peace.
I am not mad.
O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house?
O husband, God doth know you dined at home, Where would you had remained until this time, Free from these slanders and this open shame.
“Dined at home”?
Thou villain, what sayest thou?
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?
Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.
And did not she herself revile me there?
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you.
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
In verity you did.
My bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries?
It is no shame.
The fellow finds his vein And, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy.
Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
Money by me!
Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
He came to me, and I delivered it.
And I am witness with her that she did.
God and the rope maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope.
Mistress, both man and master is possessed.
I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today.
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
And, gentle master, I received no gold.
But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.
Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all, And art confederate with a damnèd pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me.
But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport.
O bind him, bind him!
Let him not come near me.
More company!
The fiend is strong within him.
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
What, will you murder me?
Thou jailer, thou, I am thy prisoner.
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue?
Masters, let him go.
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
He is my prisoner.
If I let him go, The debt he owes will be required of me.
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed Home to my house.
O most unhappy day!
O most unhappy strumpet!
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
Out on thee, villain!
Wherefore dost thou mad me?
Will you be bound for nothing?
Be mad, good master.
Cry “The devil!
God help poor souls!
How idly do they talk!
Go bear him hence.
Sister, go you with me.
A man named Angelo, a goldsmith.
Do you know him?
I know the man.
Two hundred ducats.
What does he owe it for?
It's for a chain your husband bought from him.
That may be true, but I never saw it.
God for Thy mercy, they are loose again!
And come with naked swords.
Let’s call more help To have them bound again.
Away!
They’ll kill us.
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
She that would be your wife now ran from you.
Come to the Centaur.
Fetch our stuff from thence.
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
Faith, stay here this night.
They will surely do us no harm.
You saw they speak us fair, give us gold.
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, i could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch.
I will not stay tonight for all the town.
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you, But I protest he had the chain of me, Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
Speak softly.
Yonder, as I think, he walks.
I think I had.
I never did deny it.
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch.
'Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.
I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake.
He is mad.
Some get within him; take his sword away.
Bind dromio too, and bear them to my house!
Run, master, run.
For God’s sake, take a house.
This is some priory.
In, or we are spoiled.
Be quiet, people.
Wherefore throng you hither?
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery.
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
How long hath this possession held the man?
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was.
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?
Buried some dear friend?
You should for that have reprehended him.
Why, so I did.
Ay, but not rough enough.
As roughly as my modesty would let me.
Haply in private.
And in assemblies too.
Ay, but not enough.
It was the copy of our conference.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder’d by thy railing, And therefore comes it that his head is light.
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings.
Unquiet meals make ill digestions.
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.
She never reprehended him but mildly When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and wildly.
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people, enter and lay hold on him.
No, not a creature enters in my house.
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
I will attend my husband, be his nurse, Diet his sickness, for it is my office And will have no attorney but myself; And therefore let me have him home with me.
Be patient, for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approvd means I have, With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers, To make of him a formal man again.
Be quiet and depart.
Thou shalt not have him.
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
Come, go.
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
By this, I think, the dial points at five.
Upon what cause?
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town, Beheaded publicly for his offense.
See where they come.
We will behold his death.
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him, He shall not die; so much we tender him.
Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself.
Peace, fool.
Thy master and his man are here, And that is false thou dost report to us.
Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
Come, stand by me.
Fear nothing.
Guard with halberds.
Ay me, it is my husband.
Witness you That he is borne about invisible.
Even now we housed him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house.
A grievous fault.
Say, woman, didst thou so?
No, my good lord.
Myself, he, and my sister Today did dine together.
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal.
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth.
O perjured woman!
They are both forsworn.
In this the madman justly chargeth them.
My liege, I am advisèd what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady rash, provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman locked me out this day from dinner.
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him: That he dined not at home, but was locked out.
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
He had, my lord, and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck.
I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven, And this is false you burden me withal.
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been.
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here Denies that saying.
Sirrah, what say you?
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?
As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
Why, this is strange.
Go call the Abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word.
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me.
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman Dromio?
Within this hour I was his bondman sir, But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords.
Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.
I am sure you both of you remember me.
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you.
For lately we were bound as you are now.
You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?
Why look you strange on me?
you know me well.
I never saw you in my life till now.
Neither.
Dromio, nor thou?
No, trust me, sir, nor I.
I am sure thou dost.
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
Not know my voice!
O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.
All these old witnesses I cannot err  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
I never saw my father in my life.
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know’st we parted.
But perhaps, my son, Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus, During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa.
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged.
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
One of these men is genius to the other.
And so, of these, which is the natural man And which the spirit?
Who deciphers them?
I, sir, am Dromio.
Command him away.
I, sir, am Dromio.
Please, let me stay.
Egeon art thou not, or else his ghost?
O, my old master.
Who hath bound him here?
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia, That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak, And speak unto the same Emilia.
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.
If thou art she, tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first.
No, sir, not I.   I came from Syracuse.
Stay, stand apart.
I know not which is which.
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
And I with him.
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon, your most renownèd uncle.
Which of you two did dine with me today?
I, gentle mistress.
And are not you my husband?
No, I say nay to that.
And so do I, yet did she call me so, And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, Did call me brother.
What I told you then I hope I shall have leisure to make good, If this be not a dream I see and hear.
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
I think it be, sir.
I deny it not.
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
I think I did, sir.
I deny it not.
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
No, none by me.
This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me.
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
It shall not need.
Thy father hath his life.
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
He speaks to me.
I am your master, Dromio.
Come, go with us.
We’ll look to that anon.
Embrace thy brother there.
Rejoice with him.
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner.
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
Not I, sir.
You are my elder.
That’s a question.
How shall we try it?
We’ll draw cuts for the signior.
Till then, lead thou first.
Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn.
And such a want wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself.
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad.
I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads.
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad.
My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hourglass run, But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial.
Believe me, no.
I thank my fortune for it   My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place, nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year.
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
Why then, you are in love.
Fie, fie!
Not in love neither?
I would have stayed till I had made you merry If worthier friends had not prevented me.
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
Good morrow, my good lords.
We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you.
But at dinnertime I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
I will not fail you.
You look not well, Signor Antonio.
You have too much respect upon the world.
They lose it that do buy it with much care.
Believe me, you are marvelously changed.
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano   A stage where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one.
Let me play the fool.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,
Well, we will leave you then till dinnertime.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.
Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
Farewell.
I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
Is that any thing now?
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.
Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promised to tell me of?
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.
And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honor, be assured My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions.
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance.
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have.
In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair and  fairer than that word   Of wondrous virtues.
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages.
Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea.
Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum.
Therefore go forth, Try what my credit can in Venice do   That shall be racked even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are.
And yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing.
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean.
Good sentences, and well pronounced.
They would be better if well followed.
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations.
Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love.
But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
I pray thee, overname them.
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
Then there is the County Palatine.
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “An you will not have me, choose.
” He hears merry tales and smiles not.
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.
I had rather be married to a death’s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these.
God defend me from these two!
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!
why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him.
He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show?
How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able.
I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.
When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast.
And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him.
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords.
They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will.
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence.
And I pray God grant them a fair departure.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio  as I think he was so called.
True, madam.
He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave.
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa.
Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer Another knocks at the door.
Three thousand ducats, well.
Ay, sir, for three months.
For three months, well.
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
Antonio shall become bound, well.
May you stead me?
Will you pleasure me?
Shall I know your answer?
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
Your answer to that?
Antonio is a good man.
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
Ho, no, no, no, no.
My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient.
Yet his means are in supposition.
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies.
Be assured you may.
I will be assured I may, and that I may be assured, I will bethink me.
May I speak with Antonio?
If it please you to dine with us.
Yes  to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into.
I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.
What news on the Rialto?
Who is he comes here?
This is Signor Antonio.
Shylock, do you hear?
I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats.
What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me.
But soft!
How many months Do you desire?
Rest you fair, good signor.
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom.
Is he yet possessed How much ye would?
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
And for three months.
I had forgot  three months.
You told me so.
Well then, your bond, and let me see  But hear you, Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage.
I do never use it.
And what of him?
Did he take interest?
I cannot tell: I make it breed as fast.
But note me, signor
Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
Oh, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
Three thousand ducats  ’tis a good round sum.
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances.
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
I am as like to call thee so again, To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.
Why, look you how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stained me with, Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys  and you’ll not hear me!
This is kind I offer.
This were kindness.
This kindness will I show.
Content, in faith.
I’ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me!
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
Why, fear not, man.
I will not forfeit it.
Within these two months  that’s a month before This bond expires  I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.
Come on.
In this there can be no dismay.
Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnished sun, To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.
In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes.
Besides, the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
Even for that I thank you.
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune.
Nor will not.
Come, bring me unto my chance.
First, forward to the temple.
After dinner Your hazard shall be made.
Good fortune then!
To make me blessed or cursed’st among men.
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,” “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or “Good Launcelot Gobbo”   “use your legs, take the start, run away.
” My conscience says, “No.
Take heed, honest Launcelot.
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all on your left.
Marry, at the very next turning turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.
By God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Mark me now.
Now will I raise the waters.
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
No “master,” sir, but a poor man’s son.
His father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live.
Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelot.
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot, sir.
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Of Launcelot, an ’t please your mastership.
Ergo, Master Launcelot.
Marry, God forbid!
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel post, a staff or a prop?
Do you know me, Father?
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.
But I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?
Do you not know me, Father?
Alack, sir, I am sand blind.
I know you not.
Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me.
It is a wise father that knows his own child.
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.
Give me your blessing.
Truth will come to light.
Pray you, sir, stand up.
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.
I cannot think you are my son.
I know not what I shall think of that.
But I am Launcelot, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
Her name is Margery, indeed.
I’ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast thou got!
Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill horse has on his tail.
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.
Lord, how art thou changed!
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I have brought him a present.
How 'gree you now?
You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.
See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
To him, Father.
God bless your worship!
Gramercy!
Wouldst thou aught with me?
Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man that would, sir, as my father shall specify
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to
Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew and have a desire, as my father shall specify
His master and he, saving your worship’s reverence, are scarce cater cousins
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man  and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father
One speak for both.
What would you?
Serve you, sir.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
I know thee well.
Thou hast obtained thy suit.
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, And hath preferred thee, if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew’s service, to become The follower of so poor a gentleman.
Thou speak’st it well.
Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master and inquire My lodging out.
Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows'.
See it done.
Father, in.
I cannot get a service, no.
I have ne'er a tongue in my head.
Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune.
Go to, here’s a simple line of life.
Here’s a small trifle of wives.
Alas, fifteen wives is nothing!
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
These things being bought and orderly bestowed, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteemed acquaintance.
Hie thee, go.
My best endeavours shall be done herein.
Where is your master?
Yonder, sir, he walks.
Signor Bassanio!
Gratiano!
I have a suit to you.
You have obtained it.
You must not deny me.
I must go with you to Belmont.
Why, then you must.
But hear thee, Gratiano.
Signor Bassanio, hear me.
Well, we shall see your bearing.
Nay, but I bar tonight.
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest.
But we will visit you at supper time.
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee.
Adieu!
Tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
But adieu.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
Adieu.
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Nay, we will slink away in supper time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return, All in an hour.
We have not made good preparation.
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered, And better in my mind not undertook.
'Tis now but four o'clock.
We have two hours To furnish us.
An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.
I know the hand.
In faith, ’tis a fair hand, And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ.
Love news, in faith?
By your leave, sir.
Whither goest thou?
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.
Hold here, take this.
Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her.
Speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen, Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
I am provided of a torchbearer.
Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.
And so will I.
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.
'Tis good we do so.
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
I must needs tell thee all.
She hath directed How I shall take her from her father’s house, What gold and jewels she is furnished with, What page’s suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake.
And never dare Misfortune cross her foot Unless she do it under this excuse: That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me.
Peruse this as thou goest.
Why, Jessica!
Who bids thee call?
I do not bid thee call.
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.
Call you?
What is your will?
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.
There are my keys.
But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love.
They flatter me.
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.
Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.
I am right loath to go.
There is some ill a brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money bags tonight.
I beseech you, sir, go.
My young master doth expect your reproach.
So do I his.
And they have conspired together.
I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th' afternoon.
What, are there masques?
Hear you me, Jessica.
Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry necked fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces.
But stop my house’s ears  I mean my casements   Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house.
By Jacob’s staff, I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.
But I will go.
Go you before me, sirrah.
Say I will come.
I will go before, sir.
Mistress, look out at window, for all this.
There will come a Christian by Will be worth a Jewess' eye.
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?
His words were, “Farewell, mistress.
” Nothing else.
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.
His hour is almost past.
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont
That ever holds.
Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Here comes Lorenzo.
More of this hereafter.
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I’ll watch as long for you then.
Approach.
Who are you?
Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.
Lorenzo, and thy love.
Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed   For who love I so much?
And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
Here, catch this casket.
It is worth the pains.
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew.
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.
And true she is, as she hath proved herself.
And therefore, like herself  wise, fair and true   Shall she be placèd in my constant soul.
Who’s there?
Signor Antonio?
Fie, fie, Gratiano!
Where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock.
Our friends all stay for you.
No masque tonight.
I am glad on ’t.
[to servant[ Go draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.
” The second, silver, which this promise carries: “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
” This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt: “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
” How shall I know if I do choose the right?
The one of them contains my picture, Prince.
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
Some god direct my judgment!
Let me see.
I will survey th' inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
” Must give  for what?
For lead?
Hazard for lead?
This casket threatens .
Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages.
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
” “As much as he deserves!
”  pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand.
There, take it, Prince.
And if my form lie there Then I am yours.
O hell, what have we here?
A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll.
I’ll read the writing.
“All that glisters is not gold   Often have you heard that told.
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold.
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
A gentle riddance.
Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail.
With him is Gratiano gone along.
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
He came too late.
The ship was under sail.
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
I never heard a passion so confused, So strange, outrageous, and so variable, As the dog Jew did utter in the streets .
“My daughter!
O my ducats!
O my daughter, Fled with a Christian!
O my Christian ducats!
Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter!
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!
Marry, well remembered.
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught.
I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wished in silence that it were not his.
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return.
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other.
Do we so.
Quick, quick, I pray thee.
Draw the curtain straight.
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
If you choose that wherein I am contained, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
And so have I addressed me.
Fortune now To my heart’s hope!
Gold, silver, and base lead.
Too long a pause for that which you find there.
What’s here?
The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule!
I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”!
Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
Is that my prize?
Are my deserts no better?
To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposèd natures.
What is here?
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
O these deliberate fools!
When they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
The ancient saying is no heresy.
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Here.
What would my lord?
No more, I pray thee.
Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!
Now, what news on the Rialto?
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas.
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio  oh, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!
Come, the full stop.
Ha, what sayest thou?
Why, the end is he hath lost a ship.
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
You knew  none so well, none so well as you  of my daughter’s flight.
That’s certain.
I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged, and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
She is damned for it.
That’s certain  if the devil may be her judge.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
Out upon it, old carrion!
Rebels it at these years?
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish.
But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
There I have another bad match!
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh.
What’s that good for?
To bait fish withal.
If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge.
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both.
We have been up and down to seek him.
Here comes another of the tribe.
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.
How now, Tubal?
What news from Genoa?
Hast thou found my daughter?
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
Why, there, there, there, there!
A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt  the curse never fell upon our nation till now!
I never felt it till now  Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin!
Yes, other men have ill luck too.
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa
What, what, what?
Ill luck, ill luck?
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
I thank God, I thank God!
Is ’t true, is ’t true?
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.
I thank thee, good Tubal.
Good news, good news!
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night fourscore ducats.
Thou stickest a dagger in me.
I shall never see my gold again.
Fourscore ducats at a sitting!
Fourscore ducats!
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
I am very glad of it.
I’ll plague him.
I’ll torture him.
I am glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
Out upon her!
Thou torturest me, Tubal.
It was my turquoise.
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
But Antonio is certainly undone.
Nay, that’s true, that’s very true.
Go, Tubal, fee me an officer.
Bespeak him a fortnight before.
I pray you, tarry.
Pause a day or two Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong I lose your company.
Therefore forbear awhile.
Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack.
Upon the rack, Bassanio?
Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love.
None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love.
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforcèd do speak anything.
Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.
Well then, confess and live.
“Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession.
O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
Away, then.
I am locked in one of them.
If you do love me you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice.
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end, Fading in music.
That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And watery deathbed for him.
He may win, And what is music then?
Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new crownèd monarch.
Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear And summon him to marriage.
Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides, when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea monster.
Reply, reply.
Ding, dong, bell.
So may the outward shows be least themselves.
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But, being seasoned with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil?
In religion, What damnèd error, but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash embraced despair, And shuddering fear, and green eyed jealousy!
O love, be moderate.
What find I here?
Fair Portia’s counterfeit!
What demigod Hath come so near creation?
Move these eyes?
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand Such as I am.
My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish, For I am sure you can wish none from me.
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours.
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.
You loved, I loved.
For intermission No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the casket there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls.
Is this true, Nerissa?
Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
Yes, faith, my lord.
Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.
We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
What, and stake down?
No, we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down.
But who comes here?
Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome.
By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome.
So do I, my lord.
I thank your honor.
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger.
Bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio.
What’s the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success.
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.
O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper.
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it.
Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man.
He plies the duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice.
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him.
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
What sum owes he the Jew?
For me, three thousand ducats.
What, no more?
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond!
Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend.
For never shall you lie by Portia’s side With an unquiet soul.
You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows.
Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer.
“Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried.
My creditors grow cruel.
My estate is very low.
My bond to the Jew is forfeit.
And since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death.
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.
O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste.
Jailer, look to him.
Tell not me of mercy.
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Jailer, look to him.
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
I’ll have my bond.
Speak not against my bond.
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou calledst me dog before thou hadst a cause.
But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.
The duke shall grant me justice.
I do wonder, Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request.
I pray thee, hear me speak.
I’ll have my bond.
I will not hear thee speak.
I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
I’ll not be made a soft and dull eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.
Follow not.
I’ll have no speaking.
I will have my bond.
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.
Let him alone.
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life.
His reason well I know.
I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me.
Therefore he hates me.
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
The duke cannot deny the course of law.
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased To wish it back on you.
Fare you well, Jessica.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you yet know not of.
We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.
Shall they see us?
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplishèd With that we lack.
Why, shall we turn to men?
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children.
Therefore I promise ye I fear you.
I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.
Therefore be o' good cheer, for truly I think you are damned.
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed.
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother.
I shall be saved by my husband.
He hath made me a Christian.
Truly, the more to blame he.
We were Christians eno' before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs.
If we grow all to be pork eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
I’ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say.
Here he comes.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.
Launcelot and I are out.
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly.
The Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason.
But if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
How every fool can play upon the word!
That is done, sir.
They have all stomachs.
Goodly Lord, what a wit snapper are you!
Then bid them prepare dinner.
That is done too, sir.
Only “Cover!
Will you cover then, sir?
Not so, sir, neither.
I know my duty.
Yet more quarreling with occasion!
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
I pray thee, understand a plain man in his plain meaning.
Go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
For the table, sir, it shall be served in.
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
Past all expressing.
It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, For having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth.
And if on earth he do not merit it, In reason he should never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!
I will anon.
First let us go to dinner.
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.
Then howsome'er thou speak’st ’mong other things I shall digest it.
Well, I’ll set you forth.
What, is Antonio here?
Ready, so please your grace.
I am sorry for thee.
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course.
Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.
He is ready at the door.
He comes, my lord.
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats.
I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour.
Is it answered?
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned?
What, are you answered yet?
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Every offense is not a hate at first.
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
I pray you, think you question with the Jew?
You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height.
You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb.
You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven.
You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that  than which what’s harder?
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.
My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua.
Bring us the letter.
Good cheer, Antonio!
What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death.
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your grace.
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou makest thy knife keen.
But no metal can   No, not the hangman’s axe  bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin.
I stand here for law.
This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learnèd doctor to our court.
Where is he?
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.
With all my heart.
Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
“Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome.
His name is Balthazar.
I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant.
We turned o'er many books together.
He is furnished with my opinion, which  bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend  comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead.
I did, my lord.
You are welcome.
Take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court?
I am informèd thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
Is your name Shylock?
Shylock is my name.
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?
Ay, so he says.
Do you confess the bond?
I do.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
On what compulsion must I?
Tell me that.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath.
It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown.
My deeds upon my head.
Is he not able to discharge the money?
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court   Yea, twice the sum.
If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.
If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth.
It must not be.
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd.
'Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state.
It cannot be.
A Daniel come to judgment, yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
Why, this bond is forfeit!
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart.
Be merciful.
Take thrice thy money.
Bid me tear the bond.
When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge.
You know the law.
Your exposition Hath been most sound.
I charge you by the law, Whereof you are a well deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment.
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me.
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.
Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
O noble judge!
O excellent young man!
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
'Tis very true.
O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
Ay, his breast.
So says the bond.
Doth it not, noble judge?
“Nearest his heart”  those are the very words.
It is so.
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh?
I have them ready.
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
It is not so expressed, but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
I cannot find it.
'Tis not in the bond.
You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
But little.
I am armed and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio.
Fare you well.
Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself.
But life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life.
I would lose all  ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil  to deliver you.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer.
I have a wife, whom I protest I love.
I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
'Tis well you offer it behind her back.
The wish would make else an unquiet house.
These be the Christian husbands.
A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine.
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
Most rightful judge!
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Most learnèd judge, a sentence!
Come, prepare.
Tarry a little.
There is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.
The words expressly are “a pound of flesh.
” Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice.
O upright judge!
Mark, Jew.
O learnèd judge!
Is that the law?
Thyself shalt see the act.
For as thou urgest justice, be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.
O learnèd judge!
Mark, Jew, a learnèd judge!
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.
Here is the money.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice.
Soft, no haste.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
O Jew!
An upright judge, a learnèd judge!
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh.
A second Daniel!
A Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
Why doth the Jew pause?
Take thy forfeiture.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
I have it ready for thee.
Here it is.
He hath refused it in the open court.
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
Shall I not have barely my principal?
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
Why then, the devil give him good of it!
I’ll stay no longer question.
Tarry, Jew.
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods.
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s.
The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
Nay, take my life and all.
Pardon not that.
You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house.
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live.
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake.
He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronouncèd here.
Art thou contented, Jew?
What dost thou say?
I am content.
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.
I am not well.
Send the deed after me, And I will sign it.
Get thee gone, but do it.
In christening shalt thou have two godfathers.
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more   To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon.
I must away this night toward Padua, And it is meet I presently set forth.
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For in my mind you are much bound to him.
And stand indebted, over and above, In love and service to you evermore.
He is well paid that is well satisfied.
And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid.
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again.
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as a fee.
Grant me two things, I pray you: Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
You press me far and therefore I will yield.
Give me your gloves.
I’ll wear them for your sake.
And for your love, I’ll take this ring from you.
Do not draw back your hand.
I’ll take no more, And you in love shall not deny me this.
This ring, good sir  alas, it is a trifle.
I will not shame myself to give you this.
I will have nothing else but only this.
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
There’s more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation.
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered.
That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a madwoman, And know how well I have deserved the ring, She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me.
Well, peace be with you.
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued against your wife’s commandment.
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.
Give him the ring and bring him, if thou canst, Unto Antonio’s house.
Away, make haste.
Inquire the Jew’s house out.
Give him this deed, And let him sign it.
We’ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner.
That will I do.
Sir, I would speak with you.
I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
Thou mayst, I warrant.
We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men.
But we’ll outface them, and outswear them too.
Away, make haste.
Thou know’st where I will tarry.
Come, good sir.
Will you show me to this house?
The moon shines bright.
In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise, in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night.
In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself And ran dismayed away.
In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage.
In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson.
In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont.
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well, Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne'er a true one.
In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
A friend.
A friend?
What friend?
Your name, I pray you, friend?
Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day
Who comes with her?
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet returned?
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Sola, sola!
Wo, ha, ho!
Sola, sola!
Who calls?
Sola!
Did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
Leave holloaing, man.
Here.
Sola!
Where, where?
Here.
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news.
My master will be here ere morning.
Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter.
Why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand.
And bring your music forth into the air.
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
The reason is your spirits are attentive.
That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
So doth the greater glory dim the less.
It is your music, madam, of the house.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended, and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace!
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.
That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo   By the bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they returned?
Madam, they are not yet, But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming.
Go in, Nerissa.
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.
Nor you, Lorenzo.
Jessica, nor you.
Your husband is at hand.
I hear his trumpet.
We are no tell tales, madam.
Fear you not.
Let me give light, but let me not be light.
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me.
I thank you, madam.
Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.
No more than I am well acquitted of.
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong.
In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.
A quarrel, ho, already?
What’s the matter?
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, “Love me and leave me not.
What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave.
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge’s clerk!
He will, an if he live to be a man.
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbèd boy No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk, A prating boy that begged it as a fee.
I could not for my heart deny it him.
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it.
And here he stands.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.
An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too.
And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begged mine.
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.
What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ring.
Nor I in yours Till I again see mine.
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house!
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you.
I’ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
Lie not a night from home.
Watch me like Argus.
And I his clerk.
Therefore be well advised How you do leave me to mine own protection.
Well, do you so, let not me take him then.
For if I do I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Sir, grieve not you.
You are welcome notwithstanding.
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself   In each eye, one.
Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit!
Nay, but hear me.
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.
Then you shall be his surety.
Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other.
Here, Lord Bassanio.
Swear to keep this ring.
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
I had it of him.
Pardon me, Bassanio, For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, For that same scrubbèd boy, the doctor’s clerk, In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer where the ways are fair enough!
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
Speak not so grossly.
You are all amazed.
Here is a letter.
Read it at your leisure.
It comes from Padua, from Bellario.
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa there her clerk.
Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you, And even but now returned.
I have not yet Entered my house.
Antonio, you are welcome.
And I have better news in store for you Than you expect.
I am dumb.
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man.
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
When I am absent then lie with my wife.
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living.
For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road.
How now, Lorenzo?
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starvèd people.
It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full.
Let us go in, And charge us there upon interr'gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.
Let it be so.
The first interrogatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
But were the day come, I should wish it dark, That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.
Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.
All his successors gone before him hath done't; and all his ancestors that come after him may: they may give the dozen white luces in their coat.
It is an old coat.
The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.
You may, by marrying.
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
Not a whit.
The council shall bear it; it is a riot.
Ha!
o' my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.
Mistress Anne Page?
She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.
Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.
Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.
Well, let us see honest Master Page.
Is Falstaff there?
Shall I tell you a lie?
I do despise a liar as I do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that is not true.
The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I beseech you, be ruled by your well willers.
I will peat the door for Master Page.
What, hoa!
Got pless your house here!
Who's there?
Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another tale, if matters grow to your likings.
I am glad to see your worships well.
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.
Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it your good heart!
I wished your venison better; it was ill killed.
How doth good Mistress Page?
and I thank you always with my heart, la!
Sir, I thank you.
Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
How does your fallow greyhound, sir?
I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.
It could not be judged, sir.
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
That he will not.
'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault; 'tis a good dog.
A cur, sir.
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be more said?
he is good and fair.
Is Sir John Falstaff here?
Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you.
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
He hath wronged me, Master Page.
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that so, Master Page?
Here comes Sir John.
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?
Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and broke open my lodge.
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?
Tut, a pin!
this shall be answered.
I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
That is now answered.
The council shall know this.
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: you'll be laughed at.
Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
Good worts!
Good cabbage.
Slender, I broke your head: what matter have you against me?
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you; and against your cony catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol.
You Banbury cheese!
Ay, it is no matter.
How now, Mephostophilus!
Ay, it is no matter.
Slice, I say!
pauca, pauca: slice!
that's my humour.
Where's Simple, my man?
Can you tell, cousin?
Peace, I pray you.
Now let us understand.
Pistol!
He hears with ears.
The tevil and his tam!
what phrase is this, 'He hears with ear'?
why, it is affectations.
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
Is this true, Pistol?
No; it is false, if it is a pick purse.
Ha, thou mountain foreigner!
Sir John and Master mine, I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
What say you, Scarlet and John?
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
O heaven!
this is Mistress Anne Page.
How now, Mistress Ford!
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met: by your leave, good mistress.
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome.
Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.
I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.
How now, Simple!
where have you been?
I must wait on myself, must I?
You have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?
Book of Riddles!
why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon All hallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?
Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you.
Nay, but understand me.
So I do, sir.
But that is not the question: the question is concerning your marriage.
Ay, there's the point, sir.
Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.
Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.
But can you affection the 'oman?
Let us command to know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth.
Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.
Nay, Got's lords and his ladies!
you must speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her.
That you must.
Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do is to pleasure you, coz.
Can you love the maid?
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
The dinner is on the table; my father desires your worships' company.
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
Od's plessed will!
I will not be absence at the grace.
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
The dinner attends you, sir.
I am not a hungry, I thank you, forsooth.
Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his friend for a man.
I pray you, sir, walk in.
I had rather walk here, I thank you.
I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England.
You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?
Ay, indeed, sir.
That's meat and drink to me, now.
Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir!
come, come.
Nay, pray you, lead the way.
Come on, sir.
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
Well, sir.
Nay, it is petter yet.
Mine host of the Garter!
What says my bully rook?
speak scholarly and wisely.
Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.
Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.
I sit at ten pounds a week.
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar.
Do so, good mine host.
I have spoke; let him follow.
Bardolph, follow him.
It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.
O base Hungarian wight!
wilt thou the spigot wield?
He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
'Convey,' the wise it call.
'Steal!  '
foh!
a fico for the phrase!
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
Why, then, let kibes ensue.
There is no remedy; I must cony catch; I must shift.
Young ravens must have food.
Which of you know Ford of this town?
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
Two yards, and more.
No quips now, Pistol!
Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about thrift.
He hath studied her will, and translated her will, out of honesty into English.
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
I thank thee for that humour.
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning glass!
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become, And by my side wear steel?
then, Lucifer take all!
Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly; Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
Let vultures gripe thy guts!
I have operations which be humours of revenge.
Wilt thou revenge?
By welkin and her star!
With wit or steel?
And I to Ford shall eke unfold How Falstaff, varlet vile, His dove will prove, his gold will hold, And his soft couch defile.
Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.
What, John Rugby!
I pray thee, go to the casement, and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming.
If he do, i' faith, and find any body in the house, here will be an old abusing of God's patience and the king's English.
I'll go watch.
Ay, for fault of a better.
And Master Slender's your master?
Ay, forsooth.
No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow beard, a Cain coloured beard.
A softly sprighted man, is he not?
How say you?
Yes, indeed, does he.
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!
Out, alas!
here comes my master.
We shall all be shent.
What, John Rugby!
John!
what, John, I say!
Vat is you sing?
I do not like des toys.
Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.
Fe, fe, fe, fe!
ma foi, il fait fort chaud.
Je m'en vais a la cour  la grande affaire.
Is it this, sir?
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly.
Vere is dat knave Rugby?
What, John Rugby!
John!
Here, sir!
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.
Come, take a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
By my trot, I tarry too long.
Od's me!
Qu'ai j'oublie!
dere is some simples in my closet, dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.
Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!
O diable, diable!
vat is in my closet?
Villain!
larron!
Rugby, my rapier!
Good master, be content.
Wherefore shall I be content a?
The young man is an honest man.
What shall de honest man do in my closet?
dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic.
Vell.
Ay, forsooth; to desire her to
Peace, I pray you.
Peace a your tongue.
Speak a your tale.
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage.
This is all, indeed, la!
Sir Hugh send a you?
Rugby, baille me some paper.
Tarry you a little a while.
'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.
Are you avised o' that?
you shall find it a great charge: and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding,   to tell you in your ear; I would have no words of it,  my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,  that's neither here nor there.
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well.
We must give folks leave to prate: what, the goodyear!
Rugby, come to the court with me.
By gar, if I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.
Follow my heels, Rugby.
You shall have An fool's head of your own.
Who's within there?
ho!
Who's there, I trow!
Come near the house, I pray you.
How now, good woman?
how dost thou?
The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.
What news?
how does pretty Mistress Anne?
In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by the way; I praise heaven for it.
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou?
shall I not lose my suit?
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
Well, I shall see her to day.
Will I?
i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence; and of other wooers.
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.
Farewell to your worship.
What, have I scaped love letters in the holiday  time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
Let me see.
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him not for his counsellor.
Mistress Page!
trust me, I was going to your house.
And, trust me, I was coming to you.
You look very ill.
Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.
Faith, but you do, in my mind.
Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the contrary.
O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!
What's the matter, woman?
O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such honour!
Hang the trifle, woman!
take the honour.
What is it?
dispense with trifles; what is it?
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be knighted.
What?
thou liest!
Sir Alice Ford!
These knights will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.
Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very words.
What doth he think of us?
'Boarding,' call you it?
I'll be sure to keep him above deck.
So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never to sea again.
Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty.
O, that my husband saw this letter!
it would give eternal food to his jealousy.
You are the happier woman.
Well, I hope it be not so.
Why, sir, my wife is not young.
He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor, Both young and old, one with another, Ford; He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
Love my wife!
With liver burning hot.
What name, sir?
The horn, I say.
Farewell.
I will be patient; I will find out this.
And this is true; I like not the humour of lying.
'The humour of it,' quoth a'!
here's a fellow frights English out of his wits.
I will seek out Falstaff.
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o' the town commended him for a true man.
'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
How now, Meg!
Whither go you, George?
How now, sweet Frank!
why art thou melancholy?
I melancholy!
I am not melancholy.
Get you home, go.
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head.
Now, will you go, Mistress Page?
Have with you.
You'll come to dinner, George.
Trust me, I thought on her: she'll fit it.
You are come to see my daughter Anne?
Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
How now, Master Ford!
You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
Yes: and you heard what the other told me?
Do you think there is truth in them?
Hang 'em, slaves!
Were they his men?
Marry, were they.
I like it never the better for that.
Does he lie at the Garter?
Ay, marry, does he.
If he should intend this voyage towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.
I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to turn them together.
How now, mine host!
How now, bully rook!
thou'rt a gentleman.
Cavaleiro justice, I say!
I follow, mine host, I follow.
Tell him, cavaleiro justice; tell him, bully rook.
Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
What sayest thou, my bully rook?
Will you go with us to behold it?
My merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is Brook; only for a jest.
Have with you, mine host.
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.
Tut, sir, I could have told you more.
In these times you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here, 'tis here.
I have seen the time, with my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
Here, boys, here, here!
shall we wag?
Have with you.
I would rather hear them scold than fight.
I will not lend thee a penny.
Why, then the world's mine oyster.
Not a penny.
Didst not thou share?
hadst thou not fifteen pence?
Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll endanger my soul gratis?
At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you.
I do relent: what would thou more of man?
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
Let her approach.
Give your worship good morrow.
Good morrow, good wife.
Not so, an't please your worship.
Good maid, then.
I'll be sworn, As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
I do believe the swearer.
What with me?
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing.
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:  I pray, come a little nearer this ways:  I myself dwell with master Doctor Caius,
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,
I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine own people.
Are they so?
God bless them and make them his servants!
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?
Why, sir, she's a good creature.
Lord Lord!
your worship's a wanton!
Well, heaven forgive you and all of us, I pray!
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,
But what says she to me?
be brief, my good she Mercury.
Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.
Ten and eleven?
Ten and eleven.
Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.
Why, you say well.
But I have another messenger to your worship.
Blessing on your heart for't!
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
That were a jest indeed!
they have not so little grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed!
Why, I will.
This news distracts me!
Sayest thou so, old Jack?
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
Brook is his name?
Ay, sir.
Call him in.
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such liquor.
Ah, ha!
Mistress Ford and Mistress Page have I encompassed you?
go to; via!
Bless you, sir!
And you, sir!
Would you speak with me?
I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.
You're welcome.
What's your will?
Give us leave, drawer.
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,  I will be brief with you,  and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means, as desire, to make myself acquainted with you.
Very well, sir; proceed.
There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's name is Ford.
Well, sir.
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
Never.
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
Never.
Of what quality was your love, then?
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
When I have told you that, I have told you all.
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her.
O, sir!
Believe it, for you know it.
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
O, understand my drift.
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
O good sir!
I say you shall.
Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none.
I am blest in your acquaintance.
Do you know Ford, sir?
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave!
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.
Hang him, mechanical salt butter rogue!
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this!
My heart is ready to crack with impatience.
Who says this is improvident jealousy?
my wife hath sent to him; the hour is fixed; the match is made.
Would any man have thought this?
See the hell of having a false woman!
My bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong.
Terms!
names!
Jack Rugby!
Sir?
Vat is de clock, Jack?
'Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised to meet.
By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him.
Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.
Alas, sir, I cannot fence.
Villany, take your rapier.
Forbear; here's company.
Bless thee, bully doctor!
Save you, Master Doctor Caius!
Now, good master doctor!
Give you good morrow, sir.
Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de vorld; he is not show his face.
Thou art a Castalion King Urinal.
Hector of Greece, my boy!
I pray you, bear vitness that me have stay six or seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.
Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a man of peace.
Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to make one.
Though we are justices and doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.
'Tis true, Master Shallow.
It will be found so, Master Page.
Master Doctor Caius, I am come to fetch you home.
Pardon, guest justice.
A word, Mounseur Mockwater.
Mock vater!
vat is dat?
Mock water, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.
By gar, den, I have as mush mock vater as de Englishman.
Scurvy jack dog priest!
by gar, me vill cut his ears.
He will clapper claw thee tightly, bully.
Clapper de claw!
vat is dat?
That is, he will make thee amends.
By gar, me do look he shall clapper de claw me; for, by gar, me vill have it.
And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.
Me tank you for dat.
And, moreover, bully,  but first, master guest, and Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you through the town to Frogmore.
Sir Hugh is there, is he?
We will do it.
Adieu, good master doctor.
By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a jack an ape to Anne Page.
For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne Page.
Said I well?
By gar, 'tis good; vell said.
Let us wag, then.
Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.
I pray you now, good master Slender's serving man, and friend Simple by your name, which way have you looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?
I most fehemently desire you you will also look that way.
I will, sir.
'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and trempling of mind!
I shall be glad if he have deceived me.
How melancholies I am!
I will knog his urinals about his knave's costard when I have good opportunities for the ork.
'Pless my soul!
To shallow rivers, to whose falls Melodious birds sings madrigals; There will we make our peds of roses, And a thousand fragrant posies.
To shallow   Mercy on me!
I have a great dispositions to cry.
Melodious birds sing madrigals   When as I sat in Pabylon   And a thousand vagram posies.
To shallow & c.
Yonder he is coming, this way, Sir Hugh.
He's welcome.
No weapons, sir.
There comes my master, Master Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over the stile, this way.
Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms.
How now, master Parson!
Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.
Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student from his book, and it is wonderful.
Ah, sweet Anne Page!
'Save you, good Sir Hugh!
'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!
What, the sword and the word!
do you study them both, master parson?
There is reasons and causes for it.
We are come to you to do a good office, master parson.
Fery well: what is it?
Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike having received wrong by some person, is at most odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.
I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so wide of his own respect.
What is he?
I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the renowned French physician.
Got's will, and his passion of my heart!
I had as lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
Why?
He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,   and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you would desires to be acquainted withal.
I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
O sweet Anne Page!
It appears so by his weapons.
Keep them asunder: here comes Doctor Caius.
Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.
So do you, good master doctor.
Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep their limbs whole and hack our English.
I pray you, let a me speak a word with your ear.
Vherefore vill you not meet a me?
Pray you, use your patience: in good time.
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.
Diable!
Jack Rugby,  mine host de Jarteer,  have I not stay for him to kill him?
have I not, at de place I did appoint?
As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of the Garter.
Ay, dat is very good; excellent.
Peace, I say!
hear mine host of the Garter.
Am I politic?
am I subtle?
am I a Machiavel?
Shall I lose my doctor?
no; he gives me the potions and the motions.
Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh?
no; he gives me the proverbs and the no verbs.
Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so.
Give me thy hand, celestial; so.
Trust me, a mad host.
Follow, gentlemen, follow.
O sweet Anne Page!
Ha, do I perceive dat?
have you make a de sot of us, ha, ha?
This is well; he has made us his vlouting stog.
By gar, with all my heart.
Well, I will smite his noddles.
Pray you, follow.
Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader.
Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf.
Well met, Mistress Page.
Whither go you?
Truly, sir, to see your wife.
Is she at home?
Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company.
I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry.
Be sure of that,  two other husbands.
Where had you this pretty weather cock?
I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of.
What do you call your knight's name, sirrah?
Sir John Falstaff.
Sir John Falstaff!
He, he; I can never hit on's name.
There is such a league between my good man and he!
Is your wife at home indeed?
Indeed she is.
By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.
Has Page any brains?
hath he any eyes?
hath he any thinking?
Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point blank twelve score.
Well met, Master Ford.
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.
I hope I have your good will, father Page.
What say you to young Master Fenton?
Not by my consent, I promise you.
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
I think I shall drink in pipe wine first with him; I'll make him dance.
Will you go, gentles?
Have with you to see this monster.
What, John!
What, Robert!
Quickly, quickly!
is the buck basket
I warrant.
What, Robert, I say!
Come, come, come.
Here, set it down.
Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
You will do it?
I ha' told them over and over; they lack no direction.
Be gone, and come when you are called.
Here comes little Robin.
How now, my eyas musket!
what news with you?
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back door, Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
You little Jack a Lent, have you been true to us?
Ay, I'll be sworn.
My master knows not of your being here and hath threatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he swears he'll turn me away.
Do so.
Go tell thy master I am alone.
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?
O sweet Sir John!
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate, Mistress Ford.
I your lady, Sir John!
alas, I should be a pitiful lady!
Let the court of France show me such another.
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.
What made me love thee?
let that persuade thee there's something extraordinary in thee.
Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds, that come like women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none but thee; and thou deservest it.
Do not betray me, sir.
I fear you love Mistress Page.
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime kiln.
Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it.
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind.
Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford!
here's Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
What's the matter?
how now!
O Mistress Ford, what have you done?
You're shamed, you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
O well a day, Mistress Ford!
having an honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
What cause of suspicion?
What cause of suspicion!
Out pon you!
how am I mistook in you!
Why, alas, what's the matter?
Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.
'Tis not so, I hope.
Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here!
but 'tis most certain your husband's coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one.
I come before to tell you.
If you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here convey, convey him out.
What shall I do?
For shame!
He's too big to go in there.
What shall I do?
Let me see't, let me see't, O, let me see't!
I'll in, I'll in.
Follow your friend's counsel.
I'll in.
What, Sir John Falstaff!
Are these your letters, knight?
I love thee.
Help me away.
Let me creep in here.
Help to cover your master, boy.
Call your men, Mistress Ford.
You dissembling knight!
What, John!
Robert!
John!
Go take up these clothes here quickly.
Where's the cowl staff?
look, how you drumble!
Carry them to the laundress in Datchet meat; quickly, come.
To the laundress, forsooth.
Why, what have you to do whither they bear it?
You were best meddle with buck washing.
Buck!
I would I could wash myself of the buck!
Buck, buck, buck!
Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck; and of the season too, it shall appear.
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to night; I'll tell you my dream.
So, now uncape.
Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
True, Master Page.
This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France.
Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
Is there not a double excellency in this?
I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.
What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket!
I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
Hang him, dishonest rascal!
I would all of the same strain were in the same distress.
I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.
Heard you that?
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
Ay, I do so.
Amen!
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
Ay, ay; I must bear it.
If there be any pody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.
Fie, fie, Master Ford!
are you not ashamed?
What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination?
I would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle.
'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
Well, I promised you a dinner.
Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him.
Any thing.
If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
If dere be one or two, I shall make a the turd.
Pray you, go, Master Page.
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy knave, mine host.
Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!
I see I cannot get thy father's love; Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
Alas, how then?
Why, thou must be thyself.
May be he tells you true.
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall speak for himself.
I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but venturing.
Be not dismayed.
Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.
I come to him.
This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill favor'd faults Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!
And how does good Master Fenton?
Pray you, a word with you.
She's coming; to her, coz.
O boy, thou hadst a father!
I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of him.
Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
Ay, that I will, come cut and long tail, under the degree of a squire.
He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort.
She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.
Now, Master Slender,
Now, good Mistress Anne,
What is your will?
My will!
'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest indeed!
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you.
Your father and my uncle hath made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole!
Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
Why, how now!
what does Master Fenton here?
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
She is no match for you.
Sir, will you hear me?
No, good Master Fenton.
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
Speak to Mistress Page.
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
That's my master, master doctor.
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth And bowl'd to death with turnips!
Come, trouble not yourself.
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to night Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
Now heaven send thee good fortune!
Bardolph, I say,
Here, sir.
Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the Thames?
Well, if I be served such another trick, I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give them to a dog for a new year's gift.
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
L et me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins.
Call her in.
Come in, woman!
By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship good morrow.
Take away these chalices.
Go brew me a pottle of sack finely.
With eggs, sir?
Simple of itself; I'll no pullet sperm in my brewage.
How now!
Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.
Mistress Ford!
Alas the day!
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.
Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see it.
I will tell her.
Do so.
Between nine and ten, sayest thou?
Eight and nine, sir.
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.
Peace be with you, sir.
Bless you, sir!
Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed between me and Ford's wife?
And sped you, sir?
Very ill favoredly, Master Brook.
How so, sir?
Did she change her determination?
What, while you were there?
While I was there.
And did he search for you, and could not find you?
You shall hear.
A buck basket!
By the Lord, a buck basket!
And how long lay you there?
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you have sufferd all this.
My suit then is desperate; you'll undertake her no more?
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus.
'Tis past eight already, sir.
Is it?
I will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her.
Adieu.
You shall have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.
Hum!
ha!
is this a vision?
is this a dream?
do I sleep?
Master Ford awake!
awake, Master Ford!
there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
This 'tis to be married!
this 'tis to have linen and buck baskets!
Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
How now, Sir Hugh!
no school to day?
No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
Blessing of his heart!
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book.
I pray you, ask him some questions in his accidence.
Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your master, be not afraid.
William, how many numbers is in nouns?
Two.
Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say, ''Od's nouns.  '
Peace your tattlings!
What is 'fair,' William?
Pulcher.
Polecats!
there are fairer things than polecats, sure.
You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
What is 'lapis,' William?
A stone.
And what is 'a stone,' William?
A pebble.
Lapis.
That is a good William.
What is he, William, that does lend articles?
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.
Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark: genitivo, hujus.
Well, what is your accusative case?
Accusativo, hinc.
I pray you, have your remembrance, child, accusative, hung, hang, hog.
'Hang hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
Leave your prabbles, 'oman.
What is the focative case, William?
O,  vocativo, O.
Remember, William; focative is caret.
And that's a good root.
'Oman, forbear.
Peace!
What is your genitive case plural, William?
Genitive case!
Ay.
Genitive,  horum, harum, horum.
Vengeance of Jenny's case!
fie on her!
never name her, child, if she be a whore.
For shame, 'oman.
'Oman, art thou lunatics?
hast thou no understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the genders?
Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.
Prithee, hold thy peace.
Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.
Forsooth, I have forgot.
He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
He is a good sprag memory.
Farewell, Mistress Page.
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
Get you home, boy.
Come, we stay too long.
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance.
He's a birding, sweet Sir John.
What, ho, gossip Ford!
what, ho!
Step into the chamber, Sir John.
How now, sweetheart!
who's at home besides yourself?
Why, none but mine own people.
Indeed!
No, certainly.
Speak louder.
Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
Why?
Why, does he talk of him?
How near is he, Mistress Page?
Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.
I am undone!
The knight is here.
Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead man.
What a woman are you!
Away with him, away with him!
Which way should be go?
how should I bestow him?
Shall I put him into the basket again?
No, I'll come no more i' the basket.
May I not go out ere he come?
Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you might slip away ere he came.
But what make you here?
What shall I do?
I'll creep up into the chimney.
There they always use to discharge their birding pieces.
Creep into the kiln hole.
Where is it?
He will seek there, on my word.
I'll go out then.
If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John.
Unless you go out disguised
How might we disguise him?
Alas the day, I know not!
There is no woman's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.
Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather than a mischief.
My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above.
Quick, quick!
we'll come dress you straight: put on the gown the while.
Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
But is my husband coming?
I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket.
Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.
Hang him, dishonest varlet!
we cannot misuse him enough.
Come, come, take it up.
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
Why, this is lunatics!
this is mad as a mad dog!
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
So say I too, sir.
Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty.
Well said, brazen face!
hold it out.
This passes!
Are you not ashamed?
let the clothes alone.
I shall find you anon.
'Tis unreasonable!
Will you take up your wife's clothes?
Come away.
Empty the basket, I say!
Why, man, why?
Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may not he be there again?
If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
Here's no man.
By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you.
Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.
Well, he's not here I seek for.
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
Help to search my house this one time.
What, ho, Mistress Page!
come you and the old woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.
Old woman!
what old woman's that?
Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean!
Have I not forbid her my house?
She comes of errands, does she?
We are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass under the profession of fortune telling.
She works by charms, by spells, by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond our element we know nothing.
Come down, you witch, you hag, you; come down, I say!
Nay, good, sweet husband!
Good gentlemen, let him not strike the old woman.
Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.
I'll prat her.
Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you polecat, you runyon!
out, out!
I'll conjure you, I'll fortune tell you.
Are you not ashamed?
I think you have killed the poor woman.
Nay, he will do it.
'Tis a goodly credit for you.
Hang her, witch!
Will you follow, gentlemen?
Let's obey his humour a little further: come, gentlemen.
Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the altar; it hath done meritorious service.
What think you?
may we, with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?
Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains.
If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.
I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should he not be publicly shamed.
Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would not have things cool.
What duke should that be comes so secretly?
I hear not of him in the court.
Let me speak with the gentlemen: they speak English?
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever I did look upon.
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
Within a quarter of an hour.
Pardon me, wife.
There is no better way than that they spoke of.
How?
to send him word they'll meet him in the park at midnight?
Fie, fie!
he'll never come.
So think I too.
Devise but how you'll use him when he comes, And let us two devise to bring him thither.
Why, yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak: But what of this?
Marry, this is our device; That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
And till he tell the truth, Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound And burn him with their tapers.
The children must Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.
I will teach the children their behaviors; and I will be like a jack an apes also, to burn the knight with my taber.
That will be excellent.
I'll go and buy them vizards.
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies, Finely attired in a robe of white.
That silk will I go buy.
And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away And marry her at Eton.
Go send to Falstaff straight.
Fear not you that.
Go get us properties And tricking for our fairies.
Go, Mistress Ford, Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
What wouldst thou have, boor?
what: thick skin?
speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.
Ha!
a fat woman!
the knight may be robbed: I'll call.
Bully knight!
bully Sir John!
speak from thy lungs military: art thou there?
it is thine host, thine Ephesian, calls.
How now, mine host!
Here's a Bohemian Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman.
Let her descend, bully, let her descend; my chambers are honourable: fie!
There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with me; but she's gone.
Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of Brentford?
Ay, marry, was it, mussel shell: what would you with her?
My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the chain or no.
I spake with the old woman about it.
And what says she, I pray, sir?
Marry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of it.
What are they?
let us know.
Ay, come; quick.
I may not conceal them, sir.
Conceal them, or thou diest.
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
What, sir?
To have her, or no.
Go; say the woman told me so.
May I be bold to say so, sir?
Ay, sir; like who more bold.
Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John.
Was there a wise woman with thee?
Out, alas, sir!
cozenage, mere cozenage!
Where be my horses?
speak well of them, varletto.
Where is mine host?
What is the matter, sir?
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.
Hue and cry, villain, go!
Assist me, knight.
I am undone!
Fly, run, hue and cry, villain!
I am undone!
I would all the world might be cozened; for I have been cozened and beaten too.
Now, whence come you?
From the two parties, forsooth.
The devil take one party and his dam the other!
and so they shall be both bestowed.
I have suffered more for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear.
And have not they suffered?
What tellest thou me of black and blue?
Come up into my chamber.
Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I will give over all.
Yet hear me speak.
Assist me in my purpose, And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
So shall I evermore be bound to thee; Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
Prithee, no more prattling; go.
I'll hold.
This is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.
Away I go.
They say there is divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death.
Away!
I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to get you a pair of horns.
Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
How now, Master Brook!
Master Brook, the matter will be known to night, or never.
Be you in the Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall see wonders.
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?
The night is dark; light and spirits will become it well.
Heaven prosper our sport!
No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
Let's away; follow me.
I know vat I have to do.
Adieu.
Fare you well, sir.
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh?
That cannot choose but amaze him.
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be amazed, he will every way be mocked.
We'll betray him finely.
Against such lewdsters and their lechery Those that betray them do no treachery.
The hour draws on.
To the oak, to the oak!
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute draws on.
Now, the hot blooded gods assist me!
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love set on thy horns.
O powerful love!
that, in some respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man a beast.
You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda.
O omnipotent Love!
how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose!
A fault done first in the form of a beast.
O Jove, a beastly fault!
And then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think on 't, Jove; a foul fault!
When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men do?
Sir John!
art thou there, my deer?
my male deer?
My doe with the black scut!
Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves, hail kissing comfits and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
Alas, what noise?
Heaven forgive our sins
What should this be?
Away, away!
I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would never else cross me thus.
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white, You moonshine revellers and shades of night, You orphan heirs of fixed destiny, Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Where's Bede?
Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set And twenty glow worms shall our lanterns be, To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle earth.
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
A trial, come.
Come, will this wood take fire?
Oh, Oh, Oh!
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now?
Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
And these are not fairies?
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
Well said, fairy Hugh.
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English.
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this?
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?
shall I have a coxcomb of frize?
'Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
'Seese' and 'putter'!
have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English?
This is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking through the realm.
Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
What, a hodge pudding?
a bag of flax?
A puffed man?
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
And as poor as Job?
And as wicked as his wife?
And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
Whoa ho!
ho, father Page!
Son, how now!
how now, son!
have you dispatched?
Dispatched!
I'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.
Of what, son?
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's a great lubberly boy.
If it had not been i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me.
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
What need you tell me that?
I think so, when I took a boy for a girl.
Why, this is your own folly.
Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
Vere is Mistress Page?
Why, did you take her in green?
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
This is strange.
Who hath got the right Anne?
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
How now, Master Fenton!
Pardon, good father!
good my mother, pardon!
Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
Well, what remedy?
Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
When night dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
Well, I will muse no further.
Master Fenton, Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home, And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire; Sir John and all.
Let it be so.
Sir John, To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
I’ll pheeze you, in faith.
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
Y'are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues.
Look in the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris : let the world slide.
Sessa!
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
No, not a denier.
Go by, Saint Jeronimy.
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
I know my remedy.
I must go fetch the thirdborough.
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law.
I’ll not budge an inch, boy.
Let him come, and kindly.
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds.
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord.
Thou art a fool.
If Echo were as fleet, I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all.
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.
I will, my lord.
What’s here?
One dead, or drunk?
See, doth he breathe?
He breathes, my lord.
Were he not warmed with ale, This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.
What think you: if he were conveyed to bed, Wrapped in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, A most delicious banquet by his bed, And brave attendants near him when he wakes, Would not the beggar then forget himself?
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest.
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.
Procure me music ready when he wakes, To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound.
Take him up gently, and to bed with him, And each one to his office when he wakes.
An’t please your Honor, players That offer service to your Lordship.
Bid them come near.
We thank your Honor.
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
So please your Lordship to accept our duty.
With all my heart.
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.
'Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.
I have forgot your name, but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means.
'Tis very true.
Thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in happy time, The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play tonight; But I am doubtful of your modesties, Lest over eyeing of his odd behavior  For yet his Honor never heard a play  You break into some merry passion And so offend him.
For I tell you, sirs, If you should smile, he grows impatient.
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one.
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.
Will ’t please your Lordship drink a cup of sack?
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?
What raiment will your Honor wear today?
I am Christophero Sly.
Call not me “Honor” nor “Lordship.
” I ne'er drank sack in my life.
An if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef.
Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor!
Oh, that a mighty man of such descent, Of such possessions and so high esteem, Should be infusèd with so foul a spirit!
What, would you make me mad?
Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bearherd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket,
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music?
Hark!
Apollo plays,
Say thou wilt course.
Thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
Dost thou love pictures?
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age.
Am I a lord, and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream?
Or have I dreamed till now?
Will ’t please your Mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years!
By my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words.
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door; And rail upon the hostess of the house, And say you would present her at the leet, Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts.
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
Ay, the woman’s maid of the house.
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckoned up, As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece, And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell, And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
Amen.
I thank thee.
Thou shalt not lose by it.
How fares my noble lord?
Marry, I fare well, For here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?
Here, noble lord.
What is thy will with her?
Are you my wife and will not call me “husband”?
My men should call me “lord.
” I am your goodman.
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband, I am your wife in all obedience.
I know it well.
What must I call her?
“Madam.
“Alice Madam,” or “Joan Madam”?
“Madam,” and nothing else.
So lords call ladies.
Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandoned from your bed.
'Tis much.
Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long.
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again.
I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood.
Marry, I will.
Let them play it.
No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
What, household stuff?
It is a kind of history.
Well, we’ll see ’t.
Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world slip.
We shall ne'er be younger.
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine.
I am in all affected as yourself, Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline, Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray, Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
To cart her, rather.
I pray you, sir, is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
“Mates,” maid?
how mean you that?
No mates for you Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.
I wis it is not halfway to her heart.
But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool.
From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!
And me too, good Lord!
Husht, master, here’s some good pastime toward.
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
But in the other’s silence do I see Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio.
Well said, master.
Mum, and gaze your fill.
A pretty peat!
It is best Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.
Hark, Tranio!
Thou may’st hear Minerva speak.
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our goodwill effects Bianca’s grief.
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
Gentlemen, content ye.
I am resolved.
Go in, Bianca.
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
You may go to the devil’s dam!
Your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you.
Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out.
Our cake’s dough on both sides.
Farewell.
Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
So will I, Signior Gremio.
But a word, I pray.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love, to labor and effect one thing specially.
What’s that, I pray?
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
A husband?
A devil!
I say a husband.
I say a devil.
Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
Tush, Gremio.
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.
I cannot tell.
But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross every morning.
Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples.
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold?
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely.
Master, it is no time to chide you now.
Affection is not rated from the heart.
If love have touched you, naught remains but so: Redime te captum quam queas minimo.
Gramercies, lad, go forward.
This contents.
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.
Master, you looked so longly on the maid, Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.
Saw you no more?
Marked you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air.
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir!
If you love the maid, Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her.
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!
But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now ’tis plotted!
I have it, Tranio!
Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Tell me thine first.
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid: That’s your device.
It is.
May it be done?
Not possible.
For who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son, Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house, Nor can we be distinguished by our faces For man or master.
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, And I am tied to be obedient   For so your father charged me at our parting, "Be serviceable to my son," quoth he, Although I think 'twas in another sense   I am content to be Lucentio Because so well I love Lucentio.
Where have I been?
Nay, how now, where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?
Or you stolen his?
Or both?
Pray, what’s the news?
Aye, sir.
Ne'er a whit.
And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth.
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
The better for him.
Would I were so too.
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
Tranio, let’s go.
One thing more rests, that thyself execute, To make one among these wooers.
If thou ask me why, Sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.
My lord, you nod.
You do not mind the play.
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I.
A good matter, surely.
Comes there any more of it?
My lord, ’tis but begun.
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.
Would ’twere done.
Knock, sir?
Whom should I knock?
Is there any man has rebused your Worship?
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
Knock you here, sir?
Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.
My master is grown quarrelsome.
I should knock you first, And then I know after who comes by the worst.
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it.
I’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
Help, mistress, help!
My master is mad.
Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain.
How now, what’s the matter?
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio?
How do you all at Verona?
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato, may I say.
Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
Rise, Grumio, rise.
We will compound this quarrel.
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
A senseless villain, good Hortensio.
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it.
Knock at the gate?
O heavens!
Spake you not these words plain: “Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly”?
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?
Sirrah, begone or talk not, I advise you.
Petruchio, patience.
I am Grumio’s pledge.
Why, this' a heavy chance ’twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home, Where small experience grows.
But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: Antonio, my father, is deceased, And I have thrust myself into this maze, Happily to wive and thrive as best I may.
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd, ill favored wife?
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich.
But thou'rt too much my friend, And I’ll not wish thee to her.
Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice.
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.
Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in, I will continue that I broached in jest.
Hortensio, peace.
Thou know’st not gold’s effect.
Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman.
Her name is Katherina Minola, Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts.
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him.
She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so.
“Katherine the curst!
” A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Here’s no knavery!
See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!
Peace, Grumio.
It is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by a while.
A proper stripling, and an amorous.
O, very well, I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: I’ll have them very fairly bound, All books of love.
See that at any hand, And see you read no other lectures to her.
You understand me.
Over and beside Signior Baptista’s liberality, I’ll mend it with a largess.
Take your paper too.
And let me have them very well perfum’d For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to.
What will you read to her?
O this learning, what a thing it is!
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
Peace, sirrah.
Grumio, mum!
God save you, Signior Gremio.
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going?
To Baptista Minola.
'Tis well.
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress.
So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.
And that his bags shall prove.
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair, I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
I know she is an irksome brawling scold.
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
No?
Say’st me so, friend?
What countryman?
Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me.
And I do hope good days and long to see.
O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to ’t, i' God’s name: You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wildcat?
Will I live?
Will he woo her?
Ay, or I’ll hang her.
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
For he fears none.
Hortensio, hark.
This gentleman is happily arrived, My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
And so we will, provided that he win her.
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Gentlemen, God save you.
If I may be bold, Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
He that has the two fair daughters is ’t he you mean?
Even he, Biondello.
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to
Perhaps him and her, sir.
What have you to do?
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
I love no chiders, sir.
Biondello, let’s away.
Well begun, Tranio.
Sir, a word ere you go.
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
An if I be, sir, is it any offense?
No, if without more words you will get you hence.
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free For me as for you?
But so is not she.
For what reason, I beseech you?
For this reason, if you’ll know: That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
Softly, my masters.
If you be gentlemen, Do me this right: hear me with patience.
What!
This gentleman will out talk us all.
Sir, give him head; I know he’ll prove a jade.
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two, The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty.
Sir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
If it be so, sir, that you are the man Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest, And if you break the ice and do this feat, Achieve the elder, set the younger free For our access, whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive.
And since you do profess to be a suitor, You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, To whom we all rest generally beholding.
O excellent motion!
Fellows, let’s be gone.
The motion’s good indeed and be it so.
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
Good sister, wrong me not nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.
That I disdain.
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lovest best.
See thou dissemble not.
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other.
Minion, thou liest.
Is ’t not Hortensio?
Oh, then belike you fancy riches more.
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay, then you jest, and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while.
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
Why, how now, dame!
whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside.
Poor girl, she weeps!
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit!
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be revenged.
What, in my sight?
Bianca, get thee in.
What, will you not suffer me?
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.
Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!
And you, good sir.
Pray, have you not a daughter Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?
I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.
You are too blunt.
Go to it orderly.
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.
Give me leave.
You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katherine, this I know, She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
I see you do not mean to part with her, Or else you like not of my company.
Mistake me not.
I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir?
I know him well.
You are welcome for his sake.
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
Bacare, you are marvelous forward.
Oh, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing.
I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your wooing.
Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
Lucentio is your name.
Of whence, I pray?
Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.
A mighty man of Pisa.
By report I know him well.
You are very welcome, sir.
Take you the lute,    and you the set of books.
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.
Why, that is nothing.
For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.
But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited.
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter.
She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
I pray you do.
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
“Moved,” in good time.
Let him that moved you hither Remove you hence.
I knew you at the first You were a moveable.
Why, what’s a moveable?
A joint stool.
Thou hast hit it.
Come, sit on me.
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light
Too light for such a swain as you to catch, And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
“Should be” should buzz!
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
O slow winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
Come, come, you wasp.
I' faith, you are too angry.
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
My remedy is then to pluck it out.
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
In his tail.
In his tongue.
Whose tongue?
Yours, if you talk of tales.
And so farewell.
What, with my tongue in your tail?
Nay, come again, Good Kate.
I am a gentleman.
That I’ll try.
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.
So may you lose your arms.
If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
A herald, Kate?
Oh, put me in thy books!
What is your crest?
A coxcomb?
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
No cock of mine.
You crow too like a craven.
Nay, come, Kate, come.
You must not look so sour.
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.
There is, there is.
Then show it me.
Had I a glass, I would.
What, you mean my face?
Well aimed of such a young one.
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
Yet you are withered.
'Tis with cares.
I care not.
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you ’scape not so.
I chafe you, if I tarry.
Let me go.
No, not a whit.
I find you passing gentle.
Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
It is extempore, from my mother wit.
A witty mother!
Witless else her son.
Am I not wise?
Yes, keep you warm.
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
How but well, sir?
How but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?
In your dumps?
Call you me daughter?
Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her.
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
Hark, Petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first.
Is this your speeding?
Nay, then, good night our part.
Be patient, gentlemen.
I choose her for myself.
If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?
'Tis bargained ’twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me.
O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices!
'Tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate.
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
I know not what to say, but give me your hands.
God send you joy, Petruchio.
'Tis a match.
Amen, say we.
We will be witnesses.
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice.
Sunday comes apace.
We will have rings, and things, and fine array, And kiss me, Kate.
We will be married o' Sunday.
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part, And venture madly on a desperate mart.
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.
'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back.
'Tis age that nourisheth.
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Content you, gentlemen.
I will compound this strife.
That “only” came well in.
Sir, list to me: I am my father’s heir and only son.
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all.
That she shall have, besides an argosy That now is lying in Marcellus' road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?
Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses, And twelve tight galleys.
These I will assure her, And twice as much whate'er thou offer’st next.
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, By your firm promise.
Gremio is outvied.
That’s but a cavil: he is old, I young.
And may not young men die as well as old?
Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved.
On Sunday next, you know My daughter Katherina is to be married.
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca Be bride to you, if you make this assurance.
If not, to Signior Gremio.
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
Adieu, good neighbor.
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good.
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father, called “supposed Vincentio”  And that’s a wonder.
Fathers commonly Do get their children.
But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
Fiddler, forbear.
You grow too forward, sir.
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherina welcomed you withal?
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.
I’ll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down.
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles.
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
That will be never.
Tune your instrument.
Where left we last?
Here, madam: Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus, Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.
Construe them.
Madam, my instrument’s in tune.
Let’s hear.
O fie!
The treble jars.
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
Now let me see if I can construe it.
Hic ibat Simois , I know you not, hic est Sigeia tellus , I trust you not, Hic steterat Priami , take heed he hear us not, regia , presume not, celsa senis, despair not.
Madam, ’tis now in tune.
All but the base.
The base is right; ’tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
Pedascule , I’ll watch you better yet.
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
Mistrust it not, for sure Aeacides Was Ajax, called so from his grandfather.
I must believe my master; else, I promise you, I should be arguing still upon that doubt.
But let it rest.
Now, Litio, to you.
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
You may go walk, and give me leave awhile.
My lessons make no music in three parts.
Are you so formal, sir?
Well, I must wait.
And watch withal, for, but I be deceived, Our fine musician groweth amorous.
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up.
You know tomorrow is the wedding day.
Farewell, sweet masters both.
I must be gone.
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale, Seize thee that list!
If once I find thee ranging, Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married, And yet we hear not of our son in law.
What will be said?
What mockery will it be, To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
No shame but mine.
I must, forsooth, be forced To give my hand, opposed against my heart, Unto a mad brain rudesby, full of spleen, Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure.
Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
Would Katherine had never seen him, though!
Go, girl.
Master, master!
News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!
Is it new and old too?
How may that be?
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?
Is he come?
Why, no, sir.
What then?
He is coming.
When will he be here?
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
But say, what to thine old news?
Who comes with him?
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat and the humor of forty fancies pricked in ’t for a feather.
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.
'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion, Yet oftentimes he goes but mean appareled.
I am glad he’s come, howsoe'er he comes.
Why, sir, he comes not.
Didst thou not say he comes?
Who?
That Petruchio came?
Ay, that Petruchio came.
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
Why, that’s all one.
Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many.
Come, where be these gallants?
Who’s at home?
You are welcome, sir.
And yet I come not well.
And yet you halt not.
Not so well appareled as I wish you were.
Were it better I should rush in thus  But where is Kate?
Where is my love?
How does my father?
Gentles, methinks you frown.
And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument, Some comet or unusual prodigy?
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.
First were we sad, fearing you would not come, Now sadder that you come so unprovided.
And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detained you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself.
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.
See not your bride in these unreverent robes.
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
Not I, believe me.
Thus I’ll visit her.
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
Good sooth, even thus.
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.
I’ll after him, and see the event of this.
That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business.
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
A bridegroom, say you?
'Tis a groom indeed, A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.
What said the wench when he rose again?
Is ’t possible you will away tonight?
I must away today, before night come.
Make it no wonder.
If you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife.
Dine with my father, drink a health to me, For I must hence, and farewell to you all.
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
It may not be.
Let me entreat you.
It cannot be.
Let me entreat you.
I am content.
Are you content to stay?
Now, if you love me, stay.
Grumio, my horse.
Ay, sir, they be ready.
The oats have eaten the horses.
O Kate, content thee.
Prithee, be not angry.
I will be angry.
What hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet.
He shall stay my leisure.
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist.
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her.
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
Of all mad matches never was the like.
Mistress, what’s your opinion of your sister?
That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated.
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
Neighbors and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom’s place, And let Bianca take her sister’s room.
Shall sweet Bianca practice how to bride it?
She shall, Lucentio.
Come, gentlemen, let’s go.
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways!
Was ever man so beaten?
Was ever man so 'rayed?
Who is that calls so coldly?
A piece of ice.
If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck.
A fire, good Curtis.
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
O, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.
Cast on no water.
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?
She was, good Curtis, before this frost.
But thou knowest winter tames man, woman and beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.
Away, you three inch fool!
I am no beast.
Am I but three inches?
Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least.
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and therefore fire!
Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
There’s fire ready.
And therefore, good Grumio, the news.
Why, “Jack, boy!
Ho, boy!
” and as much news as wilt thou.
Come, you are so full of cony catching!
Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold.
Where’s the cook?
All ready.
And therefore, I pray thee, news.
First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out.
How?
Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale.
Let’s ha' ’t, good Grumio.
Lend thine ear.
Here.
There!
This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale.
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.
Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress
Both of one horse?
What’s that to thee?
Why, a horse.
Tell thou the tale!
But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse.
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home.
But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit.
Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse tail till they kiss their hands.
Are they all ready?
They are.
Call them forth.
Do you hear, ho?
you must meet my master to countenance my mistress.
Why, she hath a face of her own.
Who knows not that?
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
I call them forth to credit her.
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
Welcome home, Grumio.
How now, Grumio?
What, Grumio!
Fellow Grumio!
How now, old lad?
Welcome, you!
How now, you?
What, you!
Fellow, you!
And thus much for greeting.
Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
All things is ready.
How near is our master?
E'en at hand, alighted by this.
And therefore be not  Cock’s passion, silence!
I hear my master.
Where be these knaves?
What, no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
Here, here, sir!
Here, sir!
“Here, sir!
Here, sir!
Here, sir!
Here, sir!
” You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms!
What, no attendance?
No regard?
No duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.
You peasant swain!
You whoreson malt horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel.
There was no link to color Peter’s hat, And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing.
There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory.
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Patience, I pray you!
'Twas a fault unwilling.
A whoreson, beetle headed, flap eared knave!
Come, Kate, sit down.
I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?
What’s this?
Mutton?
Ay.
Who brought it?
I.
'Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these!
Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not?
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away.
Peter, didst ever see the like?
He kills her in her own humor.
Where is he?
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.
Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said, Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
What, master, read you?
First resolve me that.
I read that I profess, The Art to Love.
And may you prove, sir, master of your art.
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
Quick proceeders, marry!
O despiteful love!
Unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!
Mistake no more.
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca, And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, I will with you, if you be so contented, Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
See how they kiss and court!
And here I take the like unfeignèd oath Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.
Fie on her!
See how beastly she doth court him!
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace As 'longeth to a lover’s blessèd case!
Tranio, you jest.
But have you both forsworn me?
Mistress, we have.
Then we are rid of Litio.
God give him joy!
Ay, and he’ll tame her.
He says so, Tranio?
Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.
The taming school?
What, is there such a place?
O master, master, I have watched so long That I am dog weary, but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn.
What is he, Biondello?
Master, a marcantant, or a pedant, I know not what, but formal in apparel, In gait and countenance surely like a father.
And what of him, Tranio?
If he be credulous and trust my tale, I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
God save you, sir.
And you, sir.
You are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two, But then up farther, and as far as Rome, And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
What countryman, I pray?
Of Mantua.
Of Mantua, sir?
Marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?
My life, sir!
how, I pray?
For that goes hard.
'Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua.
Know you not the cause?
Well, sir, to do you courtesy, This will I do, and this I will advise you.
First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renownèd for grave citizens.
Among them know you one Vincentio?
I know him not, but I have heard of him: A merchant of incomparable wealth.
He is my father, sir, and sooth to say, In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.
O sir, I do, and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty.
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand: My father is here looked for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here.
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars that come unto my father’s door Upon entreaty have a present alms.
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity.
But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed.
What say you to a neat’s foot?
'Tis passing good.
I prithee let me have it.
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled?
I like it well.
Good Grumio, fetch it me.
I cannot tell.
I fear ’tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
A dish that I do love to feed upon.
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
Nay then, I will not.
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
Why then, the mustard without the beef.
How fares my Kate?
What, sweeting, all amort?
Mistress, what cheer?
Faith, as cold as can be.
Pluck up thy spirits.
Look cheerfully upon me.
Here love, thou seest how diligent I am, To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word?
Nay, then thou lov’st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.
I pray you, let it stand.
The poorest service is repaid with thanks, And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
I thank you, sir.
Signior Petruchio, fie, you are to blame.
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.
Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart.
Kate, eat apace.
And now, my honey love, Will we return unto thy father’s house And revel it as bravely as the best, With silken coats and caps and golden rings, With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things, With scarves and fans and double change of brav'ry, With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
What, hast thou dined?
The tailor stays thy leisure To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.
Why, this was molded on a porringer!
A velvet dish!
Fie, fie, ’tis lewd and filthy!
Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell, A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.
Away with it!
Come, let me have a bigger.
I’ll have no bigger.
This doth fit the time, And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.
That will not be in haste.
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak, And speak I will.
I am no child, no babe.
Your betters have endured me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
Why, thou say’st true.
It is a paltry cap, A custard coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.
Love me or love me not, I like the cap, And it I will have, or I will have none.
Thy gown?
Why, ay.
Come, tailor, let us see ’t.
O mercy, God!
What masking stuff is here?
What’s this?
A sleeve?
'Tis like a demi cannon.
I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.
You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time.
Marry, and did.
But if you be remembered, I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
I never saw a better fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
She says your Worship means to make a puppet of her.
O monstrous arrogance!
Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble, Thou yard, three quarters, half yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant, Or I shall so be mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.
Your Worship is deceived.
The gown is made Just as my master had direction.
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
I gave him no order.
I gave him the stuff.
But how did you desire it should be made?
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
But did you not request to have it cut?
Thou hast faced many things.
I have.
Face not me.
Thou hast braved many men; brave not me.
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
Read it.
The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.
“ Imprimis, a loose bodied gown ”
Master, if ever I said “loose bodied gown,” sew me in the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread.
I said “a gown.
Proceed.
“With a small compassed cape ”
I confess the cape.
“With a trunk sleeve ”
I confess two sleeves.
“The sleeves curiously cut.
Ay, there’s the villany.
Error i' the bill, sir, error i' the bill!
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again, and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
This is true that I say: an I had thee in place where, thou shouldst know it.
I am for thee straight.
Take thou the bill, give me thy mete  yard, and spare not me.
God a mercy, Grumio!
Then he shall have no odds.
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
Go, take it up unto thy master’s use.
Villain, not for thy life!
Take up my mistress' gown for thy master’s use!
Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use!
O, fie, fie, fie!
Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
Go, take it hence.
Begone, and say no more.
Tailor, I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow.
Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
Away, I say.
Commend me to thy master.
Well, come, my Kate.
We will unto your father’s Even in these honest mean habiliments.
I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two, And ’twill be supper time ere you come there.
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, You are still crossing it.
Sirs, let ’t alone.
Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
Sir, this is the house.
Please it you that I call?
Ay, what else?
and but I be deceived, Signior Baptista may remember me, Near twenty years ago, in Genoa, Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
I warrant you.
Fear you not him.
Sirrah Biondello, Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.
Tut, fear not me.
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
I told him that your father was at Venice, And that you looked for him this day in Padua.
Thou'rt a tall fellow.
Hold thee that to drink.
Gives money
Soft son.
Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself.
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections.
I thank you, sir.
Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part’s agreement stand?
Then at my lodging, an it like you.
There doth my father lie, and there this night We’ll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here.
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
It likes me well.
Cambio, hie you home, And bid Bianca make her ready straight.
And, if you will, tell what hath happenèd: Lucentio’s father is arrived in Padua, And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome!
I follow you.
Cambio.
What sayest thou, Biondello?
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
Biondello, what of that?
I pray thee, moralize them.
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
And what of him?
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
And then?
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours.
And what of all this?
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance.
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum.
To th' church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
Hear’st thou, Biondello?
I cannot tarry.
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir.
And so adieu, sir.
I may, and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleased.
Then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her.
It shall go hard if “Cambio” go without her.
Come on, i' God’s name, once more toward our father’s.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
The moon?
The sun!
It is not moonlight now.
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
I say it is the moon.
I know it is the moon.
Nay, then you lie.
It is the blessèd sun.
Then God be blessed, it is the blessèd sun.
But sun it is not, when you say it is not, And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is, And so it shall be so for Katherine.
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
Well, forward, forward!
Thus the bowl should run, And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft!
Company is coming here.
He will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child.
Happier the man whom favorable stars Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow!
Why, how now, Kate!
I hope thou art not mad.
This is a man old, wrinkled, faded, withered  And not a maiden, as thou say’st he is.
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known Which way thou travellest.
If along with us, We shall be joyful of thy company.
What is his name?
Lucentio, gentle sir.
Happily met, the happier for thy son.
And now by law as well as reverend age, I may entitle thee my loving father.
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married.
Wonder not Nor be grieved.
She is of good esteem, Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth.
Beside, so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio, And wander we to see thy honest son, Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
Come, go along and see the truth hereof, For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
I fly, Biondello.
But they may chance to need thee at home.
Therefore leave us.
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a' your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Sir, here’s the door.
This is Lucentio’s house.
My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
You shall not choose but drink before you go.
I think I shall command your welcome here, And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
They’re busy within.
You were best knock louder.
What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal?
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself.
He shall need none so long as I live.
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir?
To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him.
Thou liest.
His father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window.
Art thou his father?
Ay, sir, so his mother says, if I may believe her.
Why, how now, gentleman!
Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man’s name.
Lay hands on the villain.
I believe he means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
I have seen them in the church together.
God send 'em good shipping!
But who is here?
Mine old master Vincentio!
Now we are undone and brought to nothing.
Come hither, crack hemp.
Hope I may choose, sir.
Come hither, you rogue!
What, have you forgot me?
Forgot you!
No, sir.
I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life.
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy master’s father, Vincentio?
What, my old worshipful old master?
Yes, marry, sir.
See where he looks out of the window.
Is ’t so, indeed.
Help, help, help!
Here’s a madman will murder me.
Help, son!
Help, Signior Baptista!
Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
What am I, sir!
Nay, what are you, sir?
O immortal gods!
O fine villain!
A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat!
Oh, I am undone, I am undone!
While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.
How now, what’s the matter?
What, is the man lunatic?
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman.
Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold?
I thank my good father I am able to maintain it.
Thy father!
O villain!
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.
Pray, what do you think is his name?
His name!
As if I knew not his name!
I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
Away, away, mad ass!
His name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
Lucentio!
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke’s name.
O my son, my son!
Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
Call forth an officer.
Carry me to the jail?
Stay, officer.
He shall not go to prison.
Talk not, Signior Gremio.
I say he shall go to prison.
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony catched in this business.
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
Swear, if thou darest.
Nay, I dare not swear it.
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
Away with the dotard!
To the jail with him!
Thus strangers may be haled and abused.
O monstrous villain!
O!
We are spoiled and yonder he is!
Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.
Pardon, sweet father.
Lives my sweet son?
Pardon, dear father.
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?
Here’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
Where is that damnèd villain, Tranio, That faced and braved me in this matter so?
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
Love wrought these miracles.
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail.
But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill?
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you.
Go to.
But I will in to be revenged for this villany.
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
Look not pale, Bianca.
Thy father will not frown.
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
What, in the midst of the street?
What, art thou ashamed of me?
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.
Why, then let’s home again.
Come, sirrah, let’s away.
Nay, I will give thee a kiss.
Now pray thee, love, stay.
Is not this well?
Come, my sweet Kate.
Better once than never, for never too late.
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Then never trust me if I be afeard.
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
Roundly replied.
Mistress, how mean you that?
Thus I conceive by him.
Conceives by me?
How likes Hortensio that?
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
Very well mended.
Kiss him for that, good widow.
“He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”  I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe.
And now you know my meaning.
A very mean meaning.
Right, I mean you.
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
To her, Kate!
To her, widow!
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
That’s my office.
Spoke like an officer!
Ha' to thee, lad!
How likes Gremio these quick witted folks?
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
Head and butt!
An hasty witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
Ay, but not frighted me.
Therefore I’ll sleep again.
Nay, that you shall not.
Since you have begun, Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
Am I your bird?
I mean to shift my bush, And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
She hath prevented me.
Here, Signior Tranio, This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.
Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.
Oh, sir, Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound, Which runs himself and catches for his master.
A good swift simile, but something currish.
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
Oh, Oh, Petruchio!
Tranio hits you now.
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
He has a little galled me, I confess.
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
Well, I say no.
Content.
What’s the wager?
Twenty crowns.
Twenty crowns?
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife.
A hundred then.
Content.
A match!
'Tis done.
Who shall begin?
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
I go.
Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.
I’ll have no halves.
I’ll bear it all myself.
Sir, my mistress sends you word That she is busy, and she cannot come.
How!
“She’s busy, and she cannot come!
” Is that an answer?
Ay, and a kind one too.
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
I hope better.
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith.
O, ho, entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.
I am afraid, sir, Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
She says you have some goodly jest in hand.
She will not come.
She bids you come to her.
Worse and worse.
She will not come!
O vile, intolerable, not to be endured!
I know her answer.
What?
She will not.
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
Now, by my holidam, here comes Katherina!
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
Go fetch them hither.
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
And so it is.
I wonder what it bodes.
Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, And awful rule, and right supremacy, And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy?
Now, fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
Nay, I will win my wager better yet, And show more sign of her obedience, Her new built virtue and obedience.
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
Fie!
What a foolish duty call you this?
I would your duty were as foolish too.
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime.
The more fool you for laying on my duty.
Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Come, come, you’re mocking.
We will have no telling.
Come on, I say, and first begin with her.
She shall not.
I say she shall.
And first begin with her.
Fie, fie!
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, And in no sense is meet or amiable.
Why, there’s a wench!
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha ’t.
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
Boatswain!
Here, master.
What cheer?
Good, speak to th' mariners.
Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground.
Bestir, bestir.
Heigh, my hearts!
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Yare!
Yare!
Take in the topsail.
Tend to th' master’s whistle.
Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
Good Boatswain, have care.
Where’s the Master?
Play the men.
I pray now, keep below.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
Do you not hear him?
You mar our labor.
Keep your cabins.
You do assist the storm.
Nay, good, be patient.
When the sea is.
Hence!
What cares these roarers for the name of king?
To cabin, silence!
Trouble us not.
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
None that I more love than myself.
You are a councilor.
If you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more.
I have great comfort from this fellow.
Down with the topmast!
Yare, lower, lower!
Bring her to try wi' th' main course.
A plague upon this howling!
They are louder than the weather or our office.
Yet again?
What do you here?
Shall we give o'er and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?
Work you, then.
Hang, cur!
Hang, you whoreson insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
Lay her a hold, a hold!
Set her two courses off to sea again.
Lay her off!
All lost!
To prayers, to prayers, all lost!
What, must our mouths be cold?
The king and prince at prayers.
Let’s assist them, for our case is as theirs.
I’m out of patience.
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
This wide chopped rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
Mercy on us!
We split, we split!
Farewell, my wife and children!
Farewell, brother!
We split, we split, we split!
Let’s all sink wi' th' king.
Let’s take leave of him.
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown furze, anything.
The wills above be done, but I would fain die a dry death.
If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
Be collected.
No more amazement.
Oh, woe the day!
No harm.
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.
'Tis time I should inform thee farther.
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me.
Lie there, my art.
Wipe thou thine eyes.
Have comfort.
The hour’s now come.
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.
Obey and be attentive.
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.
Certainly, sir, I can.
By what?
By any other house or person?
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance.
'Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants.
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me?
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.
But how is it That this lives in thy mind?
What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst.
But that I do not.
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.
Sir, are not you my father?
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter.
And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.
Oh, the heavens!
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessèd was ’t we did?
Both, both, my girl.
By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither.
Oh, my heart bleeds To think o' th' teen that I have turned you to, Which is from my remembrance!
Please you, farther.
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio  I pray thee, mark me
Sir, most heedfully.
O, good sir, I do.
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature.
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
Oh, the heavens!
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother.
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Now the condition.
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t.
Hear a little further And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent.
Well demanded, wench.
My tale provokes that question.
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!
Oh, a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me.
How came we ashore?
By providence divine.
Would I might But ever see that man!
Now I arise.
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea sorrow.
Heavens thank you for ’t!
Know thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune    hath mine enemies Brought to this shore.
Come away, servant, come.
I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.
All hail, great master!
Grave sir, hail!
I come To answer thy best pleasure, be ’t to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds.
To thy strong bidding, task Ariel and all his quality.
Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?
To every article.
I boarded the king’s ship.
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason?
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation.
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me.
The king’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up staring then, like reeds, not hair  Was the first man that leaped, cried, “Hell is empty And all the devils are here.
”
Why, that’s my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
Close by, my master.
But are they, Ariel, safe?
Not a hair perished.
Of the king’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed.
But there’s more work.
What is the time o' th' day?
Past the mid season.
At least two glasses.
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Is there more toil?
Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.
How now?
Moody?
What is ’t thou canst demand?
My liberty.
Before the time be out?
No more!
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?
No.
I do not, sir.
Thou liest, malignant thing!
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?
Hast thou forgot her?
No, sir.
Thou hast.
Where was she born?
Speak.
Tell me.
Sir, in Argier.
Oh, was she so?
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget’st.
This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banished.
For one thing she did They would not take her life.
Is not this true?
Ay, sir.
This blue eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors.
Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant.
Yes, Caliban, her son.
Dull thing, I say so.
He, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service.
Thou best know’st What torment I did find thee in.
Thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears.
I thank thee, master.
If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.
Pardon, master.
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently.
Do so, and after two days
That’s my noble master!
What shall I do?
Say, what?
What shall I do?
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea.
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else.
Go take this shape And hither come in ’t.
Go hence with diligence.
Awake, dear heart, awake!
Thou hast slept well.
Awake!
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me.
Shake it off.
Come on.
We’ll visit Caliban, my slave who never Yields us kind answer.
'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him.
He does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us.
What, ho!
Slave!
Caliban!
Thou earth, thou!
There’s wood enough within.
Come forth, I say!
There’s other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise!
When?
Fine apparition!
My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear.
My lord it shall be done.
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps, Side stitches that shall pen thy breath up.
Urchins Shall, forth at vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee.
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em.
I must eat my dinner.
This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me.
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!
Oh ho, oh ho!
Would ’t had been done!
Thou didst prevent me.
You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse.
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!
Hag seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel.
And be quick, thou 'rt best, To answer other business.
No, pray thee.
I must obey.
His art is of such power, It would control my dam’s god, Setebos, And make a vassal of him.
So, slave, hence!
Bow wow.
The watchdogs bark.
Bow wow.
Hark, hark!
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock a diddle dow.
”
Where should this music be?
I' th' air or th' earth?
It sounds no more, and sure, it waits upon Some god o' th' island.
Ding dong.
Hark, now I hear them.
Ding dong, bell.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes.
I hear it now above me.
The fringèd curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond.
What is ’t?
A spirit?
Lord, how it looks about!
Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form.
But ’tis a spirit.
No, wench!
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such.
This gallant which thou seest Was in the wrack.
And, but he’s something stained With grief that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call him A goodly person.
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em.
I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
It goes on, I see, As my soul prompts it.
Most sure, the goddess On whom these airs attend!
Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island, And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here.
No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid.
My language!
Heavens, I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where ’tis spoken.
How?
The best?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.
He does hear me, And that he does I weep.
Alack, for mercy!
The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee If now ’twere fit to do ’t!
At the first sight They have changed eyes.
Delicate Ariel,
Why speaks my father so ungently?
Oh, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you The queen of Naples.
Soft, sir!
One word more.
No, as I am a man!
There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with ’t.
Follow me.
Speak not you for him.
He’s a traitor.
Come, I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together.
Seawater shalt thou drink.
Thy food shall be The fresh brook muscles, withered roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled.
Follow.
What, I say?
Beseech you, father.
Hence!
Hang not on my garments.
Sir, have pity, I’ll be his surety.
Silence!
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.
What, An advocate for an imposter?
My affections Are then most humble.
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.
Come on.
Obey.
Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigor in them.
So they are.
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid.
All corners else o' th' earth Let liberty make use of.
Space enough Have I in such a prison.
It works!
Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
Follow me.
Hark what thou else shalt do me.
Be of comfort.
My father’s of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech.
This is unwonted Which now came from him.
Thou shalt be free As mountain winds.
But then exactly do All points of my command.
To th' syllable.
Come, follow.
Speak not for him.
Beseech you, sir, be merry.
You have cause, So have we all, of joy, for our escape Is much beyond our loss.
Prithee, peace.
Sir
One.
Tell.
A dollar.
Dolor comes to him, indeed.
You have spoken truer than you purposed.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Therefore, my lord
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
I prithee, spare.
Well, I have done.
But yet
He will be talking.
The old cock.
The cockerel.
Done.
The wager?
A laughter.
A match!
Though this island seem to be desert
Ha, ha, ha!
So you’re paid.
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
Yet
Yet
He could not miss ’t.
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
Temperance was a delicate wench.
Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
Here is everything advantageous to life.
True.
Save means to live.
Of that there’s none, or little.
How lush and lusty the grass looks!
How green!
The ground indeed is tawny.
With an eye of green in ’t.
He misses not much.
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.
But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit
As many vouched rarities are.
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new dyed than stained with salt water.
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
Not since widow Dido’s time.
Widow!
A pox o' that!
How came that “widow” in?
Widow Dido!
What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too?
Good Lord, how you take it!
“Widow Dido” said you?
You make me study of that.
She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Carthage?
I assure you, Carthage.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
Ay.
Why, in good time.
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.
And the rarest that e'er came there.
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
Oh, widow Dido?
Ay, widow Dido.
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it?
I mean, in a sort.
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.
Would I had never Married my daughter there!
Sir, he may live.
I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs.
No, no, he’s gone.
Prithee, peace.
So is the dearest o' th' loss.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in.
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.
Very well.
And most chirurgeonly.
It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy.
Foul weather?
Very foul.
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord
He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.
Or docks, or mallows.
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things.
For no kind of traffic Would I admit.
No name of magistrate.
Letters should not be known.
Riches, poverty, And use of service none.
Contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard none.
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil.
No occupation.
Yet he would be king on ’t.
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor.
Treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, Would I not have.
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.
No marrying ’mong his subjects?
None, man.
All idle.
Whores and knaves.
'Save his majesty!
Long live Gonzalo!
And do you mark me, sir?
Prithee, no more.
Thou dost talk nothing to me.
'Twas you we laughed at.
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you.
So you may continue and laugh at nothing still.
What a blow was there given!
An it had not fallen flat long.
You are gentlemen of brave mettle.
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
No, I warrant you.
I will not adventure my discretion so weakly.
Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?
Go sleep, and hear us.
What, all so soon asleep?
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts.
I find They are inclined to do so.
Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it.
It seldom visits sorrow.
When it doth, It is a comforter.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety.
Thank you.
Wondrous heavy.
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
It is the quality o' th' climate.
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.
Nor I.
My spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent.
They dropped, as by a thunderstroke.
What might, Worthy Sebastian, O, what might ?
No more.
And yet methinks I see it in thy face, What thou shouldst be.
Th' occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head.
What, art thou waking?
Do you not hear me speak?
I do, and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep.
What is it thou didst say?
Noble Sebastian, Thou let’st thy fortune sleep die, rather wink’st Whiles thou art waking.
Thou dost snore distinctly.
There’s meaning in thy snores.
I am more serious than my custom.
You Must be so too if heed me, which to do Trebles thee o'er.
Well, I am standing water.
I’ll teach you how to flow.
Do so.
To ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me.
Oh, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it!
Prithee, say on.
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee, and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield.
Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earthed  hath here almost persuade    the king his son’s alive, 'Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned And he that sleeps here swims.
I have no hope That he’s undrowned.
Oh, out of that “no hope” What great hope have you!
He’s gone.
Then, tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?
Claribel.
What stuff is this?
How say you?
A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples?
Keep in Tunis, And let Sebastian wake.
” Say this were death That now hath seized them.
Why, they were no worse Than now they are.
Methinks I do.
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero.
True.
And look how well my garments sit upon me, Much feater than before.
My brother’s servants Were then my fellows.
Now they are my men.
But, for your conscience?
Ay, sir.
Where lies that?
If ’twere a kibe, 'Twould put me to my slipper.
But I feel not This deity in my bosom.
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent.
As thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples.
Draw thy sword.
Draw together.
And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo.
O, but one word.
Then let us both be sudden.
Now, good angels preserve the king!
Why, how now?
Ho, awake!
What’s the matter?
Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions.
Did ’t not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
I heard nothing.
Oh, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake!
Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
I shaked you, sir, and cried.
As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn.
There was a noise, That’s verily.
'Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that we quit this place.
Let’s draw our weapons.
Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search For my poor son.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' th' island.
Lead away.
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done.
So, King, go safely on to seek thy son.
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him By inchmeal a disease!
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse.
But they’ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin shows, pitch me i' th' mire, Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid 'em.
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly.
I’ll fall flat.
Perchance he will not mind me.

Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all.
And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i' th' wind.
Alas, the storm is come again!
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine.
T here is no other shelter hereabouts.
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

Do not torment me.
Oh!
What’s the matter?
Have we devils here?
Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha?
I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs.
The spirit torments me.
Oh!
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got, as I take it, an ague.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
I will give him some relief if it be but for that.
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any
Do not torment me, prithee.
I’ll bring my wood home faster.
He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest.
He shall taste of my bottle.
If he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit.
Thou dost me yet but little hurt.
Thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling.
Now Prosper works upon thee.
Come on your ways.
Open your mouth.
Here is that which will give language to you, cat.
Open your mouth.
This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly.
You cannot tell who’s your friend.
Open your chaps again.
I should know that voice.
Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster.
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend.
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.
Come.
Amen!
I will pour some in thy other mouth.
Stephano!
Doth thy other mouth call me?
Mercy, mercy!
This is a devil, and no monster.
I will leave him.
I have no long spoon.
Stephano!
If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
For I am Trinculo be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo.
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth.
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.
If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.
Thou art very Trinculo indeed!
How camest thou to be the siege of this mooncalf?
Can he vent Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?
I hope now thou art not drowned.
Is the storm overblown?
I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.
And art thou living, Stephano?
O Stephano, two Neapolitans ’scaped!
Prithee, do not turn me about.
My stomach is not constant.
These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
That’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.
How didst thou ’scape?
How camest thou hither?
Swear by this bottle how thou camest hither.
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard, by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.
I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
Swum ashore, man, like a duck.
I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn.
Here, kiss the book.
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
O Stephano, hast any more of this?
The whole butt, man.
My cellar is in a rock by th' seaside where my wine is hid.
How now, mooncalf?
How does thine ague?
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee.
I was the man i’ the moon when time was.
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee.
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
I’ll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island.
And I will kiss thy foot.
I prithee, be my god.
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster.
When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.
I’ll kiss thy foot.
I’ll swear myself thy subject.
Come on then.
Down, and swear.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster.
A most scurvy monster.
I could find in my heart to beat him
Come, kiss.
But that the poor monster’s in drink.
An abominable monster!
I’ll show thee the best springs.
I’ll pluck thee berries.
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow.
I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking.
Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.
Here, bear my bottle.
Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.
Farewell, master!
Farewell, farewell.
A howling monster, a drunken monster.
O brave monster!
Lead the way.
There be some sports are painful, and their labor Delight in them sets off.
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone.
Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard.
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you.
When this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you.
My father Is hard at study.
Pray now, rest yourself.
He’s safe for these three hours.
O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do.
If you’ll sit down, I’ll bear your logs the while.
Pray, give me that.
I’ll carry it to the pile.
It would become me As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it And yours it is against.
Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it.
You look wearily.
No, noble mistress.
'Tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night.
I do beseech you  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers  What is your name?
Miranda.
O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration, worth What’s dearest to th' world!
I do not know One of my sex, no woman’s face remember  Save, from my glass, mine own.
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father.
Do you love me?
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.
Fair encounter Of two most rare affections!
Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between 'em!
Wherefore weep you?
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.
My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.
My husband, then?
Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom.
Here’s my hand.
And mine, with my heart in ’t.
And now farewell Till half an hour hence.
A thousand thousand!
Tell not me.
When the butt is out, we will drink water.
“Servant monster?” The folly of this island.
They say there’s but five upon this isle.
We are three of them.
If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.
Where should they be set else?
He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
Your lieutenant, if you list.
We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Nor go neither.
But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good mooncalf.
How does thy honor?
Let me lick thy shoe.
I’ll not serve him.
He’s not valiant.
Thou liest, most ignorant monster.
I am in case to justle a constable.
Why, thou deboshed fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today?
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?
Lo, how he mocks me!
Wilt thou let him, my lord?
“Lord,” quoth he?
That a monster should be such a natural!
Lo, lo, again!
Bite him to death, I prithee.
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree.
The poor monster’s my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
Marry, will I.   Kneel and repeat it.
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
Thou liest.
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou!
I would my valiant master would destroy thee.
I do not lie.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
Why, I said nothing.
Mum, then, and no more.
Proceed.
I say, by sorcery he got this isle.
From me he got it.
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him for I know thou darest, But this thing dare not
That’s most certain.
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to th' party?
Yea, yea, my lord.
I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
Thou liest.
Thou canst not.
What a pied ninny’s this!
Thou scurvy patch!
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him.
When that’s gone, He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are.
Trinculo, run into no further danger.
Why, what did I?
I did nothing.
I’ll go farther off.
Didst thou not say he lied?
Thou liest.
Do I so?
Take thou that.
As you like this, give me the lie another time.
I did not give the lie.
Out o' your wits and hearing too?
A pox o' your bottle!
This can sack and drinking do.
A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
Ha, ha, ha!
Now, forward with your tale.
Prithee, stand farther off.
Beat him enough.
After a little time, I’ll beat him too.
Stand farther.
Come, proceed.
Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep.
Is it so brave a lass?
Ay, lord.
Monster, I will kill this man.
His daughter and I will be king and queen save our graces!
and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?
Excellent.
Give me thy hand.
I am sorry I beat thee.
But while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
Within this half hour will he be asleep.
Wilt thou destroy him then?
Ay, on mine honor.
This will I tell my master.
Thou makest me merry.
I am full of pleasure.
Let us be jocund.
Will you troll the catch You taught me but whilere?
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
That’s not the tune.
What is this same?
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness.
If thou beest a devil, take ’t as thou list.
O, forgive me my sins!
He that dies pays all debts.
I defy thee!
Mercy upon us!
Art thou afeard?
No, monster, not I.
Be not afeard.
The isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again.
And then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked I cried to dream again.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.
That shall be by and by.
I remember the story.
The sound is going away.
Let’s follow it, and after do our work.
Lead, monster; we’ll follow.
I would I could see this taborer.
He lays it on.
Wilt come?
I’ll follow, Stephano.
By 'r lakin, I can go no further, sir.
My old bones ache.
Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits.
Sit down and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer.
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.
I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose That you resolved t' effect.
The next advantage Will we take throughly.
Let it be tonight, For now they are oppressed with travel.
They Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance As when they are fresh.
I say, tonight.
No more.
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!
Marvelous sweet music!
Give us kind keepers, heavens!
What were these?
A living drollery.
Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.
If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders  For, certes, these are people of the island  Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note, Their manners are more gentle kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many nay, almost any.
Honest lord, Thou hast said well, for some of you there present Are worse than devils.
I cannot too much muse Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing, Although they want the use of tongue, a kind Of excellent dumb discourse.
They vanished strangely.
No matter, since They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.
Will ’t please you taste of what is here?
Not I.
Faith, sir, you need not fear.
When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em Wallets of flesh, or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts?
which now we find Each putter out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of.
I will stand to and feed, Although my last.
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Performed, my Ariel.
A grace it had, devouring.
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say.
So with good life And observation strange, my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done.
My high charms work And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions.
They now are in my power, And in these fits I leave them while I visit Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned, And his and mine loved darling.
I' th' name of something holy, sir, why stand you In this strange stare?
Oh, it is monstrous, monstrous.
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it, The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper.
But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o'er.
I’ll be thy second.
All three of them are desperate.
Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
Follow, I pray you.
I do believe it Against an oracle.
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter.
Fairly spoke.
Sit then and talk with her.
She is thine own.
What, Ariel!
My industrious servant, Ariel!
What would my potent master?
Here I am.
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick.
Presently?
Ay, with a twink.
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice and cry “So, so!
” Each one, tripping on his toe, Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master, no?
Dearly my delicate Ariel.
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.
Well, I conceive.
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.
Well.
Now come, my Ariel!
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
A contract of true love to celebrate, And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers.
Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen?
Of her society Be not afraid.
Highest queen of state, Great Juno, comes.
I know her by her gait.
Honor, riches, marriage, blessing, Long continuance, and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you.
Juno sings her blessings on you.
Earth’s increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty, Vines and clustering bunches growing, Plants with goodly burden bowing  Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest.
Scarcity and want shall shun you.
Ceres' blessing so is on you.
This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly.
May I be bold To think these spirits?
Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies.
Let me live here ever.
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise.
Sweet now, silence.
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.
There’s something else to do.
Hush and be mute, Or else our spell is marred.
I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life.
The minute of their plot Is almost come.
Well done.
Avoid, no more!
This is strange.
Your father’s in some passion That works him strongly.
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered.
You do look, my son, in a moved sort, As if you were dismayed.
Be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended.
These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air.
And like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind.
We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.
Sir, I am vexed.
Bear with my weakness.
My old brain is troubled.
Come with a thought.
I thank thee, Ariel.
Come.
Thy thoughts I cleave to.
What’s thy pleasure?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Ay, my commander.
When I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared Lest I might anger thee.
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
I told you, sir, they were red hot with drinking, So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project.
This was well done, my bird.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.
I go, I go.
Come, hang them on this line.
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall.
We now are near his cell.
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the jack with us.
Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.
So is mine.
Do you hear, monster?
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you
Thou wert but a lost monster.
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance.
Therefore speak softly.
All’s hushed as midnight yet.
There is not only disgrace and dishonor in that, monster, but an infinite loss.
That’s more to me than my wetting.
Yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.
Prithee, my king, be quiet.
Seest thou here, This is the mouth o' th' cell.
No noise, and enter.
Give me thy hand.
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
O King Stephano!
O peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Let it alone, thou fool.
It is but trash.
Oh, ho, monster, we know what belongs to a frippery.
O King Stephano!
Put off that gown, Trinculo.
Thy grace shall have it.
The dropsy drown this fool!
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage?
Let’s alone, And do the murder first.
If he awake, From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.
Be you quiet, monster.
Mistress line, is not this my jerkin?
Now is the jerkin under the line.
Do, do.
We steal by line and level, an ’t like your grace.
I thank thee for that jest.
Here’s a garment for ’t.
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.
“Steal by line and level” is an excellent pass of pate.
There’s another garment for ’t.
I will have none on ’t.
We shall lose our time, And all be turned to barnacles or to apes With foreheads villainous low.
Monster, lay to your fingers.
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom.
Go to, carry this.
And this.
Ay, and this.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Silver.
There it goes, Silver!
Fury, Fury!
There, Tyrant, there.
Hark, hark!
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps, and more pinch spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Hark, they roar.
Let them be hunted soundly.
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies.
Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom.
Now does my project gather to a head.
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time Goes upright with his carriage.
How’s the day?
On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.
I did say so When first I raised the tempest.
Say, my spirit, How fares the king and ’s followers?
Dost thou think so, spirit?
Mine would, sir, were I human.
And mine shall.
I’ll fetch them, sir.
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, Now useless, boiled within thy skull.
There stand, For you are spell stopped.
Where the bee sucks, there suck I.
In a cowslip’s bell I lie.
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat’s back I do fly After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel.
I shall miss thee, But yet thou shalt have freedom.
So, so, so.
To the king’s ship, invisible as thou art.
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches.
I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat.
All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement Inhabits here.
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!
Behold, sir King, The wrongèd Duke of Milan, Prospero.
For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body.
And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome.
Whe'er thou beest he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, As late I have been, I not know.
Thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood.
And since I saw thee, Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which I fear a madness held me.
This must crave  An if this be at all a most strange story.
First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot
Whether this be Or be not, I’ll not swear.
You do yet taste Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you Believe things certain.
Welcome, my friends all.
The devil speaks in him.
No.
If thou beest Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation, How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost  How sharp the point of this remembrance is!
My dear son Ferdinand.
I am woe for ’t, sir.
I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content.
You the like loss?
As great to me as late.
And, supportable To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.
A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there!
That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies.
When did you lose your daughter?
In this last tempest.
Sweet lord, you play me false.
No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.
If this prove A vision of the Island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.
A most high miracle!
Now all the blessings Of a glad father, compass thee about.
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Oh, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!
O brave new world, That has such people in ’t!
'Tis new to thee.
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.
Is she the goddess that hath severed us And brought us thus together?
Sir, she is mortal.
But by immortal providence, she’s mine.
I am hers.
But oh, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!
There, sir, stop.
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone.
I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this.
Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessèd crown, For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither.
I say, amen, Gonzalo.
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples?
O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars.
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis; And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves When no man was his own.
Give me your hands.
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy.
Be it so.
Amen.
Oh, look, sir, look, sir!
Here is more of us.
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company.
Sir, all this service Have I done since I went.
My tricksy spirit!
These are not natural events.
They strengthen From strange to stranger.
Say, how came you hither?
If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I’d strive to tell you.
Was ’t well done?
Bravely, my diligence.
Thou shalt be free.
Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business.
At picked leisure Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you  Which to you shall seem probable of every These happened accidents.
Till when, be cheerful And think of each thing well.
Come hither, spirit.
Set Caliban and his companions free.
Untie the spell.
How fares my gracious sir?
Every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.
Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio!
If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is!
I am afraid He will chastise me.
Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy 'em?
Very like.
One of them Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true.
I shall be pinched to death.
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
He is drunk now.
Where had he wine?
And Trinculo is reeling ripe.
Where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How camest thou in this pickle?
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones.
Why, how now, Stephano?
O, touch me not.
I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
You’d be king o' th' isle, sirrah?
I should have been a sore one then.
This is a strange thing as e'er I looked on.
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape.
Go, sirrah, to my cell.
Take with you your companions.
As you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
Ay, that I will.
And I’ll be wise hereafter And seek for grace.
What a thrice double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool!
Go to, away.
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
Or stole it, rather.
I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely.
Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have’s mine own, Which is most faint.
Now, ’tis true, I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples.
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus: Home keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Wilt thou be gone?
Sweet Valentine, adieu!
And on a love book pray for my success?
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
That's on some shallow story of deep love: How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
That's a deep story of a deeper love: For he was more than over shoes in love.
Over the boots?
Nay, give me not the boots.
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
What?
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells, so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
As much to you at home!
And so, farewell.
Sir Proteus, save you!
Saw you my master?
But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already, And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray, An if the shepherd be a while away.
You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, and I a sheep?
I do.
Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
This proves me still a sheep.
True; and thy master a shepherd.
Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.  '
But, dost thou hear?
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
You mistake; I mean the pound,  a pinfold.
From a pound to a pin?
Fold it over and over, 'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
But what said she?
Ay.
Nod  Ay  why, that's noddy.
And that set together is noddy.
Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
Why sir, how do you bear with me?
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.
Well, sir, here is for your pains.
What said she?
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
What said she?
Nothing?
No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.  '
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone, Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me, In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
Lord, Lord!
To see what folly reigns in us!
How now!
What means this passion at his name?
Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
Your reason?
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
His little speaking shows his love but small.
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
They do not love that do not show their love.
O, they love least that let men know their love.
I would I knew his mind.
Peruse this paper, madam.
'To Julia.  '
Say, from whom?
That the contents will show.
Say, say, who gave it thee?
Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place.
Or else return no more into my sight.
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
Will ye be gone?
That you may ruminate.
What would your ladyship?
Is't near dinner time?
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
Nothing.
Why didst thou stoop, then?
To take a paper up that I let fall.
And is that paper nothing?
Nothing concerning me.
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns Unless it have a false interpeter.
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.  '
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
Heavy!
Belike it hath some burden then?
And why not you?
I cannot reach so high.
Let's see your song.
How now, minion!
You do not?
No, madam; it is too sharp.
You, minion, are too saucy.
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
Madam, Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
Well, let us go.
If you respect them, best to take them up.
I see you have a month's mind to them.
Come, come; will't please you go?
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
Why, what of him?
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion, youthful Valentine, Attends the emperor in his royal court.
I know it well.
Sweet love!
Sweet lines!
Sweet life!
How now!
What letter are you reading there?
May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine, Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
And how stand you affected to his wish?
As one relying on your lordship's will And not depending on his friendly wish.
My will is something sorted with his wish.
Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee: No more of stay!
To morrow thou must go.
Sir, your glove.
Not mine; my gloves are on.
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
Ha!
Madam Silvia!
Madam Silvia!
How now, sirrah?
She is not within hearing, sir.
Why, sir, who bade you call her?
Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
Well, you'll still be too forward.
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
She that your worship loves?
Why, how know you that I am in love?
Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a school boy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas.
Are all these things perceived in me?
They are all perceived without ye.
Without me?
They cannot.
Without you?
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
Hast thou observed that?
Even she, I mean.
Why, sir, I know her not.
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not?
Is she not hard favoured, sir?
Not so fair, boy, as well favoured.
Sir, I know that well enough.
What dost thou know?
That she is not so fair as, of you, well favoured.
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
That's because the one is painted and the other out of all count.
How painted?
And how out of count?
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.
How esteemest thou me?
I account of her beauty.
You never saw her since she was deformed.
How long hath she been deformed?
Ever since you loved her.
I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I see her beautiful.
If you love her, you cannot see her.
Why?
Because Love is blind.
What should I see then?
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.
And have you?
I have.
Are they not lamely writ?
No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
Peace!
Here she comes.
O excellent motion!
O exceeding puppet!
Now will he interpret to her.
Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
O, give ye good even!
Here's a million of manners.
Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
A pretty period!
And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.  '
What means your ladyship?
Do you not like it?
Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ; But since unwillingly, take them again.
Nay, take them.
Madam, they are for you.
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
If it please me, madam, what then?
Why, if it please you, take it for your labour: And so, good morrow, servant.
How now, sir?
What are you reasoning with yourself?
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
To do what?
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
To whom?
What figure?
By a letter, I should say.
Why, she hath not writ to me?
What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
Why, do you not perceive the jest?
No, believe me.
No believing you, indeed, sir.
But did you perceive her earnest?
She gave me none, except an angry word.
Why, she hath given you a letter.
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
I would it were no worse.
I have dined.
Have patience, gentle Julia.
I must, where is no remedy.
When possibly I can, I will return.
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
What, gone without a word?
Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
Go; I come, I come.
Alas!
This parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
Launce, away, away, aboard!
It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
What's the unkindest tide?
Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
Where should I lose my tongue?
In thy tale.
In thy tail!
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the tied!
Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
Sir, call me what thou darest.
Wilt thou go?
Well, I will go.
Servant!
Mistress?
Master, Sir Turio frowns on you.
Ay, boy, it's for love.
Not of you.
Of my mistress, then.
'Twere good you knocked him.
Servant, you are sad.
Indeed, madam, I seem so.
Seem you that you are not?
Haply I do.
So do counterfeits.
So do you.
What seem I that I am not?
Wise.
What instance of the contrary?
Your folly.
And how quote you my folly?
I quote it in your jerkin.
My jerkin is a doublet.
Well, then, I'll double your folly.
How?
What, angry, Sir Turio!
Do you change colour?
Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air.
You have said, sir.
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
Who is that, servant?
Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire.
Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.
No more, gentlemen, no more:  here comes my father.
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
My lord, I will be thankful.
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
Hath he not a son?
You know him well?
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
Welcome him then according to his worth.
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them Upon some other pawn for fealty.
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
To see such lovers, Turio, as yourself: Upon a homely object Love can wink.
Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
Welcome, dear Proteus!
Mistress, I beseech you, Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither, If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
That you are welcome?
That you are worthless.
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
I wait upon his pleasure.
Come, Sir Turio, Go with me.
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
Your friends are well and have them much commended.
And how do yours?
I left them all in health.
How does your lady?
And how thrives your love?
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Was this the idol that you worship so?
No; but she is an earthly paragon.
Call her divine.
I will not flatter her.
O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
Except my mistress.
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
Then let her alone.
But she loves you?
Will you make haste?
I will.
Lance!
By mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome.
Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.
But shall she marry him?
No.
How then?
Shall he marry her?
No, neither.
What, are they broken?
No, they are both as whole as a fish.
Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her.
What an ass art thou!
I understand thee not.
What a block art thou, that thou canst not!
My staff understands me.
What thou sayest?
It stands under thee, indeed.
Why, stand under and under stand is all one.
But tell me true, will't be a match?
Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will!
The conclusion is then that it will.
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
It's good that I get it now.
Than how?
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself in love.
Why?
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian.
Wilt thou go?
At thy service.
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
Pity the dearth that I have pined in, By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love, Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire, But qualify the fire's extreme rage, Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
But in what habit will you go along?
Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord, What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
Out, out, Lucetta!
That would be ill favour'd.
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin, Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
Nay, that I will not.
Then never dream on infamy, but go.
If Proteus like your journey when you come, No matter who's displeased when you are gone: I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
All these are servants to deceitful men.
Base men, that use them to so base effect!
Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
Sir Turio, give us leave, I pray, awhile; We have some secrets to confer about.
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
Upon mine honour, he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this.
Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
Be they of much import?
The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court.
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
What lets but one may enter at her window?
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood, Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
When would you use it?
Pray, sir, tell me that.
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
Ay, my good lord.
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same?
What's here?
'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
And why not death rather than living torment?
Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
Soho, soho!
What seest thou?
Valentine?
No.
Who then?
His spirit?
Neither.
What then?
Nothing.
Can nothing speak?
Master, shall I strike?
Who wouldst thou strike?
Nothing.
Villain, forbear.
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,
Sirrah, I say, forbear.
Friend Valentine, a word.
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news, So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine, For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
Is Silvia dead?
No, Valentine.
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
Hath she forsworn me?
No, Valentine.
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
What is your news?
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
That thou art banished  O, that's the news!
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
O, I have fed upon this woe already, And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
I pray thee, Lance, an if thou seest my boy, Bid him make haste and meet me at the North gate.
Go, sirrah, find him out.
Come, Valentine.
O my dear Silvia!
Hapless Valentine!
Here is the cate log of her condition.
'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.  '
How now, Signior Lance!
What news with your mastership?
With my master's ship?
Why, it is at sea.
Well, your old vice still; mistake the word.
What news, then, in your paper?
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
Why, man, how black?
Why, as black as ink.
Let me read them.
Fie on thee, jolt head!
Thou canst not read.
Thou liest; I can.
I will try thee.
Tell me this: who begot thee?
Marry, the son of my grandfather.
O illiterate loiterer!
Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
There; and St.   Nicholas be thy speed!
'Imprimis: She can milk.  '
Ay, that she can.
'Item: She brews good ale.  '
And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.  '
'Item: She can sew.  '
That's as much as to say, 'Can she so?'
'Item: She can knit.  '
What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?
'Item: She can wash and scour.  '
A special virtue: for then she need not be washed and scoured.
'Item: She can spin.  '
Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living.
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.  '
That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that, indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
'Here follow her vices.  '
Close at the heels of her virtues.
'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath.  '
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.
Read on.
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.  '
That makes amends for her sour breath.
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.  '
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
'Item: She is slow in words.  '
O villain, that set this down among her vices!
'Item: She is proud.  '
'Item: She hath no teeth.  '
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
'Item: She is curst.  '
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.  '
'Item: She is too liberal.  '
'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.  '
'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'
More hair than wit?
It may be; I'll prove it.
'And more faults than hairs,'
That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
'And more wealth than faults.  '
Why, that word makes the faults gracious.
Well, I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible,
What then?
Why, then will I tell thee  that thy master stays for thee at the North gate.
For me?
For you!
Sir Turio, don't be worried!
She will love you now that Valentine is banished and out of her sight.
This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
How now, Sir Proteus!
Is your countryman According to our proclamation gone?
Gone, my good lord.
My daughter takes his going grievously.
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
So I believe; but Turio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee   For thou hast shown some sign of good desert   Makes me the better to confer with thee.
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace Let me not live to look upon your grace.
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine and love Sir Turio?
The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent, Three things that women highly hold in hate.
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
Then you must undertake to slander him.
Ay, Much is the force of heaven bred poesy.
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction giver, Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice.
About it, gentlemen!
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper, And afterward determine our proceedings.
Even now about it!
I will pardon you.
Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
My friends,
That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
Peace!
We'll hear him.
Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
Whither travel you?
To Verona.
Whence came you?
From Milan.
Have you long sojourned there?
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd, If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
What, were you banish'd thence?
I was.
For what offence?
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
Have you the tongues?
My youthful travel therein made me happy, Or else I often had been miserable.
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
We'll have him.
Sirs, a word.
Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
Peace, villain!
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
Nothing but my fortune.
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman, Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
What say'st thou?
Wilt thou be of our consort?
But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
I take your offer and will live with you, Provided that you do no outrages On silly women or poor passengers.
No, we detest such vile base practises.
Already have I been false to Valentine And now I must be as unjust to Turio.
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
Who?
Silvia?
Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
I thank you for your own.
Now, gentlemen, Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I pray you, why is it?
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
But shall I hear him speak?
Ay, that you shall.
That will be music.
Hark, hark!
Is he among these?
Ay: but, peace!
Let's hear 'em.
How now!
Are you sadder than you were before?
How do you, man?
The music likes you not.
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
Why, my pretty youth?
He plays false, father.
How?
You have a quick ear.
I perceive you delight not in music.
Not a whit, when it jars so.
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
Ay, that change is the spite.
You would have them always play but one thing?
I would always have one play but one thing.
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
Where is Lance?
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
Peace!
Stand aside: the company parts.
Where meet we?
At Saint Gregory's well.
Farewell.
Madam, good even to your ladyship.
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth, You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
What's your will?
That I may compass yours.
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
He heard not that.
If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it, And make it but a shadow, as I am.
As wretches have o'ernight That wait for execution in the morn.
Host, will you go?
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
Marry, at my house.
Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
Who calls?
Your servant and your friend; One that attends your ladyship's command.
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
This evening coming.
Where shall I meet you?
At Friar Patrick's cell, Where I intend holy confession.
I will not fail your ladyship.
Good morrow, gentle lady.
Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
Sebastian is thy name?
I like thee well And will employ thee in some service presently.
In what you please: I'll do what I can.
I hope thou wilt.
How now, you whoreson peasant!
Where have you been these two days loitering?
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
And what says she to my little jewel?
But she received my dog?
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
She is dead, belike?
Not so; I think she lives.
Alas!
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
I cannot choose But pity her.
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
Well, give her that ring and therewithal This letter.
That's her chamber.
Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber, Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
How many women would do such a message?
Alas, poor Proteus!
Thou hast entertain'd A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas, poor fool!
Why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me?
Gentlewoman, good day!
I pray you, be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
What would you with her, if that I be she?
If you be she, I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
From whom?
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
O, he sends you for a picture.
Ay, madam.
Ursula, bring my picture here.
Madam, please you peruse this letter.
I pray thee, let me look on that again.
It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
There, hold!
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
The more shame for him that he sends it me; For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring, Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
She thanks you.
What say'st thou?
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Poor gentlewoman!
My master wrongs her much.
Dost thou know her?
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
Is she not passing fair?
How tall was she?
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
Lady, a happy evening!
Amen, amen!
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
O, sir, I find her milder than she was; And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
What, that my leg is too long?
No; that it is too little.
I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
What says she to my face?
She says it is a fair one.
How likes she my discourse?
Ill, when you talk of war.
But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
What says she to my valour?
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
What says she to my birth?
That you are well derived.
True; from a gentleman to a fool.
O, ay; and pities them.
Wherefore?
That such an ass should owe them.
That they are out by lease.
Here comes the duke.
How now, Sir Proteus!
How now, Turio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
Not I.
Nor I.
Saw you my daughter?
Neither.
Why then, She's fled unto that peasant Valentine; And Eglamour is in her company.
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl, That flies her fortune when it follows her.
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
And I will follow, more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
Come, come, Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
A thousand more mischances than this one Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Come, bring her away.
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Being nimble footed, he hath outrun us, But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
How like a dream is this I see and hear!
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
O miserable, unhappy that I am!
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
Had I been seized by a hungry lion, I would have been a breakfast to the beast, Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
What dangerous action, stood it next to death, Would I not undergo for one calm look!
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved, When women cannot love where they're beloved!
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
In love Who respects friend?
All men but Proteus.
O heaven!
I'll force thee yield to my desire.
Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch, Thou friend of an ill fashion!
Valentine!
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love, For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
My shame and guilt confounds me.
O me unhappy!
Look to the boy.
Why, boy!
Why, wag!
How now!
What's the matter?
Where is that ring, boy?
Here 'tis; this is it.
How!
Let me see: Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
But how camest thou by this ring?
At my depart I gave this unto Julia.
How!
Julia!
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths, And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
Than men their minds!
'Tis true.
O heaven!
Were man But constant, he were perfect.
Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
And I mine.
A prize, a prize, a prize!
Forbear, forbear, I say!
It is my lord the duke.
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced, Banished Valentine.
Sir Valentine!
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
The more degenerate and base art thou, To make such means for her as thou hast done And leave her on such slight conditions.
I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
What think you of this page, my lord?
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
What mean you by that saying?
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along, That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves; for indeed
Beseech you
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence in so rare I know not what to say.
We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it.
Would they else be content to die?
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.
If the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.
Sir, that's to morrow.
We are tougher, brother, Than you can put us to't.
No longer stay.
One seven night longer.
Very sooth, to morrow.
We'll part the time between's then; and in that I'll no gainsaying.
Press me not, beseech you, so.
Tongue tied, our queen?
speak you.
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until You have drawn oaths from him not to stay.
You, sir, Charge him too coldly.
Well said, Hermione.
No, madam.
Nay, but you will?
I may not, verily.
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I, Though you would seek t'unsphere the stars with oaths, Should yet say 'Sir, no going.  '
Not your gaoler, then, But your kind hostess.
Come, I'll question you Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys: You were pretty lordings then?
Was not my lord The verier wag o' the two?
By this we gather You have tripp'd since.
O my most sacred lady!
Grace to boot!
Is he won yet?
He'll stay my lord.
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest To better purpose.
Never?
Never, but once.
What!
have I twice said well?
when was't before?
'Tis grace indeed.
Too hot, too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
Ay, my good lord.
I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock.
What, hast smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine.
Yes, if you will, my lord.
What means Sicilia?
He something seems unsettled.
How, my lord!
What cheer?
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly, Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms!
No, my lord, I'll fight.
You will!
why, happy man be's dole!
My brother, Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours?
If you would seek us, We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
I am like you, they say.
Why that's some comfort.
What, Camillo there?
Ay, my good lord.
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
Didst note it?
He would not stay at your petitions: made His business more material.
Didst perceive it?
At the good queen's entreaty.
Business, my lord!
I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer.
Ha!
Stays here longer.
Ay, but why?
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress.
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress!
satisfy!
Let that suffice.
Be it forbid, my lord!
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek?
is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip?
stopping the career Of laughing with a sigh?
a note infallible Of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners?
Good my lord, be cured Of this diseased opinion, and betimes; For 'tis most dangerous.
Say it be, 'tis true.
No, no, my lord.
Who does infect her?
Make that thy question, and go rot!
My lord, Go then; and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia And with your queen.
I'll do't, my lord.
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
O miserable lady!
But, for me, What case stand I in?
This is strange: methinks My favour here begins to warp.
Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.
Hail, most royal sir!
What is the news i' the court?
None rare, my lord.
I dare not know, my lord.
How!
How!
caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk: I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better By my regard, but kill'd none so.
I may not answer.
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd.
On, good Camillo.
I am appointed him to murder you.
By whom, Camillo?
By the king.
For what?
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, As he had seen't or been an instrument To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen Forbiddenly.
O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly and my name Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
How should this grow?
I do believe thee: I saw his heart in 's face.
Give me thy hand: Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine.
My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago.
This jealousy Is for a precious creature: as she's rare, Must it be great, and as his person's mighty, Must it be violent, and as he does conceive He is dishonour'd by a man which ever Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns: please your highness To take the urgent hour.
Come, sir, away.
Come, my gracious lord, Shall I be your playfellow?
No, I'll none of you.
Why, my sweet lord?
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if I were a baby still.
I love you better.
And why so, my lord?
Who taught you this?
I learnt it out of women's faces.
Pray now What colour are your eyebrows?
Blue, my lord.
She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
What wisdom stirs amongst you?
Merry or sad shall't be?
As merry as you will.
Let's have that, good sir.
There was a man
Nay, come, sit down; then on.
Come on, then, And give't me in mine ear.
Was he met there?
his train?
Camillo with him?
How blest am I In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge!
how accursed In being so blest!
By his great authority; Which often hath no less prevail'd than so On your command.
I know't too well.
What is this?
But I'ld say he had not, And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying, Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
Should a villain say so, The most replenish'd villain in the world, He were as much more villain: you, my lord, Do but mistake.
You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this.
How will this grieve you, When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
Shall I be heard?
Who is't that goes with me?
Beseech your highness, My women may be with me; for you see My plight requires it.
Go, do our bidding; hence!
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
Hold your peaces.
Good my lord,
Cease; no more.
What!
And I wish, my liege, You had only in your silent judgment tried it, Without more overture.
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age, Or thou wert born a fool.
Well done, my lord.
Though I am satisfied and need no more Than what I know, yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others, such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to the truth.
So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confined, Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform.
To laughter, as I take it, If the good truth were known.
For a worthy lady And one whom much I honour.
Pray you then, Conduct me to the queen.
I may not, madam: To the contrary I have express commandment.
GAOLER    I can't, ma'am.
I have orders to do exactly the opposite.
Well, isn't that something: locking up an innocent woman and keeping her from friendly visitors.
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain As passes colouring.
Dear gentlewoman, How fares our gracious lady?
A boy?
I dare be sworn These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!
Tell her, Emilia.
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you, come something nearer.
I do believe it.
My lord?
How does the boy?
To see his nobleness!
You must not enter.
That's enough.
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded None should come at him.
Not so hot, good sir: I come to bring him sleep.
What noise there, ho?
No noise, my lord; but needful conference About some gossips for your highness.
How!
Away with that audacious lady!
Antigonus, I charged thee that she should not come about me: I knew she would.
I told her so, my lord, On your displeasure's peril and on mine, She should not visit you.
What, canst not rule her?
Good queen!
A nest of traitors!
I am none, by this good light.
It is yours; And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, So like you, 'tis the worse.
Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself Hardly one subject.
Once more, take her hence.
A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more.
I'll ha' thee burnt.
On your allegiance, Out of the chamber with her!
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: Jove send her A better guiding spirit!
What needs these hands?
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child?
away with't!
You're liars all.
I am a feather for each wind that blows: Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father?
It shall be possible.
Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding.
I will, my lord.
Mark and perform it, see'st thou!
I swear to do this, though a present death Had been more merciful.
No, I'll not rear Another's issue.
So please you, sir, their speed Hath been beyond account.
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet, Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing The common praise it bears.
I shall report, For most it caught me, the celestial habits, Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence Of the grave wearers.
If the event o' the journey Prove as successful to the queen, O be't so!
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy, The time is worth the use on't.
Great Apollo Turn all to the best!
These proclamations, So forcing faults upon Hermione, I little like.
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court.
Silence!
Read the indictment.
That's true enough; Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
You will not own it.
You knew of his departure, as you know What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
All this we swear.
Break up the seals and read.
Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not found.
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
Praised!
Hast thou read truth?
My lord the king, the king!
What is the business?
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear Of the queen's speed, is gone.
How!
Is dead.
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, Break too.
What fit is this, good lady?
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels?
racks?
fires?
The higher powers forbid!
I say she's dead; I'll swear't.
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon The deserts of Bohemia?
Their sacred wills be done!
Go, get aboard; Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before I call upon thee.
Go on; I'll be right behind you.
Hilloa, loa!
What're you doing up here?
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
I would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
Heavy matters!
heavy matters!
but look thee here, boy.
Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things dying, I with things newborn.
Here's a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire's child!
look thee here; take up, take up, boy; open't.
So, let's see: it was told me I should be rich by the fairies.
This is some changeling: open't.
What's within, boy?
Go you the next way with your findings.
That's a good deed.
If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the sight of him.
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, Now take upon me, in the name of Time, To use my wings.
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince.
What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I have missingly noted, he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither.
I willingly obey your command.
My best Camillo!
We must disguise ourselves.
When daffodils begin to peer, With heigh!
the doxy over the dale, Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year; For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, With heigh!
the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra lyra chants, With heigh!
with heigh!
If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
I cannot do't without counters.
Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep shearing feast?
O that ever I was born!
I' the name of me
O, help me, help me!
pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!
Alack, poor soul!
thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather than have these off.
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.
Alas, poor man!
a million of beating may come to a great matter.
What, by a horseman, or a footman?
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
O, good sir, tenderly, O!
Alas, poor soul!
O, good sir, softly, good sir!
I fear, sir, my shoulder blade is out.
How now!
canst stand?
Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly.
You ha' done me a charitable office.
Dost lack any money?
I have a little money for thee.
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
Vices, I would say, sir.
Out upon him!
How do you now?
Shall I bring thee on the way?
No, good faced sir; no, sweet sir.
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
Sir, my gracious lord, To chide at your extremes it not becomes me: O, pardon, that I name them!
I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father's ground.
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness Hath not been used to fear.
Even now I tremble To think your father, by some accident, Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
O lady Fortune, Stand you auspicious!
Fie, daughter!
Wherefore, gentle maiden, Do you neglect them?
For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares With great creating nature.
Say there be; Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean: so, over that art Which you say adds to nature, is an art That nature makes.
So it is.
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, And do not call them bastards.
Out, alas!
What, like a corse?
What you do Still betters what is done.
I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to't.
I'll swear for 'em.
Come on, strike up!
Now, in good time!
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter?
She dances featly.
He could never come better; he shall come in.
This is a brave fellow.
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow.
Has he any unbraided wares?
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in's tunes.
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them than you'ld think, sister.
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
I was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
Is there no manners left among maids?
will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces?
Is there not milking time, when you are going to bed, or kiln hole, to whistle off these secrets, but you must be tittle tattling before all our guests?
I have done.
Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves.
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money?
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to be wary.
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
What hast here?
ballads?
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed.
Is it true, think you?
Very true, and but a month old.
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Pray you now, buy it.
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
Is it true too, think you?
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold.
Lay it by too: another.
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
Let's have some merry ones.
We had the tune on't a month ago.
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my occupation; have at it with you.
Get you hence, for I must go Where it fits not you to know.
Whither?
O, whither?
Whither?
It becomes thy oath full well, Thou to me thy secrets tell.
Me too, let me go thither.
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
If to either, thou dost ill.
Neither.
What, neither?
Neither.
Thou hast sworn my love to be.
Thou hast sworn it more to me: Then whither goest?
say, whither?
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape, Or lace for your cape, My dainty duck, my dear a?
Any silk, any thread, Any toys for your head, Of the new'st and finest, finest wear a?
Come to the pedlar; Money's a medler.
Away!
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see these four threes of herdsmen.
Why, they stay at door, sir.
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before!
I have put you out: But to your protestation; let me hear What you profess.
Do, and be witness to 't.
And this my neighbour too?
Fairly offer'd.
This shows a sound affection.
But, my daughter, Say you the like to him?
I cannot speak So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his.
Take hands, a bargain!
O, that must be I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, I shall have more than you can dream of yet; Enough then for your wonder.
But, come on, Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
Come, your hand; And, daughter, yours.
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; Have you a father?
I have: but what of him?
Knows he of this?
He neither does nor shall.
Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table.
Pray you once more, Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs?
is he not stupid With age and altering rheums?
can he speak?
hear?
Know man from man?
dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed rid?
and again does nothing But what he did being childish?
Let him know't.
He shall not.
Prithee, let him.
No, he must not.
Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.
O, my heart!
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made More homely than thy state.
Even here undone!
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.
I cannot speak, nor think Nor dare to know that which I know.
Why look you so upon me?
I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?
Even he, my lord.
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last But till 'twere known!
Be advised.
This is desperate, sir.
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow; I needs must think it honesty.
Hark, Perdita  I'll hear you by and by.
He's irremoveable, Resolved for flight.
Now, good Camillo; I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony.
Sir, I think You have heard of my poor services, i' the love That I have borne your father?
How, Camillo, May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man And after that trust to thee.
Have you thought on A place whereto you'll go?
Worthy Camillo, What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him?
Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts.
I am bound to you: There is some sap in this.
Yea, say you so?
My good Camillo, She is as forward of her breeding as She is i' the rear our birth.
I cannot say 'tis pity She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress To most that teach.
Your pardon, sir; for this I'll blush you thanks.
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon!
Camillo, Preserver of my father, now of me, The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
Ha, ha!
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes
Shall satisfy your father.
Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.
Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit Nothing may give us aid.
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
How now, good fellow!
why shakest thou so?
Fear not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough.
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already.
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.
Dispatch, I prithee.
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with conscience take it.
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress, let my prophecy Come home to ye!
I see the play so lies That I must bear a part.
No remedy.
Have you done there?
Should I now meet my father, He would not call me son.
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come.
Farewell, my friend.
Adieu, sir.
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea side.
The swifter speed the better.
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
Nay, but hear me.
Nay, but hear me.
Go to, then.
Indeed, brother in law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
Very wisely, puppies!
I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master.
Pray heartily he be at palace.
To the palace, an it like your worship.
We are but plain fellows, sir.
A lie; you are rough and hairy.
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.
Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court odor from me?
reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt?
Thinkest thou, for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier?
I am courtier cap a pe; and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.
My business, sir, is to the king.
What advocate hast thou to him?
I know not, an't like you.
Advocate's the court word for a pheasant: say you have none.
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are, Therefore I will not disdain.
This cannot be but a great courtier.
His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.
The fardel there?
what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
Why, sir?
Think you so, sir?
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear.
an't like you, sir?
After I have done what I promised?
Ay, sir.
Well, give me the moiety.
Are you a party in this business?
Comfort, good comfort!
I will trust you.
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth.
I think so.
Kill'd!
She I kill'd!
You are one of those Would have him wed again.
There is none worthy, Respecting her that's gone.
And left them More rich for what they yielded.
Thou speak'st truth.
Had she such power, She had just cause.
She had; and would incense me To murder her I married.
I should so.
Stars, stars, And all eyes else dead coals!
Fear thou no wife; I'll have no wife, Paulina.
Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave?
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
You tempt him over much.
Unless another, As like Hermione as is her picture, Affront his eye.
Good madam,
I have done.
My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
That Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; Never till then.
What with him?
But few, And those but mean.
His princess, say you, with him?
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, That e'er the sun shone bright on.
How!
not women?
O my brother, Good gentleman!
the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me, and these thy offices, So rarely kind, are as interpreters Of my behind hand slackness.
Welcome hither, As is the spring to the earth.
Good my lord, She came from Libya.
Where the warlike Smalus, That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here!
You have a holy father,
Most noble sir, That which I shall report will bear no credit, Were not the proof so nigh.
Where's Bohemia?
Camillo has betray'd me; Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endured all weathers.
Lay't so to his charge: He's with the king your father.
Who?
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated.
You are married?
My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?
She is, When once she is my wife.
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed Will come on very slowly.
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress, Which he counts but a trifle.
I thought of her, Even in these looks I made.
But your petition Is yet unanswer'd.
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
I would most gladly know the issue of it.
No.
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of.
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open.
What became of his bark and his followers?
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
Are they returned to the court?
I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house.
Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing?
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head.
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.
You are well met, sir.
You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes?
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
And so have I, boy.
We may live, son, to shed many more.
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.
Thou wilt amend thy life?
Ay, an it like your good worship.
You may say it, but not swear it.
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?
Let boors and franklins say it, I'll swear it.
How if it be false, son?
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
I will prove so, sir, to my power.
What, sovereign sir, I did not well I meant well.
Her natural posture!
O, not by much.
So much the more our carver's excellence; Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she lived now.
As now she might have done, So much to my good comfort, as it is Now piercing to my soul.
O, thus she stood, Even with such life of majesty, warm life, As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
And give me leave, And do not say 'tis superstition, that I kneel and then implore her blessing.
O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
Indeed, my lord, If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you, for the stone is mine  I'ld not have show'd it.
Do not draw the curtain.
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy May think anon it moves.
Let be, let be.
Masterly done: The very life seems warm upon her lip.
The fixture of her eye has motion in't, As we are mock'd with art.
O sweet Paulina, Make me to think so twenty years together!
No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness.
Let't alone.
No, not these twenty years.
So long could I Stand by, a looker on.
Either forbear, Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you For more amazement.
It is required You do awake your faith.
Proceed: No foot shall stir.
Music, awake her; strike!
O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art Lawful as eating.
She embraces him.
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived, Or how stolen from the dead.
There's time enough for that; Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation.
Go together, You precious winners all; your exultation Partake to every one.
O, peace, Paulina!
Good day, sir.
I am glad you're well.
I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
It wears, sir, as it grows.
Ay, that's well known: But what particular rarity?
what strange, Which manifold record not matches?
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
O, 'tis a worthy lord.
Nay, that's most fix'd.
A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were, To an untirable and continuate goodness: He passes.
O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
And rich: here is a water, look ye.
You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication To the great lord.
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
A picture, sir.
When comes your book forth?
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let's see your piece.
'Tis a good piece.
So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
Indifferent.
Admirable: how this grace Speaks his own standing!
what a mental power This eye shoots forth!
how big imagination Moves in this lip!
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is't good?
How this lord is follow'd!
The senators of Athens: happy man!
Look, more!
You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
How shall I understand you?
I will unbolt to you.
I saw them speak together.
'Tis conceived to scope.
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks, With one man beckon'd from the rest below, Bowing his head against the sleepy mount To climb his happiness, would be well express'd In our condition.
Nay, sir, but hear me on.
Ay, marry, what of these?
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down, Not one accompanying his declining foot.
Imprison'd is he, say you?
Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt, His means most short, his creditors most strait: Your honourable letter he desires To those have shut him up; which failing, Periods his comfort.
Noble Ventidius!
Well; I am not of that feather to shake off My friend when he must need me.
Your lordship ever binds him.
All happiness to your honour!
Lord Timon, hear me speak.
Freely, good father.
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
I have so: what of him?
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
Attends he here, or no?
Lucilius!
Here, at your lordship's service.
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature, By night frequents my house.
I am a man That from my first have been inclined to thrift; And my estate deserves an heir more raised Than one which holds a trencher.
Well; what further?
The man is honest.
Does she love him?
Love you the maid?
Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
If in her marriage my consent be missing, I call the gods to witness, I will choose Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world, And dispossess her all.
How shall she be endow'd, if she be mated with an equal husband?
Three talents on the present; in future, all.
Most noble lord, Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
A piece of painting, which I do beseech Your lordship to accept.
The gods preserve ye!
What, my lord!
dispraise?
A more satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd, It would unclew me quite.
Well mock'd.
Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
He'll spare none.
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
Why dost thou call them knaves?
thou know'st them not.
Are they not Athenians?
Yes.
Then I repent not.
Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
Thou art proud, Apemantus.
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
Whither art going?
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
That's a deed thou'lt die for.
Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
The best, for the innocence.
Wrought he not well that painted it?
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's but a filthy piece of work.
You're a dog.
Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
No; I eat not lords.
An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
That's a lascivious apprehension.
So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.
What dost thou think 'tis worth?
Not worth my thinking.
How now, poet!
How now, philosopher!
Thou liest.
Art not one?
Yes.
Then I lie not.
Art not a poet?
Yes.
Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
That's not feigned; he is so.
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
What, thyself?
Ay.
Wherefore?
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
Art not thou a merchant?
Ay, Apemantus.
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
If traffic do it, the gods do it.
Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
What trumpet's that?
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse, All of companionship.
Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
Most welcome, sir!
So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves, And all this courtesy!
Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed Most hungerly on your sight.
Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time In different pleasures.
Pray you, let us in.
What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
Time to be honest.
That time serves still.
The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
Why, Apemantus?
Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.
Hang thyself!
No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy requests to thy friend.
Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!
I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.
He's opposite to humanity.
Come, shall we in, And taste Lord Timon's bounty?
he outgoes The very heart of kindness.
The noblest mind he carries That ever govern'd man.
Long may he live in fortunes!
Shall we in?
I'll keep you company.
Most honour'd Timon, It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age, And call him to long peace.
A noble spirit!
Nay, my lords,
My lord, we always have confess'd it.
Ho, ho, confess'd it!
hang'd it, have you not?
O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
Let it flow this way, my good lord.
Flow this way!
A brave fellow!
he keeps his tides well.
Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire: This and my food are equals; there's no odds: Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else?
Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
Joy had the like conception in our eyes And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
Ho, ho!
I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
Much!
What means that trump?
How now?
Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance.
Ladies!
what are their wills?
I pray, let them be admitted.
Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all That of his bounties taste!
They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance: Music, make their welcome!
You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
Hoy day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
They dance!
My lord, you take us even at the best.
'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold taking, I doubt me.
Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you: Please you to dispose yourselves.
Most thankfully, my lord.
Flavius.
My lord?
The little casket bring me hither.
Yes, my lord.
More jewels yet!
There is no crossing him in 's humour;
Where be our men?
Here, my lord, in readiness.
Our horses!
I am so far already in your gifts,
So are we all.
My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate Newly alighted, and come to visit you.
They are fairly welcome.
I beseech your honor, Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
Near!
I scarce know how.
May it please your honour, Lord Lucius, Out of his free love, hath presented to you Four milk white horses, trapp'd in silver.
I shall accept them fairly; let the presents Be worthily entertain'd.
How now!
Please you, my lord, that honourable gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company to morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds.
I'll hunt with him; and let them be received, Not without fair reward.
What will this come to?
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
O, he's the very soul of bounty!
O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.
O, none so welcome.
Ay, defiled land, my lord.
We are so virtuously bound
And so Am I to you.
So infinitely endear'd
All to you.
Lights, more lights!
The best of happiness, Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
Ready for his friends.
What a coil's here!
Serving of becks and jutting out of bums!
Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be good to thee.
Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to give regard to you.
Farewell; and come with better music.
Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
I go, sir.
I will, sir.
Go.
No care, no stop!
Good even, Varro: what, You come for money?
It is: and yours too, Isidore?
Would we were all discharged!
Here comes the lord.
So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again, My Alcibiades.
With me?
what is your will?
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
Dues!
Whence are you?
Of Athens here, my lord.
Go to my steward.
Mine honest friend, I prithee, but repair to me next morning.
Nay, good my lord,
Contain thyself, good friend.
Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on; I'll wait upon you instantly.
Do so, my friends.
See them well entertain'd.
Pray, draw near.
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
No,'tis to thyself.
Come away.
No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
Where's the fool now?
He last asked the question.
Poor rogues, and usurers' men!
bawds between gold and want!
What are we, Apemantus?
Asses.
Why?
How do you, gentlemen?
Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are.
Would we could see you at Corinth!
Good!
gramercy.
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
Why, how now, captain!
what do you in this wise company?
Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee profitably.
Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these letters: I know not which is which.
Canst not read?
No.
Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a dog's death.
Answer not; I am gone.
E'en so thou outrunnest grace.
Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon's.
Will you leave me there?
Ay; would they served us!
So would I,  as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
Are you three usurers' men?
Ay, fool.
Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave; which not withstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
That answer might have become Apemantus.
Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
Come with me, fool, come.
I do not always follow lover, elder brother and woman; sometime the philosopher.
Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
You would not hear me, At many leisures I proposed.
Go to: Perchance some single vantages you took.
Let all my land be sold.
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
You tell me true.
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood, Call me before the exactest auditors And set me on the proof.
Prithee, no more.
Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants This night englutted!
Who is not Timon's?
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
Assurance bless your thoughts!
My lord?
As you have said, my lord.
Lord Lucius and Lucullus?
Is't true?
You gods, reward them!
Go to Ventidius.
That had, give't these fellows To whom 'tis instant due.
Ne'er speak, or think, That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
I thank you, sir.
Here's my lord.
One of Lord Timon's men?
a gift, I warrant.
His health is well sir.
La, la, la, la!
'nothing doubting,' says he?
Please your lordship, here is the wine.
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.
Here's to thee.
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
Get you gone, sirrah.
Draw nearer, honest Flaminius.
Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou knowest well enough, although thou comest to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship, without security.
Is't possible the world should so much differ, And we alive that lived?
Fly, damned baseness, To him that worships thee!
May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Who, the Lord Timon?
he is my very good friend, and an honourable gentleman.
We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him.
But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
How!
I tell you, denied, my lord.
What a strange case was that!
See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see his honour.
My honoured lord,
Servilius!
you are kindly met, sir.
Fare thee well: commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.
May it please your honour, my lord hath sent
Ha!
what has he sent?
I am so much endeared to that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank him, thinkest thou?
And what has he sent now?
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous, I should not urge it half so faithfully.
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable!
how unluckily it happened, that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honoured!
Yes, sir, I shall.
I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
Do you observe this, Hostilius?
Ay, too well.
Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same piece Is every flatterer's spirit.
Who can call him His friend that dips in the same dish?
Religion groans at it.
Must he needs trouble me in 't,  hum!
My lord, They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for They have all denied him.
How!
have they denied him?
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
Excellent!
The like to you kind Varro.
Lucius!
What, do we meet together?
So is theirs and ours.
Lucius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!
Good day at once.
Labouring for nine.
Is not my lord seen yet?
I am of your fear for that.
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.
Most true, he does.
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift, For which I wait for money.
It is against my heart.
One of Lord Timon's men.
No, indeed, he is not.
We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
Do you hear, sir?
What do ye ask of me, my friend?
We wait for certain money here, sir.
If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you; For you serve knaves.
O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
Good gods!
We cannot take this for answer, sir.
Servilius, help!
My lord!
my lord!
What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my house Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now, Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
My lord, here is my bill.
And mine, my lord.
All our bills.
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
Cut my heart in sums.
Mine, fifty talents.
Five thousand drops pays that.
What yours?
Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors?
devils!
My dear lord,
What if it should be so?
My lord,
I'll have it so.
My steward!
Here, my lord.
So fitly?
Most true; the law shall bruise him.
Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
Now, captain?
My lord,
My lords, then, under favour, pardon me, If I speak like a captain.
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle, And not endure all threats?
sleep upon't, And let the foes quietly cut their throats, Without repugnancy?
You breathe in vain.
In vain!
his service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life.
What's that?
He dies.
Hard fate!
Must it be so?
it must not be.
My lords, I do beseech you, know me.
How!
Call me to your remembrances.
What!
I cannot think but your age has forgot me; It could not else be, I should prove so base, To sue, and be denied such common grace: My wounds ache at you.
Do you dare our anger?
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect; We banish thee for ever.
Banish me!
Banish your dotage; banish usury, That makes the senate ugly.
If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee, Attend our weightier judgment.
And, not to swell our spirit, He shall be executed presently.
Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live Only in bone, that none may look on you!
The good time of day to you, sir.
I also wish it to you.
It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse.
Every man here's so.
What would he have borrowed of you?
A thousand pieces.
A thousand pieces!
What of you?
He sent to me, sir,  Here he comes.
Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger.
O, sir, let it not trouble you.
My noble lord,
Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
Think not on 't, sir.
If you had sent but two hours before,
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
Come, bring in all together.
Royal cheer, I warrant you.
Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield it.
How do you?
What's the news?
Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
Alcibiades banished!
'Tis so, be sure of it.
How!
how!
I pray you, upon what?
My worthy friends, will you draw near?
I'll tell you more anon.
Here's a noble feast toward.
This is the old man still.
Will 't hold?
will 't hold?
It does: but time will  and so
I do conceive.
What does his lordship mean?
I know not.
What, all in motion?
Henceforth be no feast, Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
Burn, house!
sink, Athens!
henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity!
How now, my lords!
Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
Push!
did you see my cap?
I have lost my gown.
He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
Did you see my cap?
Here 'tis.
Here lies my gown.
Let's make no stay.
Lord Timon's mad.
I feel 't upon my bones.
One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
Let me look back upon thee.
O thou wall, That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth, And fence not Athens!
Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
Are we undone?
cast off?
nothing remaining?
Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods, I am as poor as you.
Such a house broke!
So noble a master fall'n!
All gone!
and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm, And go along with him!
All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
Good fellows all, The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt, Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate With thy most operant poison!
What is here?
Gold?
yellow, glittering, precious gold?
No, gods, I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair, Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods!
why this?
what this, you gods?
Ha!
a drum ?
Thou'rt quick, But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief, When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
What art thou there?
speak.
A beast, as thou art.
The canker gnaw thy heart, For showing me again the eyes of man!
What is thy name?
Is man so hateful to thee, That art thyself a man?
I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog, That I might love thee something.
I know thee well; But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
I know thee too; and more than that I know thee, I not desire to know.
Follow thy drum; With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules: Religious canons, civil laws are cruel; Then what should war be?
This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword, For all her cherubim look.
Thy lips rot off!
I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns To thine own lips again.
How came the noble Timon to this change?
Noble Timon, What friendship may I do thee?
None, but to Maintain my opinion.
What is it, Timon?
Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art a man!
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
I see them now; then was a blessed time.
As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world Voiced so regardfully?
Art thou Timandra?
Yes.
Hang thee, monster!
I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
I had rather be alone.
Keep it, I cannot eat it.
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,
Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
Ay, Timon, and have cause.
The gods confound them all in thy conquest; And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
Why me, Timon?
That, by killing of villains, Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Hast thou gold yet?
I'll take the gold thou givest me, Not all thy counsel.
Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!
Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade, And to make whores, a bawd.
Well, more gold: what then?
Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
Strike up the drum towards Athens!
If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
I never did thee harm.
Yes, thou spokest well of me.
Call'st thou that harm?
Men daily find it.
Get thee away, and take Thy beagles with thee.
We but offend him.
Strike!
That nature, being sick of man's unkindness, Should yet be hungry!
Common mother, thou,
More man?
plague, plague!
I was directed hither: men report Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
This is in thee a nature but infected; A poor unmanly melancholy sprung From change of fortune.
Why this spade?
this place?
This slave like habit?
and these looks of care?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft; Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot That ever Timon was.
Shame not these woods, By putting on the cunning of a carper.
Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.
Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself; A madman so long, now a fool.
What, think'st That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, Will put thy shirt on warm?
will these moss'd trees, That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels, And skip where thou point'st out?
will the cold brook, Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste, To cure thy o'er night's surfeit?
A fool of thee: depart.
I love thee better now than e'er I did.
I hate thee worse.
Why?
Thou flatter'st misery.
I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.
Why dost thou seek me out?
To vex thee.
Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Dost please thyself in't?
Ay.
What!
a knave too?
Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
Art thou proud yet?
Ay, that I am not thee.
Here; I will mend thy feast.
First mend my company, take away thyself.
So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd; if not, I would it were.
What wouldst thou have to Athens?
Here is no use for gold.
The best and truest; For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
Where liest o' nights, Timon?
Under that's above me.
Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat it.
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
Where wouldst thou send it?
To sauce thy dishes.
On what I hate I feed not.
Dost hate a medlar?
Ay, though it look like thee.
An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst have loved thyself better now.
What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou ever know beloved?
Myself.
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?
Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
Ay, Timon.
A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to!
If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse: wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence.
Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of company light upon thee!
When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome.
I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
A plague on thee!
thou art too bad to curse.
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
If I name thee.
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
I would my tongue could rot them off!
Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Choler does kill me that thou art alive; I swound to see thee.
Would thou wouldst burst!
Away, Thou tedious rogue!
I am sorry I shall lose A stone by thee.
Beast!
Slave!
Toad!
Rogue, rogue, rogue!
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave; Lie where the light foam the sea may beat Thy grave stone daily: make thine epitaph, That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
O thou sweet king killer, and dear divorce 'Twixt natural son and sire!
thou bright defiler Of Hymen's purest bed!
Would 'twere so!
But not till I am dead.
I'll say thou'st gold: Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
Throng'd to!
Ay.
Thy back, I prithee.
Live, and love thy misery.
Long live so, and so die.
I am quit.
Moe things like men!
Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
Where should he have this gold?
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
Is not this he?
Where?
'Tis his description.
He; I know him.
Save thee, Timon.
Now, thieves?
Soldiers, not thieves.
Both too; and women's sons.
We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes; You must eat men.
Has almost charmed me from my profession, by persuading me to it.
'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
O you gods!
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
Away!
what art thou?
Have you forgot me, sir?
Why dost ask that?
An honest poor servant of yours.
The gods are witness, Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
What, dost thou weep?
Come nearer.
Had I a steward So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Look thee, 'tis so!
O, let me stay, And comfort you, my master.
As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he abides.
What's to be thought of him?
does the rumour hold for true, that he's so full of gold?
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
What have you now to present unto him?
I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that's coming toward him.
Good as the best.
Excellent workman!
thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself.
Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work?
wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men?
Do so, I have gold for thee.
I'll meet you at the turn.
What a god's gold, That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple Than where swine feed!
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam, Settlest admired reverence in a slave: To thee be worship!
Hail, worthy Timon!
Our late noble master!
Have I once lived to see two honest men?
He and myself Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts, And sweetly felt it.
Ay, you are honest men.
We are hither come to offer you our service.
Most honest men!
Why, how shall I requite you?
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water?
no.
What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
Good honest men!
So, so, my lord.
E'en so, sir, as I say.
And, for thy fiction, Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art.
Beseech your honour To make it known to us.
You'll take it ill.
Most thankfully, my lord.
Will you, indeed?
Doubt it not, worthy lord.
There's never a one of you but trusts a knave, That mightily deceives you.
Do we, my lord?
I know none such, my lord.
Nor I.
Name them, my lord, let's know them.
You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
Out, rascal dogs!
Here is his cave.
Peace and content be here!
Lord Timon!
Timon!
Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn!
Speak, and be hang'd: For each true word, a blister!
Worthy Timon,
Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
I thank them; and would send them back the plague, Could I but catch it for them.
O, forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
And shakes his threatening sword Against the walls of Athens.
Therefore, Timon,
Stay not, all's in vain.
We speak in vain.
But yet I love my country, and am not One that rejoices in the common wreck, As common bruit doth put it.
That's well spoke.
Commend me to my loving countrymen,
These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.
And enter in our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gates.
I like this well; he will return again.
His discontents are unremoveably Coupled to nature.
It requires swift foot.
Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files As full as thy report?
We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
Here come our brothers.
No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
By all description this should be the place.
Who's here?
speak, ho!
No answer!
What is this?
Sound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approach.
Noble and young, When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit, Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear, We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm, To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity.
What thou wilt, Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to't with thy sword.
Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope; So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before, To say thou'lt enter friendly.
'Tis most nobly spoken.
Descend, and keep your words.
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me As I am confident and kind to thee.
Open the gates, and let me in.
Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh, Before this earthy prison of their bones; That so the shadows be not unappeased, Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
I give him you, the noblest that survives, The eldest son of this distressed queen.
Stay, Roman brethren!
Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
Away with him!
and make a fire straight; And with our swords, upon a pile of wood, Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
O cruel, irreligious piety!
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
See, lord and father, how we have perform'd Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd, And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren, And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
Let it be so; and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons; Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest, Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long; My noble lord and father, live in fame!
Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days, And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother, Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
And welcome, nephews, from successful wars, You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
Patience, Prince Saturninus.
Romans, do me right: Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell, Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good That noble minded Titus means to thee!
Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
People of Rome, and people's tribunes here, I ask your voices and your suffrages: Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
To gratify the good Andronicus, And gratulate his safe return to Rome, The people will accept whom he admits.
With voices and applause of every sort, Patricians and plebeians, we create Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor, And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!  '
Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record, and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts, Romans, forget your fealty to me.
Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor; To him that, for your honour and your state, Will use you nobly and your followers.
A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
Not I, my lord; sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
Thanks, sweet Lavinia.
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
How, sir!
are you in earnest then, my lord?
Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal To do myself this reason and this right.
'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice: This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
Traitors, avaunt!
Where is the emperor's guard?
Treason, my lord!
Lavinia is surprised!
Surprised!
by whom?
By him that justly may Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
Brothers, help to convey her hence away, And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
My lord, you pass not here.
What, villain boy!
Barr'st me my way in Rome?
Help, Lucius, help!
My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so, In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine; My sons would never so dishonour me: Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife, That is another's lawful promised love.
O monstrous!
what reproachful words are these?
These words are razors to my wounded heart.
And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear, If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, She will a handmaid be to his desires, A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone, Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine, Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed That hath dishonour'd all our family; Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
But let us give him burial, as becomes; Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
Traitors, away!
he rests not in this tomb: This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I have sumptuously re edified: Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls: Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
And shall, or him we will accompany.
'And shall!  '
what villain was it that spake that word?
He that would vouch it in any place but here.
What, would you bury him in my despite?
No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,
Father, and in that name doth nature speak,
Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,
Dear father, soul and substance of us all,
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue's nest, That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
Rise, Marcus, rise.
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw, To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends, Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
No man shed tears for noble Mutius; He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps, How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
And you of yours, my lord!
I say no more, Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power, Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own, My truth betrothed love and now my wife?
But let the laws of Rome determine all; Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
My lord, what I have done, as best I may, Answer I must and shall do with my life.
Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds: 'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge, How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!
What, madam!
be dishonour'd openly, And basely put it up without revenge?
Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonour you!
Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
Titus, I am incorporate in Rome, A Roman now adopted happily, And must advise the emperor for his good.
This day all quarrels die, Andronicus; And let it be mine honour, good my lord, That I have reconciled your friends and you.
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd My word and promise to the emperor, That you will be more mild and tractable.
And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia; By my advice, all humbled on your knees, You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness, That what we did was mildly as we might, Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
That, on mine honour, here I do protest.
Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here, And at my lovely Tamora's entreats, I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge, And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
Demetrius, thou dost over ween in all; And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised, Gave you a dancing rapier by your side, Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it.
Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have, Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
Why, how now, lords!
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw, And maintain such a quarrel openly?
For that I am prepared and full resolved.
Foul spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue, And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
Away, I say!
I care not, I, knew she and all the world: I love Lavinia more than all the world.
Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice: Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
Why, are ye mad?
or know ye not, in Rome How furious and impatient they be, And cannot brook competitors in love?
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths By this device.
Aaron, a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
To achieve her!
how?
Why makest thou it so strange?
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd; She is a woman, therefore may be won; She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words, fair looks and liberality?
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe, And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns.
Ay, so the turn were served.
Aaron, thou hast hit it.
Would you had hit it too!
Then should not we be tired with this ado.
Why, hark ye, hark ye!
and are you such fools To square for this?
would it offend you, then That both should speed?
Faith, not me.
Nor me, so I were one.
Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
And you have rung it lustily, my lord; Somewhat too early for new married ladies.
Lavinia, how say you?
I say, no; I have been broad awake two hours and more.
Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have, And to our sport.
Madam, now shall ye see Our Roman hunting.
I have dogs, my lord, Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, And climb the highest promontory top.
And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.
Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound, But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
He that had wit would think that I had none, To bury so much gold under a tree, And never after to inherit it.
My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad, When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
Who have we here?
Rome's royal empress, Unfurnish'd of her well beseeming troop?
Or is it Dian, habited like her, Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest?
Saucy controller of our private steps!
Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body's hue, Spotted, detested, and abominable.
And, being intercepted in your sport, Great reason that my noble lord be rated
The king my brother shall have note of this.
Ay, for these slips have made him noted long: Good king, to be so mightily abused!
Why have I patience to endure all this?
How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
This is a witness that I am thy son.
And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora, For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole, And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
But when ye have the honey ye desire, Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy That nice preserved honesty of yours.
O Tamora!
thou bear'st a woman's face,
I will not hear her speak; away with her!
Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee; The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble; Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:  Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
I know not what it means; away with her!
O, let me teach thee!
for my father's sake, That gave thee life, when well he might have slain thee, Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me, Even for his sake am I pitiless.
O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen, And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long; Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
What begg'st thou, then?
fond woman, let me go.
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee: No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
Away!
for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
No grace?
no womanhood?
Nay, then I'll stop your mouth.
Bring thou her husband: This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed, Till all the Andronici be made away.
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor, And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
Come on, my lords, the better foot before: Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame, Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
What art thou fall'n?
O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
Now will I fetch the king to find them here, That he thereby may give a likely guess
Why dost not comfort me, and help me out From this unhallowed and blood stained hole?
I am surprised with an uncouth fear; A chilling sweat o'er runs my trembling joints: My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here, All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb, In this detested, dark, blood drinking pit.
If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
Along with me: I'll see what hole is here, And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
The unhappy son of old Andronicus: Brought hither in a most unlucky hour, To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
My brother dead!
I know thou dost but jest: He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase; 'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
We know not where you left him all alive; But, out, alas!
here have we found him dead.
Where is my lord the king?
Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
Where is thy brother Bassianus?
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound: Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind, Have here bereft my brother of his life.
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison: There let them bide until we have devised Some never heard of torturing pain for them.
What, are they in this pit?
If it be proved!
you see it is apparent.
Who found this letter?
Tamora, was it you?
Andronicus himself did take it up.
Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak, Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.
Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so, An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash; And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
Who is this?
my niece, that flies away so fast!
Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
If I do wake, some planet strike me down, That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
Hear me, grave fathers!
noble tribunes, stay!
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept; For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed; For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd; And for these bitter tears, which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks; Be pitiful to my condemned sons, Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
For two and twenty sons I never wept, Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
O reverend tribunes!
O gentle, aged men!
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death; And let me say, that never wept before, My tears are now prevailing orators.
Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,
My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
To rescue my two brothers from their death: For which attempt the judges have pronounced My everlasting doom of banishment.
O happy man!
Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep; Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break: I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
Will it consume me?
let me see it, then.
This was thy daughter.
Why, Marcus, so she is.
Ay me, this object kills me!
Faint hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea, Or brought a faggot to bright burning Troy?
My grief was at the height before thou camest, And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband; Perchance because she knows them innocent.
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed; Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief, See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
Patience, dear niece.
Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
Ah, Marcus, Marcus!
brother, well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine, For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
Mark, Marcus, mark!
O gracious emperor!
O gentle Aaron!
Did ever raven sing so like a lark, That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand: Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
Stay, father!
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome, And rear'd aloft the bloody battle axe, Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along, For fear they die before their pardon come.
My hand shall go.
By heaven, it shall not go!
Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son, Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
And, for our father's sake and mother's care, Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
But I will use the axe.
Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
Their heads, I mean.
O, how this villany Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven, And bow this feeble ruin to the earth: If any power pities wretched tears, To that I call!
What, wilt thou kneel with me?
Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers; Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim, And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
O brother, speak with possibilities, And do not break into these deep extremes.
Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
Then be my passions bottomless with them.
But yet let reason govern thy lament.
Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily, And be my heart an ever burning hell!
These miseries are more than may be borne.
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal; But sorrow flouted at is double death.
Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound, And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless As frozen water to a starved snake.
When will this fearful slumber have an end?
Ha, ha, ha!
Why dost thou laugh?
it fits not with this hour.
Fie, brother, fie!
teach her not thus to lay Such violent hands upon her tender life.
How now!
has sorrow made thee dote already?
Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands; To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er, How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands, Lest we remember still that we have none.
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk, As if we should forget we had no hands, If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments: Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved, Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears, And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.
Out on thee, murderer!
Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
How would he hang his slender gilded wings, And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
Poor harmless fly, That, with his pretty buzzing melody, Came here to make us merry!
and thou hast kill'd him.
Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill favor'd fly, Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.
O, O, O, Then pardon me for reprehending thee, For thou hast done a charitable deed.
Give me thy knife, I will insult on him; Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me.
Alas, poor man!
grief has so wrought on him, He takes false shadows for true substances.
Come, take away.
Lavinia, go with me: I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young, And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
Help, grandsire, help!
Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
Lucius, I will.
How now, Lavinia!
Marcus, what means this?
Some book there is that she desires to see.
Which is it, girl, of these?
Open them, boy.
But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd Come, and take choice of all my library, And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses; My mother gave it me.
For love of her that's gone, Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
Soft!
see how busily she turns the leaves!
See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl, Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was, Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
See, see!
Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt   O, had we never, never hunted there!
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes, By nature made for murders and for rapes.
O, why should nature build so foul a den, Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury, Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
'Stuprum.
Chiron.
Demetrius.  '
What, what!
the lustful sons of Tamora Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
Magni Dominator poli, Tam lentus audis scelera?
tam lentus vides?
O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know There is enough written upon this earth To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
But if you hunt these bear whelps, then beware: The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once, She's with the lion deeply still in league, And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back, And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
Ay, that's my boy!
thy father hath full oft For his ungrateful country done the like.
And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
Lavinia, come.
Marcus, look to my house: Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court: Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
O heavens, can you hear a good man groan, And not relent, or not compassion him?
Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy, That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield; But yet so just that he will not revenge.
Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!
Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius; He hath some message to deliver us.
Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
My lords, with all the humbleness I may, I greet your honours from Andronicus.
And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
That you are both decipher'd, that's the news, For villains mark'd with rape.
What's here?
A scroll; and written round about?
O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well: I read it in the grammar long ago.
Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
But me more good, to see so great a lord
Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
I would we had a thousand Roman dames At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
A charitable wish and full of love.
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
And that would she for twenty thousand more.
Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods For our beloved mother in her pains.
Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
Soft!
who comes here?
Good morr ow, lords: O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all, Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye, Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
To whom?
I mean, she is brought a bed.
Well, God give her good rest!
What hath he sent her?
A devil.
Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
'Zounds, ye whore!
is black so base a hue?
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
Villain, what hast thou done?
That which thou canst not undo.
Thou hast undone our mother.
Villain, I have done thy mother.
And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
It shall not live.
It shall not die.
Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
What, must it, nurse?
then let no man but I Do execution on my flesh and blood.
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point: Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
By this our mother is forever shamed.
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
I blush to think upon this ignomy.
Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears: Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
How many women saw this child of his?
Why, so, brave lords!
when we join in league, I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor, The chafed boar, the mountain lioness, The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
But say, again; how many saw the child?
Cornelia the midwife and myself; And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
What mean'st thou, Aaron?
wherefore didst thou this?
Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air With secrets.
For this care of Tamora, Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies; There to dispose this treasure in mine arms, And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
Sir boy, now let me see your archery; Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
Terras Astraea reliquit: Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
Sirs, take you to your tools.
O Publius, is not this a heavy case, To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns By day and night to attend him carefully, And feed his humour kindly as we may, Till time beget some careful remedy.
Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude, And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
Publius, how now!
how now, my masters!
What, have you met with her?
He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
I'll dive into the burning lake below, And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court: We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
Now, masters, draw.
My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon; Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
Ha, ha!
Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
O, the gibbet maker!
he says that he hath taken them down again, for the man must not be hanged till the next week.
But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all my life.
Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
From heaven!
Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?
Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado, But give your pigeons to the emperor: By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
Give me pen and ink.
Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver a supplication?
Ay, sir.
Then here is a supplication for you.
And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel, then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and then look for your reward.
I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.
I warrant you, sir, let me alone.
Sirrah, hast thou a knife?
come, let me see it.
Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration; For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
And when thou hast given it the emperor, Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
God be with you, sir; I will.
Come, Marcus, let us go.
Publius, follow me.
Why, lords, what wrongs are these!
was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne, Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent Of equal justice, used in such contempt?
My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods, However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd, But even with law, against the willful sons Of old Andronicus.
How now, good fellow!
wouldst thou speak with us?
Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
'Tis he.
God and Saint Stephen give you good den: I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
How much money must I have?
Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
Hanged!
by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
I know from whence this same device proceeds: May this be borne?
as if his traitorous sons, That died by law for murder of our brother, Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
What news with thee, AEmilius?
Arm, arm, my lord;  Rome never had more cause.
Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
Why should you fear?
is not your city strong?
Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius, And will revolt from me to succor him.
King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
But he will not entreat his son for us.
Your bidding shall I do effectually.
Now will I to that old Andronicus; And temper him with all the art I have, To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again, And bury all thy fear in my devices.
Then go successantly, and plead to him.
Approved warriors, and my faithful friends, I have received letters from great Rome, Which signify what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are.
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness, Imperious and impatient of your wrongs, And wherein Rome hath done you any scath, Let him make treble satisfaction.
And as he saith, so say we all with him.
I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd To gaze upon a ruinous monastery; And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building, suddenly
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
Too like the sire for ever being good.
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl; A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Get me a ladder.
Lucius, save the child, And bear it from me to the empress.
Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
An if it please thee!
Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
Who should I swear by?
thou believest no god: That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
What if I do not?
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus; They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
O detestable villain!
call'st thou that trimming?
Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
Bring down the devil; for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently.
If there be devils, would I were a devil, To live and burn in everlasting fire, So I might have your company in hell, But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
My lord, there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence.
Let him come near.
Welcome, AEmilius what's the news from Rome?
What says our general?
AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment, I will encounter with Andronicus, And say I am Revenge, sent from below To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps, To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge; Tell him Revenge is come to join with him, And work confusion on his enemies.
Who doth molest my contemplation?
Is it your trick to make me ope the door, That so my sad decrees may fly away, And all my study be to no effect?
You are deceived: for what I mean to do See here in bloody lines I have set down; And what is written shall be executed.
Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.
Art thou Revenge?
and art thou sent to me, To be a torment to mine enemies?
I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
Do me some service, ere I come to thee.
These are my ministers, and come with me.
Are these thy ministers?
what are they call'd?
Rapine and Murder; therefore called so, Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
And you, the empress!
but we worldly men Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee; And, if one arm's embracement will content thee, I will embrace thee in it by and by.
What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
Show me a villain that hath done a rape, And I am sent to be revenged on him.
Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong, And I will be revenged on them all.
Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
Marcus, my brother!
'tis sad Titus calls.
This will I do, and soon return again.
Now will I hence about thy business, And take my ministers along with me.
What say you, boys?
will you bide with him, Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor How I have govern'd our determined jest?
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair, And tarry with him till I turn again.
Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
What is your will?
Know you these two?
The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
Fie, Publius, fie!
Villains, forbear!
we are the empress' sons.
And therefore do we what we are commanded.
Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
Is he sure bound?
look that you bind them fast.
Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind That I repair to Rome, I am content.
And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear, And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
Away, inhuman dog!
unhallow'd slave!
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle; These quarrels must be quietly debated.
Marcus, we will.
Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?
Because I would be sure to have all well, To entertain your highness and your empress.
We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
It was, Andronicus.
Your reason, mighty lord?
Because the girl should not survive her shame, And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
I am as woful as Virginius was, And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage: and it now is done.
What, was she ravish'd?
tell who did the deed.
Will't please you eat?
will't please your highness feed?
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
Go fetch them hither to us presently.
Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
Now is my turn to speak.
Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,  And hither hale that misbelieving Moor, To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death, As punishment for his most wicked life.
Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so, To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
O grandsire, grandsire!
even with all my heart Would I were dead, so you did live again!
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping; My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
You sad Andronici, have done with woes: Give sentence on this execrable wretch, That hath been breeder of these dire events.
O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
Will this gear ne'er be mended?
Have I not tarried?
Have I not tarried?
Still have I tarried.
Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be, Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
At Priam's royal table do I sit; And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,   So, traitor!
'When she comes!  '
When is she thence?
Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any woman else.
O Pandarus!
I speak no more than truth.
Thou dost not speak so much.
Faith, I'll not meddle in't.
Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
What, art thou angry, Pandarus?
what, with me?
Say I she is not fair?
I do not care whether you do or no.
Pandarus,
Not I.
Sweet Pandarus,
Peace, you ungracious clamours!
peace, rude sounds!
Fools on both sides!
Helen must needs be fair, When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
I cannot fight upon this argument; It is too starved a subject for my sword.
How now, Prince Troilus!
wherefore not afield?
That Paris is returned home and hurt.
By whom, AEneas?
Troilus, by Menelaus.
Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn; Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
Hark, what good sport is out of town to day!
Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.  '
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
In all swift haste.
Come, go we then together.
Who were those went by?
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
And whither go they?
What was his cause of anger?
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector; They call him Ajax.
Good; and what of him?
They say he is a very man per se, And stands alone.
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?
Who comes here?
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
Hector's a gallant man.
As may be in the world, lady.
What's that?
what's that?
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
Good morrow, Alexander.
How do you, cousin?
When were you at Ilium?
This morning, uncle.
What were you talking of when I came?
Was Hector armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium?
Helen was not up, was she?
Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
Even so: Hector was stirring early.
That were we talking of, and of his anger.
Was he angry?
So he says here.
What, is he angry too?
Who, Troilus?
Troilus is the better man of the two.
O Jupiter!
What, not between Troilus and Hector?
Do you know a man if you see him?
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
Himself!
Alas, poor Troilus!
I would he were.
So he is.
Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
He is not Hector.
Himself!
no, he's not himself: would a' were himself!
Excuse me.
He is elder.
Pardon me, pardon me.
He shall not need it, if he have his own.
Nor his qualities.
No matter.
Nor his beauty.
'Twould not become him; his own's better.
No, but brown.
'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
To say the truth, true and not true.
She praised his complexion above Paris.
Why, Paris hath colour enough.
So he has.
I swear to you.
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
Nay, I am sure she does.
She came to him th' other day into the compassed window,  and, you know, he has not past three or four hairs on his chin,
Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.
Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
Juno have mercy!
how came it cloven?
O, he smiles valiantly.
Does he not?
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus,
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
Troilus!
why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
Without the rack.
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
Alas, poor chin!
With mill stones.
And Cassandra laughed.
And Hector laughed.
At what was all this laughing?
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed too.
They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
What was his answer?
Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them is white.
This is her question.
That's true; make no question of that.
So let it now; for it has been while going by.
Well, cousin.
I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
So I do.
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere a man born in April.
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle against May.
At your pleasure.
Speak not so loud.
That's AEneas: is not that a brave man?
Who's that?
Will he give you the nod?
You shall see.
If he do, the rich shall have more.
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a fellow !
Go thy way, Hector!
There's a brave man, niece.
O brave Hector!
Look how he looks!
there's a countenance!
is't not a brave man?
O, a brave man!
Is a' not?
it does a man's heart good.
Look you what hacks are on his helmet!
look you yonder, do you see?
Be those with swords?
Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not?
Why, this is brave now.
Who said he came hurt home to day?
Who's that?
That's Helenus.
I marvel where Troilus is.
That's Helenus.
I think he went not forth to day.
That's Helenus.
Can Helenus fight, uncle?
Helenus?
no.
Yes, he'll fight indifferent well.
I marvel where Troilus is.
Hark!
do you not hear the people cry 'Troilus'?
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
Where?
yonder?
that's Deiphobus.
'Tis Troilus!
there's a man, niece!
Hem!
Brave Troilus!
Peace, for shame, peace!
Mark him; note him.
O brave Troilus!
Here come more.
Asses, fools, dolts!
chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
porridge after meat!
I could live and die i' the eyes of Troilus.
Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws!
There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
Achilles!
a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
Well, well.
'Well, well!  '
why, have you any discretion?
have you any eyes?
Do you know what a man is?
Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
You are such a woman!
one knows not at what ward you lie.
Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand watches.
Say one of your watches.
You are such another!
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
Where?
At your own house; there he unarms him.
Good boy, tell him I come.
I doubt he be hurt.
Fare ye well, good niece.
Adieu, uncle.
I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
To bring, uncle?
Ay, a token from Troilus.
By the same token, you are a bawd.
Princes, What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
With due observance of thy godlike seat, Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply Thy latest words.
most mighty for thy place and sway,
Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down, And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master, But for these instances.
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd The fever whereof all our power is sick.
The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, What is the remedy?
And in the imitation of these twain   Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns With an imperial voice  many are infect.
Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse Makes many Thetis' sons.
What trumpet?
look, Menelaus.
From Troy.
What would you 'fore our tent?
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
Even this.
May one, that is a herald and a prince, Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
Fair leave and large security.
How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals?
How!
This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers.
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
Ay, Greek, that is my name.
What's your affair I pray you?
Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him: I bring a trumpet to awake his ear, To set his sense on the attentive bent, And then to speak.
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
Amen.
Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand; To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
Nestor!
What says Ulysses?
What is't?
Well, and how?
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends, However it is spread in general name, Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
And wake him to the answer, think you?
Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose, That can from Hector bring his honour off, If not Achilles?
I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
Thersites!
Agamemnon, how if he had boils?
Thersites!
Dog!
Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
Thou bitch wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef witted lord!
Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will beat thee into handsomeness.
Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
The proclamation!
Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece.
When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
I say, the proclamation!
Mistress Thersites!
Thou shouldest strike him.
Cobloaf!
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a sailor breaks a biscuit.
You whoreson cur!
Do, do.
Thou stool for a witch!
Ay, do, do; thou sodden witted lord!
You dog!
You scurvy lord!
You cur!
Why, how now, Ajax!
wherefore do you thus?
How now, Thersites!
You see him there, do you?
Ay; what's the matter?
Nay, look upon him.
So I do: what's the matter?
Nay, but regard him well.
'Well!  '
I know that, fool.
Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
Therefore I beat thee.
Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters!
his evasions have ears thus long.
What?
I say, this Ajax
Nay, good Ajax.
Has not so much wit
Nay, I must hold you.
As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he comes to fight.
Peace, fool!
I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not: he there: that he: look you there.
O thou damned cur!
I shall
Will you set your wit to a fool's?
No, I warrant you; for a fool's will shame it.
Good words, Thersites.
What's the quarrel?
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.
I serve thee not.
Well, go to, go to.
I serve here voluntarily.
What, with me too, Thersites?
There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the wars.
What, what?
Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles!
I shall cut out your tongue.
No more words, Thersites; peace!
I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
There's for you, Patroclus.
A good riddance.
Farewell.
I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise He knew his man.
O, meaning you.
I will go learn more of it.
After so many hours, lives, speeches spent, Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks: 'Deliver Helen, and all damage else   As honour, loss of time, travail, expense, Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed In hot digestion of this cormorant war   Shall be struck off.  '
Hector, what say you to't?
Fie, fie, my brother!
No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons, You are so empty of them.
Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons, Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest; You fur your gloves with reason.
Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost The holding.
What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
Cry, Trojans, cry!
What noise?
what shriek is this?
'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
Cry, Trojans!
It is Cassandra.
Cry, Trojans, cry!
lend me ten thousand eyes, And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
Peace, sister, peace!
Virgins and boys, mid age and wrinkled eld, Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry, Add to my clamours!
let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Cry, Trojans, cry!
practise your eyes with tears!
Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse?
or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason, Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause, Can qualify the same?
Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels: But I attest the gods, your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project.
For what, alas, can these my single arms?
Sir, I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it; But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen, Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me, Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion!
Why, there you touch'd the life of our design: Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens, I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence.
I am yours, You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
How now, Thersites!
what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury!
Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus?
He beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
would it were otherwise; that I could beat him, whilst he railed at me.
'Sfoot, I'll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations.
Then there's Achilles, a rare enginer!
If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves.
Who's there?
Thersites!
Good Thersites, come in and rail.
If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself!
What, art thou devout?
wast thou in prayer?
Ay: the heavens hear me!
Who's there?
Thersites, my lord.
Where, where?
Art thou come?
why, my cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals?
Come, what's Agamemnon?
Thy commander, Achilles.
Then tell me, Patroclus, what's Achilles?
Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee, what's thyself?
Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?
Thou mayst tell that knowest.
O, tell, tell.
I'll decline the whole question.
Agamemnon commands Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus' knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
You rascal!
Peace, fool!
I have not done.
He is a privileged man.
Proceed, Thersites.
Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
Derive this; come.
Why am I a fool?
Make that demand of the prover.
It suffices me thou art.
Look you, who comes here?
Here is such patchery, such juggling and such knavery!
all the argument is a cuckold and a whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon.
Now, the dry serpigo on the subject!
and war and lechery confound all!
Where is Achilles?
Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
Let it be known to him that we are here.
I shall say so to him.
We saw him at the opening of his tent: He is not sick.
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
Who, Thersites?
He.
Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
No, you see, he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.
The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.
Here comes Patroclus.
No Achilles with him.
The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy: his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
In second voice we'll not be satisfied; We come to speak with him.
Ulysses, enter you.
What is he more than another?
No more than what he thinks he is.
Is he so much?
Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?
No question.
Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.
Why should a man be proud?
How doth pride grow?
I know not what pride is.
Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer.
I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
Achilles will not to the field to morrow.
What's his excuse?
He doth rely on none, But carries on the stream of his dispose Without observance or respect of any, In will peculiar and in self admission.
Why will he not upon our fair request Untent his person and share the air with us?
Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent: 'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led At your request a little from himself.
O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.
And how his silence drinks up this applause!
If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
O, no, you shall not go.
An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride: Let me go to him.
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
A paltry, insolent fellow!
How he describes himself!
Can he not be sociable?
The raven chides blackness.
I'll let his humours blood.
He will be the physician that should be the patient.
An all men were o' my mind,
Wit would be out of fashion.
A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first: shall pride carry it?
An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
A' would have ten shares.
I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
He's not yet through warm: force him with praises: pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
Our noble general, do not do so.
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
Here is a man  but 'tis before his face; I will be silent.
Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
Would he were a Trojan!
What a vice were it in Ajax now,
If he were proud,
Or covetous of praise,
Ay, or surly borne,
Or strange, or self affected!
Shall I call you father?
Ay, my good son.
Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles Keeps thicket .
Go we to council.
Let Achilles sleep: Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
Friend, you!
pray you, a word: do not you follow the young Lord Paris?
Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
You depend upon him, I mean?
Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs praise him.
The lord be praised!
You know me, do you not?
Faith, sir, superficially.
Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
I hope I shall know your honour better.
I do desire it.
You are in the state of grace.
Grace!
not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
What music is this?
I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
Know you the musicians?
Wholly, sir.
Who play they to?
To the hearers, sir.
At whose pleasure, friend
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
Command, I mean, friend.
Who shall I command, sir?
Friend, we understand not one another: I am too courtly and thou art too cunning.
At whose request do these men play?
Who, my cousin Cressida?
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida.
I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.
Sodden business!
there's a stewed phrase indeed!
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company!
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen.
Fair prince, here is good broken music.
Truly, lady, no.
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
Well said, my lord!
I have business to my lord, dear queen.
My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?
Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you sing, certainly.
My Lord Pandarus; honey sweet lord,
Sweet queen, sweet queen!
that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not, in truth, la.
Nay, I care not for such words; no, no.
And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
My Lord Pandarus,
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
Nay, but, my lord,
What says my sweet queen?
My cousin will fall out with you.
You must not know where he sups.
I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your disposer is sick.
Well, I'll make excuse.
Ay, good my lord.
Why should you say Cressida?
no, your poor disposer's sick.
I spy.
You spy!
what do you spy?
Come, give me an instrument.
Now, sweet queen.
Why, this is kindly done.
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.
She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing you a song now.
Ay, ay, prithee now.
By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine forehead.
Ay, you may, you may.
Love!
ay, that it shall, i' faith.
Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
In good troth, it begins so.
Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot blood.
Is this the generation of love?
hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds?
Why, they are vipers: is love a generation of vipers?
Sweet lord, who's a field to day?
He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
Not I, honey sweet queen.
I long to hear how they sped to day.
You'll remember your brother's excuse?
To a hair.
Farewell, sweet queen.
Commend me to your niece.
I will, sweet queen.
Sweet, above thought I love thee.
How now!
where's thy master?
at my cousin Cressida's?
No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
O, here he comes.
How now, how now!
Sirrah, walk off.
Have you seen my cousin?
Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you must be witty now.
Come, come, what need you blush?
shame's a baby.
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.
What, are you gone again?
you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward, we'll put you i' the fills.
Why do you not speak to her?
Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your picture.
You have bereft me of all words, lady.
Will you walk in, my lord?
O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
Wished, my lord!
The gods grant,  O my lord!
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
Nor nothing monstrous neither?
They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform, vowing more than the perfection often and discharging less than the tenth part of one.
They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?
Are there such?
Will you walk in, my lord?
What, blushing still?
have you not done talking yet?
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my firm faith.
Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day For many weary months.
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
Pretty, i' faith.
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me; 'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss: I am ashamed.
O heavens!
what have I done?
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
Your leave, sweet Cressid!
Leave!
an you take leave till to morrow morning,
Pray you, content you.
What offends you, lady?
Sir, mine own company.
You cannot shun yourself.
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
In that I'll war with you.
O virtuous fight, When right with right wars who shall be most right!
Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the witness.
Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Now, princes, for the service I have done you, The advantage of the time prompts me aloud To call for recompense.
What wouldst thou of us, Trojan?
make demand.
You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor, Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden Which I am proud to bear.
What, comes the general to speak with me?
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
What says Achilles?
would he aught with us?
Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
No.
Nothing, my lord.
The better.
Good day, good day.
How do you?
how do you?
What, does the cuckold scorn me?
How now, Patroclus!
Good morrow, Ajax.
Ha?
Good morrow.
Ay, and good next day too.
What mean these fellows?
Know they not Achilles?
What, am I poor of late?
Now, great Thetis' son!
What are you reading?
This is not strange, Ulysses.
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
Of this my privacy I have strong reasons.
Ha!
Is that a wonder?
The providence that's in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold, Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps, Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods, Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gored.
A labour saved!
A wonder!
What?
Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
How so?
He must fight singly to morrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.
How can that be?
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
Who, I?
why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not answering: speaking is for beggars ; he wears his tongue in's arms.
Jove bless great Ajax!
Hum!
I come from the worthy Achilles,
Ha!
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,
Hum!
And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.
Agamemnon!
Ay, my lord.
Ha!
What say you to't?
God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
Your answer, sir.
Your answer, sir.
Fare you well, with all my heart.
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
No, but he's out o' tune thus.
Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more capable creature.
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd; And I myself see not the bottom of it.
See, ho!
who is that there?
It is the Lord AEneas.
Is the prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bed mate of my company.
That's my mind too.
Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
But when contention and occasion meet, By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life With all my force, pursuit and policy.
And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly With his face backward.
In humane gentleness, Welcome to Troy!
now, by Anchises' life, Welcome, indeed!
By Venus' hand I swear, No man alive can love in such a sort The thing he means to kill more excellently.
We know each other well.
We do; and long to know each other worse.
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting, The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
What business, lord, so early?
I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
That I assure you: Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece Than Cressid borne from Troy.
There is no help; The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so.
On, lord; we'll follow you.
Good morrow, all.
You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down; He shall unbolt the gates.
Good morrow, then.
I prithee now, to bed.
Are you a weary of me?
O Cressida!
Night hath been too brief.
Beshrew the witch!
with venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary swift than thought.
Prithee, tarry: You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid!
What, 's all the doors open here?
It is your uncle.
A pestilence on him!
now will he be mocking: I shall have such a life!
How now, how now!
how go maidenheads?
Here, you maid!
where's my cousin Cressid?
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
To do what?
to do what?
let her say what: what have I brought you to do?
Come, come, beshrew your heart!
you'll ne'er be good, Nor suffer others.
Ha!
ha!
Alas, poor wretch!
ah, poor capocchia!
hast not slept to night?
would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep?
Did not I tell you?
Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Who's that at door?
good uncle, go and see.
Ha, ha!
Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
How earnestly they knock!
Who's there?
what's the matter?
will you beat down the door?
How now!
what's the matter?
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
Who's there?
my Lord AEneas!
Is not Prince Troilus here?
Here!
what should he do here?
Is he here, say you?
How now!
Is it so concluded?
By Priam and the general state of Troy: They are at hand and ready to effect it.
How my achievements mock me!
I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas, We met by chance; you did not find me here.
Is't possible?
no sooner got but lost?
The devil take Antenor!
the young prince will go mad: a plague upon Antenor!
I would they had broke's neck!
How now!
what's the matter?
Ah, ah!
Why sigh you so profoundly?
where's my lord?
gone!
Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
O the gods!
what's the matter?
Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been born!
I knew thou wouldst be his death.
O, poor gentleman!
A plague upon Antenor!
Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees!
O you immortal gods!
I will not go.
Thou must.
Do, do.
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks, Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart With sounding Troilus.
I will not go from Troy.
It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd Of her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon.
Good my brother Troilus, Tell you the lady what she is to do, And haste her to the purpose.
I know what 'tis to love; And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
Please you walk in, my lords.
Be moderate, be moderate.
Why tell you me of moderation?
Here, here, here he comes.
Ah, sweet ducks!
O Troilus!
Troilus!
What a pair of spectacles is here!
Let me embrace too.
Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity, That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy, More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
Have the gods envy?
Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
And is it true that I must go from Troy?
A hateful truth.
What, and from Troilus too?
From Troy and Troilus.
Is it possible?
My lord, is the lady ready?
Hark!
Where are my tears?
rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown up by the root.
I must then to the Grecians?
No remedy.
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?
Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,
I true!
how now!
what wicked deem is this?
O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers As infinite as imminent!
but I'll be true.
And I'll grow friend with danger.
Wear this sleeve.
And you this glove.
When shall I see you?
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels, To give thee nightly visitation.
But yet be true.
O heavens!
'be true' again!
O heavens!
you love me not.
Die I a villain, then!
Do you think I will?
No.
But something may be done that we will not: And sometimes we are devils to ourselves, When we will tempt the frailty of our powers, Presuming on their changeful potency.
Nay, good my lord,
Come, kiss; and let us part.
Brother Troilus!
Good brother, come you hither; And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
My lord, will you be true?
Who, I?
Welcome, Sir Diomed!
Come, to the port.
I'll tell thee, Diomed, This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk, To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
Hark!
How have we spent this morning!
The prince must think me tardy and remiss, That swore to ride before him to the field.
'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
Let us make ready straight.
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair, Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy, Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air May pierce the head of the great combatant And hale him hither.
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
No trumpet answers.
'Tis but early days.
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
Is this the Lady Cressid?
Even she.
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
Yet is the kindness but particular; 'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.
I had good argument for kissing once.
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine: Patroclus kisses you.
O, this is trim!
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
I'll have my kiss, sir.
Lady, by your leave.
In kissing, do you render or receive?
I'll make my match to live, The kiss you take is better than you give; Therefore no kiss.
You're an odd man; give even or give none.
An odd man, lady!
every man is odd.
No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true, That you are odd, and he is even with you.
You fillip me o' the head.
No, I'll be sworn.
It were no match, your nail against his horn.
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
You may.
I do desire it.
Why, beg, then.
Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss, When Helen is a maid again, and his.
I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
A woman of quick sense.
Fie, fie upon her!
The Trojans' trumpet.
Yonder comes the troop.
Hail, all you state of Greece!
what shall be done To him that victory commands?
or do you purpose A victor shall be known?
Which way would Hector have it?
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done, A little proudly, and great deal misprizing The knight opposed.
If not Achilles, sir, What is your name?
If not Achilles, nothing.
A maiden battle, then?
O, I perceive you.
Here is Sir Diomed.
They are opposed already.
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
They are in action.
Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
Hector, thou sleep'st; Awake thee!
His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
You must no more.
Princes, enough, so please you.
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
As Hector pleases.
There is expectance here from both the sides, What further you will do.
We'll answer it; The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
If I might in entreaties find success   As seld I have the chance   I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
Worthy of arms!
I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
My well famed lord of Troy, no less to you.
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting: You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
Who must we answer?
The noble Menelaus.
O, you, my lord?
by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath; Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove: She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
O, pardon; I offend.
'Tis the old Nestor.
I would my arms could match thee in contention, As they contend with thee in courtesy.
I would they could.
Ha!
By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to morrow.
Well, welcome, welcome!
I have seen the time.
I wonder now how yonder city stands When we have here her base and pillar by us.
I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead, Since first I saw yourself and Diomed In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
So to him we leave it.
I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
Is this Achilles?
I am Achilles.
Behold thy fill.
Nay, I have done already.
Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body Shall I destroy him?
whether there, or there, or there?
That I may give the local wound a name And make distinct the very breach whereout Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
I tell thee, yea.
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so, I'd not believe thee.
Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
To morrow do I meet thee, fell as death; To night all friends.
Thy hand upon that match.
Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much, After we part from Agamemnon's tent, To bring me thither?
You shall command me, sir.
As gentle tell me, of what honour was This Cressida in Troy?
Had she no lover there That wails her absence?
O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars A mock is due.
Will you walk on, my lord?
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to night, Which with my scimitar I'll cool to morrow.
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
Here comes Thersites.
How now, thou core of envy!
Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
From whence, fragment?
Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
Who keeps the tent now?
The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
Male varlet, you rogue!
what's that?
Why, his masculine whore.
Do I curse thee?
Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.
No!
Out, gall!
Finch egg!
My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite From my great purpose in to morrow's battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba, A token from her daughter, my fair love, Both taxing me and gaging me to keep An oath that I have sworn.
I will not break it: Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay; My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent: This night in banqueting must all be spent.
We go wrong, we go wrong.
No, yonder 'tis; There, where we see the lights.
I trouble you.
No, not a whit.
Here comes himself to guide you.
Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.
So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
Good night, my lord.
Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a!
sweet sink, sweet sewer.
Good night and welcome, both at once, to those That go or tarry.
Good night.
Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed, Keep Hector company an hour or two.
I cannot, lord; I have important business, The tide whereof is now.
Good night, great Hector.
Give me your hand.
Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas' tent: I'll keep you company.
Sweet sir, you honour me.
And so, good night.
Come, come, enter my tent.
What, are you up here, ho?
speak.
Who calls?
Calchas, I think.
Where's your daughter?
She comes to you.
Stand where the torch may not discover us.
Cressid comes forth to him.
How now, my charge!
Now, my sweet guardian!
Hark, a word with you.
Yea, so familiar!
She will sing any man at first sight.
And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff; she's noted.
Will you remember?
Remember!
Nay, but do, then; And let your mind be coupled with your words.
What should she remember?
List.
Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
Roguery!
Nay, then,
I'll tell you what,
Foh, foh!
come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
A juggling trick,  to be secretly open.
What did you swear you would bestow on me?
Good night.
Hold, patience!
How now, Trojan!
Diomed,
Thy better must.
Hark, one word in your ear.
O plague and madness!
Behold, I pray you!
I pray thee, stay.
You have not patience; come.
And so, good night.
Nay, but you part in anger.
Doth that grieve thee?
O wither'd truth!
Why, how now, lord!
By Jove, I will be patient.
Guardian!
why, Greek!
Foh, foh!
In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
You will break out.
She strokes his cheek!
Come, come.
How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and potato finger, tickles these together!
Fry, lechery, fry!
But will you, then?
In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.
Give me some token for the surety of it.
I'll fetch you one.
You have sworn patience.
Now the pledge; now, now, now!
Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
O beauty!
where is thy faith?
My lord,
I will be patient; outwardly I will.
You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
He loved me  O false wench!
Give't me again.
Whose was't?
It is no matter, now I have't again.
I will not meet with you to morrow night:
Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
I shall have it.
What, this?
Ay, that.
O, all you gods!
O pretty, pretty pledge!
I had your heart before, this follows it.
I did swear patience.
I will have this: whose was it?
It is no matter.
Come, tell me whose it was.
'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
But, now you have it, take it.
Whose was it?
By all Diana's waiting women yond, And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
To morrow will I wear it on my helm, And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn, It should be challenged.
Why, then, farewell; Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
I do not like this fooling.
What, shall I come?
the hour?
Ay, come:  O Jove!
do come:  I shall be plagued.
Farewell till then.
Good night: I prithee, come.
Troilus, farewell!
one eye yet looks on thee But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah, poor our sex!
A proof of strength she could not publish more, Unless she said "My mind is now turn'd whore.  "
All's done, my lord.
It is.
Why stay we, then?
To make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke.
But if I tell how these two did co act, Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart, An esperance so obstinately strong, That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears, As if those organs had deceptious functions, Created only to calumniate.
Was Cressid here?
She was not, sure.
Most sure she was.
Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
Let it not be believed for womanhood!
What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
This she?
May worthy Troilus be half attach'd With that which here his passion doth express?
He'll tickle it for his concupy.
O Cressid!
O false Cressid!
false, false, false!
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name, And they'll seem glorious.
O, contain yourself Your passion draws ears hither.
Have with you, prince.
My courteous lord, adieu.
Farewell, revolted fair!
and, Diomed, Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
I'll bring you to the gates.
When was my lord so much ungently temper'd, To stop his ears against admonishment?
My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
No more, I say.
Where is my brother Hector?
Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
O, 'tis true.
Ho!
bid my trumpet sound!
No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
O, be persuaded!
How now, young man!
mean'st thou to fight to day?
Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
What vice is that, good Troilus?
chide me for it.
When many times the captive Grecian falls, Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword, You bid them rise, and live.
O,'tis fair play.
Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
How now!
For the love of all the gods, Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers, And when we have our armours buckled on, The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords, Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
Fie, savage, fie!
Hector, then 'tis wars.
Troilus, I would not have you fight to day.
Who should withhold me?
Ay, but thou shalt not go.
I must not break my faith.
O Priam, yield not to him!
Do not, dear father.
This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl Makes all these bodements.
O, farewell, dear Hector!
Look, how thou diest!
look, how thy eye turns pale!
Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
Hark, how Troy roars!
how Hecuba cries out!
Away!
Farewell: yet, soft!
They are at it, hark!
Proud Diomed, believe, I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
Do you hear, my lord?
do you hear?
What now?
Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
Let me read.
Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
My love with words and errors still she feeds; But edifies another with her deeds.
Now they are clapper clawing one another; I'll go look on.
Thou dost miscall retire: I do not fly, but advantageous care Withdrew me from the odds of multitude: Have at thee!
Hold thy whore, Grecian!
now for thy whore, Trojan!
now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
What art thou, Greek?
art thou for Hector's match?
Art thou of blood and honour?
No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave: a very filthy rogue.
I do believe thee: live.
God a mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a plague break thy neck for frightening me!
What's become of the wenching rogues?
I think they have swallowed one another: I would laugh at that miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
I'll seek them.
I go, my lord.
Renew, renew!
Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles; And bid the snail paced Ajax arm for shame.
O, courage, courage, princes!
Troilus!
thou coward Troilus!
Ay, there, there.
So, so, we draw together.
Where is this Hector?
Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
Troilus, I say!
where's Troilus?
What wouldst thou?
I would correct him.
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office Ere that correction.
Troilus, I say!
what, Troilus!
O traitor Diomed!
turn thy false face, thou traitor, And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
Ha, art thou there?
I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
He is my prize; I will not look upon.
Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
Yea, Troilus?
O, well fought, my youngest brother!
Now do I see thee, ha!
have at thee, Hector!
Pause, if thou wilt.
Fare thee well: I would have been much more a fresher man, Had I expected thee.
How now, my brother!
Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark: No?
wilt thou not?
Come here about me, you my Myrmidons; Mark what I say.
Attend me where I wheel: Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath: And when I have the bloody Hector found, Empale him with your weapons round about; In fellest manner execute your aims.
The cuckold and the cuckold maker are at it.
Now, bull!
now, dog!
'Loo, Paris, 'loo!
now my double  henned sparrow!
'loo, Paris, 'loo!
The bull has the game: ware horns, ho!
Turn, slave, and fight.
What art thou?
A bastard son of Priam's.
The devil take thee, coward!
Most putrefied core, so fair without, Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
So, Ilion, fall thou next!
now, Troy, sink down!
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain, 'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.  '
Hark!
The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail; Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
Hark!
hark!
what shout is that?
Peace, drums!
Achilles!
Achilles!
Hector's slain!
Achilles.
The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
March patiently along: let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended, Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
Stand, ho!
Hector is slain.
Hector!
the gods forbid!
He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail, In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy, And linger not our sure destructions on!
My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
You understand me not that tell me so: I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death, But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in.
Hector is gone: Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
But hear you, hear you!
Hence, broker lackey!
A goodly medicine for my aching bones!
O world!
world!
world!
thus is the poor agent despised!
O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a work, and how ill requited!
why should our endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
If music be the food of love, play on.
Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.
That strain again, it had a dying fall.
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odor.
Enough, no more.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
Will you go hunt, my lord?
What, Curio?
The hart.
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
Oh, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purged the air of pestilence.
What country, friends, is this?
This is Illyria, lady.
And what should I do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.
Perchance he is not drown’d.
What think you, sailors?
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
O, my poor brother!
And so perchance may he be.
True, madam.
For saying so, there’s gold.
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him.
Know’st thou this country?
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.
Who governs here?
What is his name?
Orsino.
And so is now, or was so very late.
For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur  as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of  That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
What’s she?
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.
That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the duke’s.
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee and I’ll pay thee bounteously  Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
I’ll serve this duke.
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him.
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap to time I will commit.
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
I thank thee.
Lead me on.
What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus?
I am sure care’s an enemy to life.
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.
Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
Why, let her except, before excepted.
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
Confine?
I’ll confine myself no finer than I am.
These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too.
An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
Ay, he.
He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.
What’s that to the purpose?
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats.
He’s a very fool and a prodigal.
Fie, that you’ll say so!
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.
Who are they?
They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.
With drinking healths to my niece.
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.
Sir Toby Belch!
How now, Sir Toby Belch!
Sweet Sir Andrew!
Bless you, fair shrew.
And you too, sir.
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
What’s that?
My niece’s chambermaid.
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
My name is Mary, sir.
Good Mistress Mary Accost
You mistake, knight.
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
Is that the meaning of “accost”?
Fare you well, gentlemen.
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again.
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.
Now, sir, thought is free.
I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink.
Wherefore, sweetheart?
What’s your metaphor?
It’s dry, sir.
Why, I think so.
I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry.
But what’s your jest?
A dry jest, sir.
Are you full of them?
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends.
O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary.
When did I see thee so put down?
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has.
But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.
No question.
An I thought that, I’d forswear it.
I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Pourquoi, my dear knight?
What is “pourquoi”?
Do, or not do?
I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear baiting.
O, had I but followed the arts!
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Why, would that have mended my hair?
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?
Excellent.
It hangs like flax on a distaff.
And I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Your niece will not be seen.
Or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me.
The count himself here hard by woos her.
She’ll none o' the count.
I’ll stay a month longer.
I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world.
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters.
And yet I will not compare with an old man.
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
Faith, I can cut a caper.
And I can cut the mutton to ’t.
And I think I have the back trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.
Wherefore are these things hid?
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?
Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto?
My very walk should be a jig.
I would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace.
What dost thou mean?
Is it a world to hide virtues in?
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun colored stock.
Shall we set about some revels?
What shall we do else?
Were we not born under Taurus?
Taurus!
That’s sides and heart.
No, sir, it is legs and thighs.
Let me see the caper.
Ha, higher!
Ha, ha, excellent!
If the duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced.
He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love.
Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors?
No, believe me.
I thank you.
Here comes the count.
Who saw Cesario, ho?
On your attendance, my lord, here.
Stand you a while aloof.
Cesario, Thou know’st no less but all.
I have unclasped To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandoned to her sorrow As it is spoke , she never will admit me.
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
O, then unfold the passion of my love,
I think not so, my lord.
Dear lad, believe it.
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man.
Diana’s lip Is not more smooth and rubious.
Thy small pipe Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound, And all is semblative a woman’s part.
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair.
Some four or five attend him.
All, if you will, for I myself am best When least in company.
Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine.
Let her hang me.
He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors.
Make that good.
A good lenten answer.
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.
Where, good Mistress Mary?
In the wars.
And that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Well, God give them wisdom that have it.
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.
Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
You are resolute, then?
Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
That if one break, the other will hold.
Or, if both break, your gaskins fall.
Apt, in good faith, very apt.
Well, go thy way.
If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that.
Here comes my lady.
Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling!
Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools.
And I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man.
For what says Quinapalus?
“Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.
Take the fool away.
Do you not hear, fellows?
Take away the lady.
Go to, you’re a dry fool.
I’ll no more of you.
Besides, you grow dishonest.
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend.
For give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry.
Sir, I bade them take away you.
Misprision in the highest degree!
Can you do it?
Dexterously, good madonna.
Make your proof.
I must catechise you for it, madonna.
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.
Good madonna, why mournest thou?
Good fool, for my brother’s death.
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven.
Take away the fool, gentlemen.
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?
Doth he not mend?
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him.
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.
How say you to that, Malvolio?
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal.
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone.
Look you now, he’s out of his guard already.
Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged.
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.
Oh, you are sick of self love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.
To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets.
There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail.
Nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.
From the Count Orsino, is it?
I know not, madam.
'Tis a fair young man, and well attended.
Who of my people hold him in delay?
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
Fetch him off, I pray you.
He speaks nothing but madman.
Fie on him!
By mine honor, half drunk.
What is he at the gate, cousin?
A gentleman.
A gentleman?
What gentleman?
'Tis a gentleman here  a plague o' these pickle herring!
How now, sot!
Good Sir Toby!
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
Lechery!
I defy lechery.
There’s one at the gate.
Ay, marry, what is he?
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.
Give me faith, say I.
Well, it’s all one.
What’s a drunken man like, fool?
Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman.
One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.
He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the madman.
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.
I told him you were sick.
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.
I told him you were asleep.
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you.
What is to be said to him, lady?
He’s fortified against any denial.
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
He's been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.
What kind o' man is he?
Why, of mankind.
What manner of man?
Of very ill manner.
He’ll speak with you, will you or no.
Of what personage and years is he?
Let him approach.
Call in my gentlewoman.
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
Give me my veil.
Come, throw it o'er my face.
We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
Speak to me.
I shall answer for her.
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.
I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it.
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn.
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
Whence came you, sir?
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part.
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.
Are you a comedian?
No, my profound heart.
And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play.
Are you the lady of the house?
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
Come to what is important in ’t.
I forgive you the
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.
It is the more like to be feigned.
I pray you, keep it in.
I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you.
If you be not mad, be gone.
If you have reason, be brief.
Will you hoist sail, sir?
Here lies your way.
No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.
Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
Tell me your mind.
I am a messenger.
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful.
Speak your office.
It alone concerns your ear.
I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage.
I hold the olive in my hand .
My words are as full of peace as matter.
Yet you began rudely.
What are you?
What would you?
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment.
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead.
To your ears, divinity.
To any other’s, profanation.
Give us the place alone.
We will hear this divinity.
Most sweet lady
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
Where lies your text?
In Orsino’s bosom.
In his bosom?
In what chapter of his bosom?
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
Oh, I have read it.
It is heresy.
Have you no more to say?
Good madam, let me see your face.
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
You are now out of your text.
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.
Is ’t not well done?
Excellently done, if God did all.
'Tis in grain, sir.
'Twill endure wind and weather.
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.
Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy.
O, sir, I will not be so hard hearted.
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.
I see you what you are, you are too proud.
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
My lord and master loves you.
Oh, such love Could be but recompensed though you were crowned The nonpareil of beauty.
How does he love me?
With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
Your lord does know my mind.
I cannot love him.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth.
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person.
But yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.
If I did love you in my master’s flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it.
Why, what would you?
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house.
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night.
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills And make the babbling gossip of the air
You might do much.
What is your parentage?
Get you to your lord.
I cannot love him.
Let him send no more  Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it.
Fare you well.
I thank you for your pains.
Spend this for me.
I am no fee’d post, lady.
Keep your purse.
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervor, like my master’s, be Placed in contempt.
Farewell, fair cruelty.
Here, madam, at your service.
Run after that same peevish messenger, The county’s man.
He left this ring behind him, Would I or not.
Tell him I’ll none of it.
Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes.
I am not for him.
If that the youth will come this way tomorrow, I’ll give him reasons for ’t.
Hie thee, Malvolio.
Madam, I will.
By your patience, no.
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
No, sooth, sir.
Alas the day!
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.
But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair.
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there.
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
Even now, sir.
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
She returns this ring to you, sir.
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him.
And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this.
Receive it so.
She took the ring of me.
I’ll none of it.
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned.
If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye.
If not, be it his that finds it.
I left no ring with her.
What means this lady?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!
She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly.
She loves me, sure!
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger.
None of my lord’s ring?
Why, he sent her none.
I am the man.
If it be so, as ’tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness, Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
How easy is it for the proper false In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we, For such as we are made of, such we be.
How will this fadge?
Approach, Sir Andrew.
Nay, my troth, I know not.
But I know to be up late is to be up late.
A false conclusion.
I hate it as an unfilled can.
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early, so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes.
Does not our life consist of the four elements?
Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.
Thou'rt a scholar.
Let us therefore eat and drink.
Marian, I say!
A stoup of wine!
Here comes the fool, i' faith.
How now, my hearts!
Did you never see the picture of “We Three”?
Welcome, ass.
Now let’s have a catch.
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.
I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock.
My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle ale houses.
Excellent!
Why, this is the best fooling when all is done.
Now, a song.
Come on.
There is sixpence for you.
Let’s have a song.
There’s a testril of me too.
If one knight give a
Would you have a love song or a song of good life?
A love song, a love song.
Ay, ay.
I care not for good life.
Excellent good, i' faith.
Good, good.
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
A contagious breath.
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
But shall we make the welkin dance indeed?
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver?
Shall we do that?
An you love me, let’s do ’t.
I am dog at a catch.
By 'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
Most certain.
Let our catch be “Thou Knave.
“Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight?
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight.
'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me “knave.
” Begin, Fool.
It begins “Hold thy peace.
I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
Good, i' faith.
Come, begin.
What a caterwauling do you keep here!
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.
My lady’s a Cataian.
Beshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.
Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too.
He does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.
For the love o' God, peace!
My masters, are you mad?
Or what are you?
Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?
Do you make an alehouse of my lady’s house, that you squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice?
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.
Sneck up!
Sir Toby, I must be round with you.
My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders.
Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.
No, good Sir Toby.
Is ’t even so?
But I will never die.
This is much credit to you.
Shall I bid him go?
Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
Out o' tune, sir.
You lie.
Art any more than a steward?
Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.
Thou'rt i' the right.
Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs.
A stoup of wine, Maria!
Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule.
She shall know of it, by this hand.
Go shake your ears!
Do ’t, knight.
I’ll write thee a challenge.
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight.
Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet.
For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him.
If I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed.
I know I can do it.
Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!
What, for being a puritan?
Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?
I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have reason good enough.
What wilt thou do?
Excellent!
I smell a device.
I have ’t in my nose too.
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.
And your horse now would make him an ass.
Ass, I doubt not.
Oh, ’twill be admirable!
Sport royal, I warrant you.
I know my physic will work with him.
I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.
Observe his construction of it.
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.
Farewell.
Good night, Penthesilea.
Before me, she’s a good wench.
She’s a beagle, true bred, and one that adores me.
What o' that?
I was adored once too.
Let’s to bed, knight.
Thou hadst need send for more money.
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
Send for money, knight.
If thou hast her not i' the end, call me “Cut.
If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack.
'Tis too late to go to bed now.
Come, knight.
Come, knight.
Give me some music.
Now, good morrow, friends.
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night.
Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy paced times: Come, but one verse.
He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.
Who was it?
Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady Olivia’s father took much delight in.
He is about the house.
Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is throned.
Thou dost speak masterly.
My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.
Hath it not, boy?
A little, by your favor.
What kind of woman is’t?
Of your complexion.
She is not worth thee, then.
What years, i' faith?
About your years, my lord.
Too old by heaven.
I think it well, my lord.
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.
For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
And so they are.
Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!
O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
Are you ready, sir?
Ay; prithee, sing.
There’s for thy pains.
No pains, sir.
I take pleasure in singing, sir.
I’ll pay thy pleasure then.
Give me now leave to leave thee.
Let all the rest give place.
But if she cannot love you, sir?
I cannot be so answer’d.
Sooth, but you must.
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart.
No woman’s heart So big, to hold so much.
They lack retention.
Ay, but I know
What dost thou know?
Too well what love women to men may owe.
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship.
And what’s her history?
A blank, my lord.
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
I am all the daughters of my father’s house, And all the brothers too and yet I know not.
Sir, shall I to this lady?
Ay, that’s the theme.
To her in haste.
Give her this jewel.
Say My love can give no place, bide no denay.
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
Nay, I’ll come.
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame?
I would exult, man.
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear baiting here.
To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue.
Shall we not, Sir Andrew?
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
Here comes the little villain.
Get you all three into the boxtree.
Malvolio’s coming down this walk.
He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour.
Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.
Close, in the name of jesting!
'Tis but fortune, all is fortune.
Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion.
Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.
What should I think on ’t?
Here’s an overweening rogue!
O, peace!
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
Peace, I say.
To be Count Malvolio!
Ah, rogue!
Pistol him, pistol him.
Peace, peace!
There is example for ’t.
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
Fie on him, Jezebel!
O, peace!
Now he’s deeply in.
Look how imagination blows him.
Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state
Oh, for a stone bow, to hit him in the eye!
Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed, where I have left Olivia sleeping
Fire and brimstone!
O, peace, peace!
And then to have the humor of state, and after a demure travel of regard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby
Bolts and shackles!
O peace, peace, peace!
Now, now.
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him.
I frown the while, and perchance wind up watch, or play with my some rich jewel.
Toby approaches, curtsies there to me
Shall this fellow live?
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech ”
What, what?
“You must amend your drunkenness.
Out, scab!
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
“Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight ”
That’s me, I warrant you.
“One Sir Andrew ”
I knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.
What employment have we here?
Now is the woodcock near the gin.
O, peace!
And the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him!
By my life, this is my lady’s hand these be her very C’s, her U’s and her T’s and thus makes she her great P’s.
It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
Her C’s, her U’s and her T’s.
Why that?
This wins him, liver and all.
“Jove knows I love, But who?
Lips, do not move; No man must know.
” “No man must know.
” What follows?
The numbers altered.
“No man must know.
” If this should be thee, Malvolio?
Marry, hang thee, brock!
“I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore; M.  O.
A.  I.   doth sway my life.
”
A fustian riddle!
Excellent wench, say I.
“M.
O.
A.  I.   doth sway my life.
What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
And with what wing the staniel checks at it!
“I may command where I adore.
” Why, she may command me.
I serve her, she is my lady.
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity.
There is no obstruction in this.
And the end what should that alphabetical position portend?
If I could make that resemble something in me Softly!
M.  O.
A.  I.
O, ay, make up that.
He is now at a cold scent.
Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.
“M” Malvolio.
“M” why, that begins my name.
Did not I say he would work it out?
The cur is excellent at faults.
Ay, or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry “O!
And then “I” comes behind.
Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.
“M.
O.
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
I could marry this wench for this device.
So could I too.
Nor I neither.
Here comes my noble gull catcher.
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
Or o' mine either?
Shall I play my freedom at tray trip, and become thy bondslave?
I' faith, or I either?
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
Like aqua vitae with a midwife.
If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady.
He will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color she abhors, and cross gartered, a fashion she detests.
To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
I’ll make one too.
Save thee, friend, and thy music.
Dost thou live by thy tabour?
No, sir, I live by the church.
Art thou a churchman?
No such matter, sir.
I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.
You have said, sir.
To see this age!
Nay, that’s certain.
They that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.
I would therefore my sister had no name, sir.
Why, man?
Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton.
Thy reason, man?
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Not so, sir, I do care for something.
But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you.
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly.
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun.
It shines everywhere.
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
By my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, (  aside] though I would not have it grow on my chin.
Is thy lady within?
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
Yes, being kept together and put to use.
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.
I understand you, sir.
'Tis well begged.
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar.
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit.
He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And, like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye.
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man’s art, For folly that he wisely shows is fit.
Save you, gentleman.
And you, sir.
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
Et vous aussi.
Votre serviteur!
I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.
Will you encounter the house?
My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
I am bound to your niece, sir.
I mean, she is the list of my voyage.
Taste your legs, sir.
My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
I will answer you with gait and entrance.
But we are prevented.
That youth’s a rare courtier.
“Rain odors.
” Well.
My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
“Odors,” “pregnant,” and “vouchsafed.
” I’ll get 'em all three all ready.
Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
My duty, madam, and most humble service.
What is your name?
Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.
My servant, sir!
'Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment.
You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
And he is yours, and his must needs be yours: Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.
For him, I think not on him.
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.
O, by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him.
But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.
Dear lady
Give me leave, beseech you.
I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you.
I pity you.
That’s a degree to love.
No, not a grize.
For ’tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies.
Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again.
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf!
Then westward ho!
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!
You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
That you do think you are not what you are.
If I think so, I think the same of you.
I would you were as I would have you be!
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
(  aside] Oh, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip!
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid.
By innocence I swear, and by my youth I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has, nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
And so adieu, good madam.
Nevermore Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.
Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me.
I saw’t i'the orchard.
Did she see thee the while, old boy?
Tell me that.
As plain as I see you now.
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.
And they have been grand jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness.
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked.
An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate.
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor.
Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him.
Hurt him in eleven places.
My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
Go, write it in a martial hand.
Be curst and brief.
It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention.
Taunt him with the license of ink.
Where shall I find you?
We’ll call thee at the cubiculo.
Go.
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver ’t?
Never trust me, then.
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.
For Andrew, if he were opened and
And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.
And cross gartered?
Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church.
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
I would not by my will have troubled you, But, since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you.
I could not stay behind you.
My desire, More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth.
My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks.
Tomorrow, sir.
Best first go see your lodging.
Belike you slew great number of his people?
The offence is not of such a bloody nature; Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument.
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did.
Do not then walk too open.
It doth not fit me.
Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge.
Why I your purse?
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
I’ll be your purse bearer and leave you For an hour.
To the Elephant.
I do remember.
I have sent after him.
He says he’ll come.
How shall I feast him?
What bestow of him?
He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner.
He is sure possessed, madam.
Why, what’s the matter?
Does he rave?
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.
Go call him hither.
Sweet lady, ho, ho.
Smilest thou?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
Sad, lady!
I could be sad.
This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross gartering, but what of that?
If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.
Why, how dost thou, man?
What is the matter with thee?
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
To bed?
“Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.
God comfort thee!
Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?
How do you, Malvolio?
At your request!
Yes, nightingales answer daws!
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
“Be not afraid of greatness.
” 'Twas well writ.
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
“Some are born great ”
Ha?
“Some achieve greatness ”
What sayest thou?
“And some have greatness thrust upon them.
Heaven restore thee!
“Remember who commended thy yellow stockings ”
Thy yellow stockings?
Cross gartered?
Am I made?
“If not, let me see thee a servant still.
Why, this is very midsummer madness.
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned.
I’ll come to him.
Oh, ho!
Do you come near me now?
No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me.
This concurs directly with the letter.
She sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that in the letter.
“Cast thy humble slough,” says she.
“Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants.
Which way is he, in the name of sanctity?
Here he is, here he is.
How is’t with you, sir?
How is’t with you, man?
Go off, I discard you.
Let me enjoy my private.
Go off.
Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him!
Did not I tell you?
Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.
Aha!
Does she so?
Go to, go to!
Peace, peace.
We must deal gently with him.
Let me alone.
How do you, Malvolio?
How is ’t with you?
What, man, defy the devil!
Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.
Do you know what you say?
La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart!
Pray God, he be not bewitched!
Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live.
My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.
How now, mistress?
O Lord!
Prithee, hold thy peace.
This is not the way.
Do you not see you move him?
Let me alone with him.
No way but gentleness, gently, gently.
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.
Why, how now, my bawcock!
How dost thou, chuck?
Sir!
Ay, Biddy, come with me.
What, man!
'Tis not for gravity to play at cherry pit with Satan.
Hang him, foul collier!
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
My prayers, minx?
No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
Go, hang yourselves all!
You are idle, shallow things.
I am not of your element.
You shall know more hereafter.
Is ’t possible?
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
The house will be the quieter.
Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound.
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad.
We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen.
But see, but see!
More matter for a May morning.
Here’s the challenge, read it.
Warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.
Is ’t so saucy?
Ay, is ’t, I warrant him.
Do but read.
Give me.
“Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.
Good, and valiant.
“Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for ’t.
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.
“Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly.
But thou liest in thy throat.
That is not the matter I challenge thee for.
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense less.
“I will waylay thee going home, where if it be thy chance to kill me ”
Good.
“Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law.
Good.
“Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls.
He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself.
You may have very fit occasion for ’t.
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.
Go, Sir Andrew.
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum baily.
So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou drawest, swear horrible, for it
Nay, let me alone for swearing.
Here he comes with your niece.
Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.
I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t.
There’s something in me that reproves my fault, But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof.
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master’s grief.
Here, wear this jewel for me.
'Tis my picture.
Refuse it not.
It hath no tongue to vex you.
And I beseech you come again tomorrow.
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny, That honor, saved, may upon asking give?
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you?
I will acquit you.
Well, come again tomorrow.
Fare thee well.
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
Gentleman, God save thee.
And you, sir.
That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end.
Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.
You mistake, sir.
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.
You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you.
Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
I pray you, sir, what is he?
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.
I am no fighter.
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor.
Belike this is a man of that quirk.
Sir, no.
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury.
Therefore get you on and give him his desire.
This is as uncivil as strange.
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is.
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
I will do so.
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
I shall be much bound to you for ’t.
I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight.
I care not who knows so much of my mettle.
Why, man, he’s a very devil.
I have not seen such a firago.
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable.
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
Pox on ’t!
I’ll not meddle with him.
Ay, but he will not now be pacified.
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.
Plague on ’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him.
Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray Capilet.
I’ll make the motion.
Stand here, make a good show on ’t.
This shall end without the perdition of souls.
Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
There’s no remedy, sir; he will fight with you for ’s oath sake.
Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of.
Therefore, draw for the supportance of his vow.
He protests he will not hurt you.
Pray God defend me!
A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
Give ground, if you see him furious.
Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy.
The gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout with you.
He cannot by the duello avoid it.
But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you.
Come on, to ’t.
Pray God, he keep his oath!
I do assure you, ’tis against my will.
Put up your sword.
If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me.
If you offend him, I for him defy you.
You, sir?
Why, what are you?
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
O good Sir Toby, hold!
Here come the officers.
I’ll be with you anon.
Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
Marry, will I, sir.
And for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word.
He will bear you easily and reins well.
This is the man.
Do thy office.
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
You do mistake me, sir.
No, sir, no jot.
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea cap on your head.
Take him away.
He knows I know him well.
I must obey.
This comes with seeking you: But there’s no remedy.
I shall answer it .
What will you do, now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse?
Come, sir, away.
I must entreat of you some of that money.
What money, sir?
For the fair kindness you have showed me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I’ll lend you something.
My having is not much.
I’ll make division of my present with you.
Hold, there’s half my coffer.
Will you deny me now?
Is ’t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion?
Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you.
I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature.
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood
O heavens themselves!
Come, sir, I pray you, go.
Let me speak a little.
This youth that you see here I snatched one half out of the jaws of death, Relieved him with such sanctity of love, And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
What’s that to us?
The time goes by.
Away!
But oh, how vile an idol proves this god!
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
The man grows mad.
Away with him.
Come, come, sir.
Lead me on.
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself.
So do not I.
Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
Come hither, knight.
Come hither, Fabian.
We’ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
He named Sebastian.
I my brother know Yet living in my glass.
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare.
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
'Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.
Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
An I do not
Come, let’s see the event.
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow.
Let me be clear of thee.
Well held out, i' faith.
No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither.
Nothing that is so is so.
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.
Thou know’st not me.
Vent my folly?
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool.
Vent my folly!
I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.
I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady.
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.
There’s money for thee.
If you tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.
By my troth, thou hast an open hand.
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years' purchase.
Now, sir, have I met you again?
There’s for you.
Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there.
Are all the people mad?
Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.
This will I tell my lady straight.
I would not be in some of your coats for two pence.
Come on, sir, hold!
Nay, let him alone.
I’ll go another way to work with him.
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.
Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
Let go thy hand.
Come, sir, I will not let you go.
Come, my young soldier, put up your iron.
You are well fleshed.
Come on.
I will be free from thee.
What, what?
Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.
Hold, Toby!
On thy life I charge thee, hold!
Madam!
Will it be ever thus?
What relish is in this?
How runs the stream?
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream.
Nay, come, I prithee.
Would thou’dst be ruled by me!
Madam, I will.
Oh, say so, and so be!
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard.
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate.
Do it quickly.
I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.
Jove bless thee, master Parson.
Bonos dies, Sir Toby.
For, as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, “That that is is.
” So I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson.
For, what is “that” but “that,” and “is” but “is”?
To him, Sir Topas.
What ho, I say!
Peace in this prison!
The knave counterfeits well.
A good knave.
Who calls there?
Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady
Out, hyperbolical fiend!
How vexest thou this man!
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
Well said, Master Parson.
Fie, thou dishonest Satan!
I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy.
Sayest thou that house is dark?
As hell, Sir Topas.
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony.
And yet complainest thou of obstruction?
I am not mad, Sir Topas.
I say to you this house is dark.
Madman, thou errest.
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.
I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell.
And I say, there was never man thus abused.
I am no more mad than you are.
Make the trial of it in any constant question.
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
What thinkest thou of his opinion?
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
Fare thee well.
Remain thou still in darkness.
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.
Fare thee well.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
My most exquisite Sir Topas!
Nay, I am for all waters.
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.
He sees thee not.
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him.
I would we were well rid of this knavery.
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.
Come by and by to my chamber.
Hey, Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does.
Fool!
My lady is unkind, perdy.
Fool!
Fool, I say!
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper.
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.
Master Malvolio?
Ay, good fool.
Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
But as well?
Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.
They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness, send ministers to me  asses!
and do all they can to face me out of my wits.
Advise you what you say.
The minister is here.
Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
Endeavor thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.
Sir Topas!
Maintain no words with him, good fellow.
Who, I, sir?
Not I, sir.
God b' wi' you, good Sir Topas.
Marry, amen.
I will, sir, I will.
Fool, fool, fool, I say!
Alas, sir, be patient.
What say you sir?
I am shent for speaking to you.
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.
I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
Well a day that you were, sir.
By this hand, I am.
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
I will help you to ’t.
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?
Or do you but counterfeit?
Believe me, I am not.
I tell thee true.
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.
I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.
I prithee, be gone.
This is the air, that is the glorious sun.
Blame not this haste of mine.
If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by.
I’ll follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine.
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
Anything.
Do not desire to see this letter.
This is, to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again.
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.
I know thee well.
How dost thou, my good fellow?
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
Just the contrary.
The better for thy friends.
No, sir, the worse.
How can that be?
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass.
So that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my
Why, this is excellent.
By my troth, sir, no though it please you to be one of my friends.
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold.
But that it would be double dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.
O, you give me ill counsel.
Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double dealer.
There’s another.
Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all.
The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind one, two, three.
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw.
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
I know not what ’twas but distraction.
Notable pirate!
Thou saltwater thief, What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies, Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies?
Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me.
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy.
A witchcraft drew me hither.
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem.
A wreck past hope he was.
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication.
How can this be?
When came he to this town?
What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
Madam?
Gracious Olivia
What do you say, Cesario?
Good my lord
My lord would speak.
My duty hushes me.
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music.
Still so cruel?
Still so constant, lord.
What, to perverseness?
You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered  what shall I do?
Even what it please my lord that shall become him.
Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?
A savage jealousy That sometimes savors nobly.
And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
Where goes Cesario?
After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above, Punish my life for tainting of my love!
Ay me, detested!
How am I beguiled!
Who does beguile you?
Who does do you wrong?
Hast thou forgot thyself?
Is it so long?
Call forth the holy father.
Come, away!
Whither, my lord?
Cesario, husband, stay.
Husband?
Ay, husband.
Can he that deny?
Her husband, sirrah?
No, my lord, not I.
Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety.
Fear not, Cesario.
Take thy fortunes up.
Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st.
O thou dissembling cub!
What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
My lord, I do protest
O, do not swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
For the love of God, a surgeon!
Send one presently to Sir Toby.
What’s the matter?
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.
For the love of God, your help!
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario.
We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.
My gentleman, Cesario?
'Od’s lifelings, here he is!
Why do you speak to me?
I never hurt you.
You drew your sword upon me without cause, But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not.
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me.
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
How now, gentleman?
How is ’t with you?
That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t.
Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?
Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone.
His eyes were set at eight i' the morning.
Then he’s a rogue, and a passy measures pavin.
I hate a drunken rogue.
Away with him!
Who hath made this havoc with them?
I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!
A natural perspective, that is and is not!
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee!
Sebastian are you?
Fear’st thou that, Antonio?
How have you made division of yourself?
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures.
Which is Sebastian?
Most wonderful!
Do I stand there?
I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature, Of here and everywhere.
I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman?
What name?
What parentage?
Of Messaline.
My father had a mole upon his brow.
And so had mine.
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years.
Oh, that record is lively in my soul!
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years.
So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived.
Be not amazed.
Right noble is his blood.
And all those sayings will I overswear; And those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbèd continent the fire That severs day from night.
Give me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments.
He shall enlarge him.
Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do.
Has here writ a letter to you.
I should have given ’t you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.
Open ’t, and read it.
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman.
“By the Lord, madam,”
How now?
Art thou mad?
No, madam, I do but read madness.
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Read it you, sirrah.
“By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it.
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship.
I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame.
Think of me as you please.
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury.
The madly used Malvolio.
Did he write this?
Ay, madam.
This savors not much of distraction.
See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
A sister!
You are she.
Is this the madman?
Ay, my lord, this same.
How now, Malvolio!
Madam, you have done me wrong,
Have I, Malvolio?
No.
Lady, you have.
Pray you, peruse that letter.
You must not now deny it is your hand.
Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase; Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention: You can say none of this.
Well, grant it then And tell me, in the modesty of honor, Why you have given me such clear lights of favor, Bade me come smiling and cross gartered to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?
And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention played on?
Tell me why.
Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder’d at.
In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him.
Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance, In recompense whereof he hath married her.
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.
” I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one.
“By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.
”  But do you remember?
I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
He hath been most notoriously abused.
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.
